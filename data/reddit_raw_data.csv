In India, as we grow older and start working, we often forget about our old hobbies & the things which we used to enjoy when we were younger. 

This lockdown will last a minimum of 21 days, and everyone needs to find quality activities to fill their schedule with & things to enjoy with their families.

Scheduled,I am from Shaheen Bagh and I hope the protest here ends.,30,fahqeu,zafar_bull,15,"I remember the day of violence at Jamia university. I had just come from office and one of my friend who was in the rally that had tried marching towards parliament and as soon as it had reached Mathura Road, a major road in Delhi, the rally faced an unexpected amount of force from police, a violent lathi-charge. He said, people ran in all directions and cops chased them all over. Next thing he sees is buses burning, police firing gun on protestors. 

All I said to him is, "" I wish people didn't protest because this will not yield anything"", he didn't believe me so, I switched on my TV and showed him the narrative that was spun on the incident by media. He was shocked. Next day Shaheen Bagh protest started and rest is history. But never once did I think from day one that BJP will talk or courts will intervene. And never believed that this was a good idea as Shaheen Bagh road is major thoroughfare between Noida , Delhi, Faridabad and Gurgaon and hence it will only make more haters because I know most people don't really care what the Indian Muslim thinks. 

It has all come true, and today as more than ever, I wish this protest ended. 

I was brought up in India and never did I consider this country to be more than a Hindu nation, with Muslims living in their ""aukaat"". I grew up watching Mahabharata, Ramayana and om namah shivay on government owned national television, visited government offices with temples and other unlimited signs of Hinduism in government that established that. As you grew older, met kids who had never met a Muslim and knew zilch about Islam but could tell you 100s of stereotypes about Muslims as facts. Countless incidents made an imprint on you and you learnt to keep your head down and just live in your ghetto. But now my ghetto, which is chose for security over facilities is gone. 

But the thing is, I had learnt to live with that. But this protest makes me feel unsafe. I feel noticed. I don't want that. Till this protest , nobody knew what was Shaheen Bagh, I liked that. Now I feel exposed and worried that I might have crossed my ""aukaat"" and will soon feel the punishment for it. So please my friends at the protest, please stop it.



PS: just my rant, thought, don't downvote because you don't agree, kindly comment or else move on.

Edit : I also do not want the protest to end. You have to understand that as a Muslim in India, I am used to keeping my head down and going on with life. But this, this is totally new. This is a revolt of a sort, which totally makes lots of people among us nervous, we get these thoughts and I just articulated it here.

Scheduled,Vegetarianism in India has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals,691,eogkmk,VelvetHedgehog,343,"
Why do vegetarians in India prefer social distance from non-vegetarians? A look at caste-wise food preferences could provide some insights. As is common knowledge, the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet. In caste-society, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously – something best embodied by a Brahmin.

The percentage of non-vegetarians among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, both for men and women, is much higher than among those who are not from these communities. And in the latter group, the highest incidence of vegetarianism is found among Brahmins at almost over 50%. The higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians.

The burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

Broadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power being forced on the non-vegetarian majority – with their consent. This new sociality is a sign of progress in modern caste belief where the seductive power of vegetarianism and its associated purity travels seamlessly across bodies and spaces without dissent.

How fragile must the morals of the vegetarian castes be if they feel threatened by the introduction of eggs for poor children in schools? The morals of Indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity. In this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung. Like humans of caste, not all animals carry equal sympathy: there exists some hierarchy where the cow (indigenous, not jersey) takes the highest sacral form compared to the rest. Gandhi improvised his vegetarianism through inflicting violence and control on the self. Present-day caste-subjects and their vegetarianism, however, thrive on violence, both on the self and others. The state across India through various governments has mostly been party to this process, promoting the hegemony of misguided vegetarianism.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eogkmk/vegetarianism_in_india_has_more_to_do_with_caste/

1. You receive a WhatsApp forward which you know is factually fake and want to report it. You can forward the message to this bot and report it as fake, and leave a note as to why you think it's fake.

2. You receive a WhatsApp forward and want to check if it's genuine before believing it/passing it on. You can forward it to the bot, and the bot will inform you how many people have reported it as fake and their reasons for doing so

Scheduled,Will I get a full refund on my Jet Airways International Flight scheduled next moent?,14,bdbpz3,CurlyMope,18,"Hi, I have a question for people well versed with flight cancellation rules. I have an international round trip flight booked with Jet on May 13. The cancellation charge per ticket is 10,500 INR. 

With all the commotion going on and Jet cancelling international flights, **is there any way I can get all my money on those tickets back** (without the losing 10,500 per ticket)?

As per the ticket fine print, I am eligible for a full refund if they reschedule or cancel. But they haven't mailed me personally about the reschedule, I have sent them a mail asking for my money.

Scheduled,Seattle city council becomes the first US legislative body to pass a resolution against CAA. Full video of the hearing and the vote that followed.,368,eykwsp,ali_sez_so,87,"This resolution was tabled on January 21st because some of the council members thought they needed to do more research after receiving an email from the Council General of India. 

It was scheduled for a hearing and vote at 2pm today. It has been a long and emotional day. There were around 200-300 people supporting the resolution and probably not more than 80 who were supporting CAA and against the resolution. They were in minority but were the loudest and were there at the city hall since 7 in the morning. Since they were first in line, they got to register for the hearing first and got the opportunity to speak. [Here is the full video of the hearing and the vote.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwygRQ6oXuQ)

One after the other they came and spoke lies about how CAA has nothing to do with Indians. They talked about how minorities are being prosecuted in Pakistan/Bangladesh, how women are being forcefully converted or raped in these countries, or how minorities went from 25% to 5% in these countries(without any source for that information). Some argued that Seattle should deal with its own problems of homelessness, drugs and crime instead of ""falling prey to hate-mongering"". One person even claimed that there is a [genocide of Hindus going on in India and the population of Hindus went down to 65%.](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=1920) Many people laughed at that. Some accused the council member Kshama Sawant and her political aspirations and her ""ulterior motives"" behind this resolution. Some even went on to claim that all these protests against CAA are sponsored by Pakistan/ISI. [And when there was finally a group to speak in favor of the resolution, the bhakts started heckling and shouting at them and the the hearing was suspended,](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=2798) which they knew would happen. When the hearing was resumed it was back to them and their lies.

After the public hearing, the council member Sawant [gave an amazing speech supporting the resolution](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=4463) and she was constantly being heckled. And then there was [this](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=5106) comment from another council member who could see the bigotry through all the comments made by the bhakts.

In the end, truth prevailed and the council members voted 5 out of 5 in favor of the resolution. 

Right when it was apparent that the resolution was going to be passed, the bhakts started [creating a ruckus](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=5574) and after multiple warnings, security was called and they were asked to leave the hall.

Scheduled,Can Indians grow a spine already?,275,f2y883,Zea-,161,"I am so sick of Indian men and women being pressured into arranged marriages. I am sick of the whole virginity being the sacred bowl of purity, sick of aunties who will keep on nagging you to get married. This is absurd. 

Everyone puts up the whole, 'Arranged marriages are done with consent' bs. Are they though? Deep inside everyone knows that the majority of the Indian population is pressured into marriage. 

Let's see, if someone pressures you to have sex, it is *sexual assault*, right? It is a crime. You shouldn't be pressured into *anything*, not even marriage. I can't believe how manipulative parents can get, 'I will slit my wrists if you don't get married', 'You will see my dead face if you don't get married'. Here's the thing, taking your own life needs a *lot of courage*, trust me, I have tried. *Your parents won't take their own lives for this*. You are an adult, probably earning, you can take care of yourself and take your own decisions. *Please don't be pressured and ruin two lives*, hell maybe 3 lives, if we assume that you will have a child. I am from a dysfunctional family, arranged marriage, of course, and my life has been hell. I remember wishing that my parents never got married, even if it resulted in me not being in this world. 

Here's the thing, life's already complicated, you need to earn, do your job, take care of yourself and others, etc, why make life more difficult with things that don't need to be complicated. Socialize, date, make friends, find common interests, know each other for *years*, marry. That's how biology of the body is. 

Some say that arranged marriages have a courtship period, but how long does it last? The maximum amount of time I have seen someone just being engaged in an arranged marriage is 1 year. Not to mention, the courtships can be in an controlled environment and fixed meeting and schedules. How can you be sure your partner wants to marry? Hell, how can you be sure? Is it because *this is just the next step*? What if your sexual libidos, kinks don't match?
 I, for a fact know that I won't marry someone until I have know them for atleast 3 years! It's sad to see where the society is going. You can say that that's how the culture of India is, but does the culture have any value if it suppresses and unnaturalizes the whole concept of love and relationships, the way biology works? If it affects mental health? After all, isn't culture just man-made? Only the positive aspects of culture should be kept. Relationships, sex, love are natural. Nothing *sacred*. If you want arrange marriage, good for you, just make sure your partner has *actually consented*.

Sincerely, a rant by me. Seeing my dear best friend in depression after being emotionally blackmailed into a marriage with same threats of suicide, 'log kya kahenge', etc has been terrible. Know that parents are not Gods, they are humans whom you should definitely respect but they *do* make mistakes. Even if love marriage doesn't work, you have yourself to blame, not your parents and part in your own terms. If you are pressured into a marriage, how can you say that you won't be pressured to no divorce? 

Stand up for yourself.

Edit: This is amusing. I would like to point out few things,

1) I am not claiming that *all* arranged marriages are forced. I have just stated how forced marriages do happen. Some people have taken it personally.  *I just feel it is projection*.
2) Many people are denying this, but it happens. A lot. To the point that it is so normalized that you don't feel it. *This is not a village thing. The friend I mentioned is from Mumbai*.
3) The ""I am a virgin, I want a virgin"". Okay, good for you, it's just, I feel that you are insecure about yourself. Atleast, that's how it looks like to me, as  a girl. (Oh, I am a *virgin* girl, so don't come at spewing shit like, ""You had sex that's why you don't want virginity to be considered""). If not, tell me why your partner's virginity matters to you, if it's not insecurity. It's a preference? Well, why is it? I mean, given the trend in the comments, most of you want to marry for sex. Which defiles marriage in itself, which you claim is sacred.
4) if calling me names, saying I am a weak shit for pointing out the obvious things happening in the society *and denying that it happens* makes you feel better, well, you do you. Classic ad hominem. Oh, you can say that I am generalising, and you know what, maybe I am, because generalizations always have a bit of truth of the society in them.
5) ""I won't get a good looking girl if I don't have an arranged marriage"". Oh my, that is so shallow. Just like a girl asking for 6 figures is wrong, then so is you asking for a good looking girl. Don't cry foul that women want money and gold diggers when you are just as shallow as them. I guess the quote should go, 'Don't judge a person until it's time for marriage'.
6) MARRIAGE IS NOT A CONTRACT AND DEFINITELY NOT A PASS FOR SEX. If you are marrying just for sex,   you are pitiful. Screams lack of confidence in yourself. People need to work on themselves, you don't get things you want just by sitting and hoping to get it. Since, most arguments are from men here, I have noticed that they are happy that they don't have to do anything and their parents get them a bride and sex while the bride gets 'financial security'. Reminds me of how you have to pay a prostitute to get sex, except here, it has a better name. 

Again, I would like to clear that I am against 'forced arranged marriages', though I am not a huge fan of the business like transaction of arranged marriages, what people want is none of concern. People have started bashing it as if I am totally against arranged marriage. Though, I have tried to counter the points which have been posted in defense of arranged marriage (and I didn't find them convincing). Though most of them argue about how arranged marriages are not bad, which I agree. *It's just how it happens here, is bad*. And I have tried to counter them too, though those have no relation to the whole point of the post. Which is how many are being forced into marriage and how it is so normalized in the present society.

Oof, formatting in reddit sucks. And I have realized that India has a *long, long* way to go.

Indians who are either affected by these calamities or who require financial aid for treatment of major diseases at Government/PMNRF empanelled hospitals can partially defray the expenses. Has anyone ever directly benefited by the scheme? Funny, FAQ Q18 reads as 'since a large number of requests are received seeking financial assistance for medical treatment, it is not possible to accommodate all requests due to limited resources.'
Limited resources? They had 570.68 crores in surplus from just one year? 
Also it is mentioned that the balance amount(which are significant surplus since 2011-12) is ""invested"" in various forms with scheduled banks and other agencies to ensure long term sustainability. So, about 75% of last year's funds are ""invested""?
We keep getting posts on r/india of doctors working with limited resources and have a lack of proper protective equipments. Why haven't been a lot of these funds transferred in times of crisis or better, for improvement of healthcare facilities?

Scheduled,TIFU by being from a Scheduled Caste but apparently not looking like one,343,7jhqsa,whiteobsidian,264,"Sorry for the dramatic title. Also as TIFUs usually go, this did not happen today but over a period of a month

A little background, I'm a 27 year old male, IIM passout. working in a well known consulting firm earning about 30LPA. I am a sincere, hardworking, simple dude. Since most caste related discussions always end up about reservation, lemme clarify that I never used it. Got 99.4 %ile in CAT, also had got AIR in 600's general in IITJEE. But here's the catch, despite being a Telugu SC, apparently I don't look like one. I am light-skinned and have good facial features I guess.

So I figured I was ready to get married. Since I had no luck on Tinder and was extremely busy to go out and find someone, I created a profile on one of those matrimony websites for professionals because I want an educated, broad-minded working wife. MISTAKE #1. Most of the profiles on there were of girls from highly educated backgrounds and thats the reason I thought I could find someone like me whom I could connect with in terms of principles, attitude toward education/work/life, my agnostic beliefs etc.

I checked the 'Any' option on caste as it doesn't matter to me and figured since this is a place for educated professionals, nobody really cares about caste. MISTAKE #2.

So within a week, I get a fair amount of matches. Some are handled by parents, some handled by the girls themselves. Here are some interesting experiences I had over a period of a month:

1) **Telugu Unkil**: Caste mentioned - Kapu. Says he is ""highly interested"" in my profile. I mail him back saying if he has any caste preferences and that I prefer open-minded people in general. Writes back saying how his daughter is very broad-minded, hates traditional mindset and they are looking for a very liberal family. I think great, I would like to know more about her and we started talking on whatsapp and we seem to hit it off pretty well. 5 days later she asks me my caste and I mention it. Ghosted. No replies, she unfriends me on facebook, blocks me on whatsapp. I move on.


2) **Gril**: Works for a big bank in Mumbai. Mentions 'Any' caste. So I think great. I message her and she accepts it. We exchange numbers and start talking. A week goes by, we have talked about our jobs, future plans, location preferences and want to schedule a personal meetup. She messages me - ""hey I think you should know this, I am from Teli caste which is OBC. Hope your parents are ok?"" I tell her I don't care and neither do my parents. Then I tell her about my caste, and she starts acting weird. Starts replying to my texts in syllables and tries to hang up on my calls. I feel bad and message her asking what ticked her off. She says that she thought I was from an upper caste and that's why she replied to my message. And now she doesn't want to proceed any further and want to cancel all further plans. I told her that it's a bit hypocritical of her that initially she was one wanting my parents to be ok with her being OBC when she thought I was from OC. 


3) **Marathi Auntie**: This one's a bit hilarious. She sends me a message saying she really liked my profile for her daughter. I look it up and sure enough - mentioned 'any caste'. I give her my number and she sends me a complete biodata about her daughter. Daughter is really pretty and from MDI Gurgaon, I think great. But she mentions caste as 'Rigvedi Brahmin'. I think oh f**k. I send her all the details, mention my caste and even bracket it with '(SC)'. Immediately she goes, ""I really like your profile. Tell me the next steps or give me your parents number"". I'm like - this can't be happening. Then it hits me that maybe she has glanced over the caste part in her hurry. So I send another text saying,- ""ma'am pls confirm that you have seen my caste, and it falls under Scheduled Caste"". Never heard back from her.


There are a few more like this. Most of the profiles message me about my caste and go silent when I mention it. I realized that all my life, my circle of friends have ranged from all castes, religions and financial backgrounds and they never made me feel like a dalit or whatever. I have lived a happy and fairly successful life. That was the reason I was ignoring the caste aspect for finding someone to spend my life. 

Now I have learnt my lesson and changed my caste to clearly say SC and will stick to my own I guess. I also feel like giving up on these matrimony websites.

Scheduled,"[AskIndia] Fathers/mothers of Reddit India, what were the 38-41 weeks of pregnancy like for you? Long post ahead.",10,fkql7h,2throwawaythrowaway,5,"Hi everyone!

I am currently in my 25th week (late 2nd trimester) and I'm trying to educate myself about what lies ahead for me. I have to zero in on the most important decision - the city of birth (job city?/my hometown?/husband's hometown?). I need to decide this ASAP as traveling after 28 weeks(April end that is) is generally not advised.

Which brings me to making this post here. I want to gather all the information/anectodes/experiences, in a countdown way, about the D-Day/D-weeks. If the circumstances allow, I would prefer a normal delivery. However, I totally understand how uncertain pregnancies can get. I just feel being informed can help us stay less anxious & not panic. Its going to be long and my thoughts might seem all over the place, so please bear with me. Here are my questions:

1) How frequent are the scheduled* OB/GYN visits in the very last month, assuming a normal pregnancy? Currently I visit once a month, for routine check up and milestone/mandated tests (flu vaccination, various blood tests, sonography, etc)

*(By scheduled I mean no complication was experienced by the woman or any urgency(water breaking, bleeding, etc) occured)

2) One lady who had the same OBGYN as me when went for her scheduled 37th week visit, was told she will have a C-Section as the child is getting overweight (weighing 3 kgs then). The OBGYN asked her to soon decide which date she would like the surgery to happen and let the doctor know. The lady said she however got labor pain the very next day and delivered via vaginal delivery. Now, I am a little skeptical here; from what I've read, **2.5-3.5 kgs is the average birth weight for newborns in India**. How can 3 kgs be overweight then? I'm already very paranoid about the state of deliveries in urban, big-name hospitals and this incident scares me more. There is no data public on the number of normal and surgical deliveries a hospital has, so that one can decide, and once you're in, you're in. After that, you have to leave everything at the doctor.

3) One lady who delivered at the same hospital (different OBGYN) as me, went at 37 weeks when she felt contractions. Her cervix was examined twice in a 5 hour span. She said she couldn't bear going through that painful examination again and asked for a C-Section herself (totally fair). My question is, are these cervix examinations by hand so necessary, when they're leaving the bearing lady in pain? Is there no other way (imaging, ultrasound, etc)? My point is those contractions could have been what is called 'false labor' and if not for the pain due to the examination, that lady could have gone home and come again full-term or when she felt contractions again?

4) My sister went for a scheduled visit in 38th week. Her cervix was examined, she started bleeding. She was told to come back if bleeding continued till evening, which it did. She had to be operated the next day, after staying in labor room for some 24-32 hours. This again makes me skeptical about cervix examinations.

5) What's the countdown going to be like? When does one know that ""yes, its now that I rush to the hospital."" Should I be scared of just a few drops of blood? Should I rush the very first time I experience period like cramps? From my few interactions with mothers, I feel 37-38 weeks is the sweet spot where many things happen. I know my post gives a lot of distrusting vibes towards doctors, that they're there to loot us, they try to 'invent' some complication in these sweet spot weeks to push for C-Sections, etc. Trust me, I would like to be proven wrong. Hence, I'm here to collect as much anectodes about false alarms, doctor sending the lady home even after mild contractions as its not time yet instead of asking to schedule a C-Section, etc as I can.

5) From what I understand, some women might never experience labor even after 40-41 weeks and hence have to be induced. Are some women induced before that too? What could lead to induction before full term?

6) Do all women having a vaginal delivery get an epidural/other pain medication, or only those who demand it when they get tired, or when they can't bear pain?

7) Did anyone research natural birth centers? There are many in the major cities, like 1) Sanctum Birth Center, Hyderabad, 2) Birth Village, Kochi, 3) Daimaas Natural Birth Center, Mumbai, 4) Apollo Cradle, Gurugram. Google reviews are mixed. Anyone undertook the services of these natural birth centers?

### So this is my situation


I on the last round of interview for an Irish company. And I don't have a passport yet ( I know it's dumb ). So I applied for the passport and went to the passport office today and my application got rejected due to the lack of identification documents.

I went there with 3 docs. Aadhar, pan And my sslc certificate.
I only have Aadhar, and pan card as identification docs. ( I have voters ID but the name in there is spelled wrong ). So the mam at the counter told me if there is any other documents I have, and suggested that I can get a online birth certificate. So I went to the near by Cafe and took a print out of the birth certificate. 

But in that, my name was given with out my initials. So the Assistant Passport officer rejected my application. 


So when I went back to ask what else I can do . The mam at the counter told me that if I applied for non tatkal passport I will need only two identification documents ( plus sslc certificate ). 

So I came back home and went to nearest *E-seva Kendra* to reapply for the passport in  non tatkal way.

## problem 2

Imagine my name is *Michael Jackson Obama*

So in my sslc certificate my name is written as *Michael JO.* And in my Aadhar and pan card it's written as *Michael Jackson Obama* . So he says that I cannot apply passport like this. I have to change my name in the sslc certificate to match my Aadhar. 

*Q1:* But the passport officer didn't mention any of these. Is that. Problem ? 

Changing my name in my sslc could take up to a couple of weeks. But if it takes that long I could lose my job.

I currently don't have licence. 

*Q2:* what are my options for getting a passport ASAP. ?


**Edit :- 10/03/2020**

I went to meet my uncle's friend who has some knowledge on these things. 

So I have been told that there will be no problem for me to apply passport via non tatkal route. 
Since my name on the PAN card and Aadhar is just expanded form of my name in the sslc certificate. So that won't be a problem. Appointment for the passport office has been scheduled at 16th March so I will post what happens next.


**Edit :- 16/04/2020**

I finished the interview in the passport office with out any trouble. They asked me which name I want in my passport. **Michael JO** or **Michael Jackson Obama**. So the whole process was over under 45mins. So waiting for police verification now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffvwej/serious_can_someone_please_suggest_me_a_way_to/

I am neither related to any political party nor I want to support or say bad about any Political Party. This post is just to appreciate Maharashtra Government and to give reason for people in Maharashtra to support the Government to fight against Coronavirus.

The steps that Maharashtra Government took to fight against Coronavirus may look drastic and unnecessary but I wish to say something about it. Many developed countries like USA, Spain, Italy etc. have taken these measures after the virus spread. In Maharashtra as of today morning, according to news channels, although there were 49 infected people, 40 of them came from other countries and just 9 were the ones who were in contact with the affected. For a  heavily populated country like India, these numbers are almost unbelievable. If the government did not take such drastic measures, these numbers would not have been so small. I agree that these measures disturb our schedule and many think that this is just a step by Medical Industries to increase income but WHO wouldn't have taken the steps during already going on recession.

These numbers are better than many Developed countries. We have to appreciate Maharashtra Government for their hardwork and co-operate with them. If everyone cooperates with the Government then Government will surely loosen the restrictions and we will have less trouble. 

Don't overestimate your immune system and don't assume that you won't get infected. Just follow the instructions given out by the Health Minister.

Important controversial Judgement: Justice Goel’s judgment on prevention of misuse of SC/ST Act in Dr. Shubhash Kashinath Mahajan vs. The State of Maharashtra, is one of the much talked about decision. Justice Goel along with Justice Lalit examined the question on the inclusion of procedural safeguards so that the provisions of Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) (SC/ST) Act 1989 are not abused for extraneous considerations. The Bench held that, a Government official cannot be prosecuted on mere allegation of committing an offence under the Act without the sanction of appointing authority. [1](https://www.indialegallive.com/constitutional-law-news/courts-news/justice-ak-goel-retires-from-sc-defends-his-judgment-in-sc-st-act-51270) [2](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/justice-ak-goel-who-ruled-on-dalit-atrocities-law-retires-from-top-court-1879280)

***So what about him?***

Let's go back to Vajpayee's government when Arun Jaitley was Minister of Law and Justice.

From Article: [Govt ignored IB report on HC judge](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Govt-ignored-IB-report-on-HC-judge/articleshow/45701970.cms).

>*High court judges are appointed in the following way: The state government sends a list of names through the governor to the chief justices of the Supreme Court and the concerned high court. This list is then sent to the law ministry, which obtains an IB report on the nominees. Thereafter, it prepares a matrix with three criteria â€” professional competence, integrity and political links.*  
>  
>*In the case of Goel, the law ministry matrix contains no entry under the ''Professional Competence'' column, while the ''Reputation/Integrity'' column bluntly says: ""Corrupt person"".*  
>  
>*The key to his subsequent appointment appears to be the listing in the political affiliation column, which notes that Goel was general secretary of the All-India Adhiwakta Parishad, the lawyers'' wing of the RSS. Curiously, among the five short-listed advocates whose integrity the IB had questioned, he was the only one cleared by the ministry.*  
>  
>*Having sent back the file once, Narayanan had the constitutional obligation of approving the appointment but he made his unhappiness clear. The President noted: ""Nonetheless, I feel that a more desirable course of action would have been to follow the same procedure as was done in a similarly placed case of the Calcutta High Court where the advice of the Chief Justice, which is integral to the selection process, was sought again and duly received...I would also appreciate if my instant observations are shared with the Chief Justice of India along with my earlier observation dated May 3, 2001 on this matter.""*

***He then became the Chief Justice of the Odisha High Court and the Gauhati High Court before becoming the Supreme Court Judge.***

The Caravan Magazine says and I quote

>*the collegium had thrice considered and decided against Mishra’s nomination; on one of these occasions, it had asked for a background check on him. According to an article in the Economic and Political Weekly, the check revealed that Mishra was close to the RSS. Any prior reservations were evidently put aside with the advent of the Modi government.*

\[But I couldn't search in *Economic and Political Weekly, If anyone finds the article, please do comment \].*

I don't want my idea of what Indians believe to be made up entirely of my family's steriotypes of what this community is. 

In addition to being of Pakistani descent and from a muslim family, I am also gay. I was shocked when India legalized gay marriage. I always thought Pakistani and Indian culture to be so similar. This was what piqued my interest in India. I wanted to gain a greater understanding of the mentality and political compass of Indians as far as I could understand it through Reddit (which I understand is not necessarily demonstrative of the majority of Indian voters).

Countless times I have been inspired by the Indian Reddit community's relentless efforts to cling to the secular identity of Indian political culture. Time and time again, I read about Indian pride for being the largest democracy. This is in most cases, within the context of a diverse community. People of every faith and every ethnicity all as Indian citizens sharing a common but spectacularly diverse culture.  

I am so glad that I chose to follow this subreddit or I probably wouldn't know that there is in fact a very large population of Indians who object to islamophobia or racist views of the vast subcultures of India. 

So I just wanted to thank everyone who stands for the Indian cultural ideal of tolerance and inclusiveness. It's very inspiring and I hope that bigots around the globe can learn a thing or two from this.

I'm planning a honeymoon trip to either Uttarakhand or Himachal for me and my fiance (Provided Corona settles down). These two are the places that we're interested in right now, but suggestions are welcome for any other hillstation/scenic places too. Budget is around 50k flexible for 3/4 days and 3/4 nights.

Even though Shimla/Manali were common choices, it looks airports are far from these places and I don't wanna sit in bus/car for 9hrs+ straight. I'm looking for places which have airports much closer and Dehradun came up. I was thinking of may be covering Dehradun, Nainital etc. in June.

1. Are Dehradun and Nainital good for a peaceful honeymoon trip? I'm not looking to cover a lot of places with a tight schedule. I'd rather visit a few calm and quiet scenic places and spend a bit of time there.
2. Is the weather nice there in June or will it be too hot? Also in case Corona situation continues how's the weather during July/August? I don't wanna extend it too much to really cold weather either.
3. I'm planning to book hotels on my own and hire a cab with driver for the duration. Any suggestion on this? Looking for reliability more than anything, since this will be our first trip I don't want any hassles as you can imagine. Or any reliable packages that I should look into?
4. Any other scenic places near to these locations that I must visit? Like I mentioned before I don't wanna spend a lot of time in car especially if the terrain is rough.

### 1) SARS-­CoV-­2 

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer­reviewed, open­access journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS­-CoV-­2, the virus causing the COVID-­19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-­2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

### 2) G20 Meeting in Saudi Arabia

* Recently, the ministers and central bankers from the world’s largest economies participated in the G20 meeting held in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia).
* It was presided by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the first Arab nation to hold the G20 presidency.
* The 2020 G20 Presidency will focus discussions, forums, working groups and Ministerial Meetings under the theme of “Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All”.

#### Key Points

* Global Economy:
   * The global economic growth remains slow and downside risks due to the geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty.
   * Though the economic growth is expected to increase in 2020 and 2021 due to loose monetary policy and an easing of trade tensions.
* IMF’ Views at the Meeting:
   * It projects a “V-shaped, rapid recovery” for the global economy, but it warns about the uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19).
   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

### 3) International Judicial Conference 2020

The International Judicial Conference 2020 was held from 21st-23rd February 2020 in New Delhi.

* The Conference was organized by the Supreme Court of India.
* The theme of the Conference was ‘Judiciary and the Changing World’.
* Important Topics of discussion at the conference included :
   * Gender Justice,
   * Contemporary Perspectives on Protection of Constitutional Values,
   * Dynamic Interpretations of the Constitution in a Changing World,
   * Harmonization of Environment Protection vis-à-vis Sustainable Development and
   * Protection of Right to Privacy in the Internet Age.

#### Highlights from the Conference

* Sustainable Development: The Indian judiciary was appreciated for its balance between development and environment, and continued guidance in it.
   * E.g. Judgement on Sardar Sarovar Project
* Increased Accessibility: The Supreme Court was hailed for the “extraordinary effort” to make its judgments more accessible to the common man by making them available in nine vernacular languages, keeping in mind the nation’s linguistic diversity.
* Gender Justice: The recent directives for granting equal status to women in the Army, guidelines for preventing sexual harassment at the workplace, etc. were appreciated.
* Global Reference: The Chief Justice of India said that the Supreme Court’s judgments are cited by courts of other countries and have served as a “beacon of hope” to independent and developing nations.
   * A 2001 verdict of the South African court cited the Indian case of Narain Das Jain v Agra Nagar Mahapalika decided by the Supreme Court in 1991 to benchmark the compensation to be provided while acquiring land.
* Use of ICT: The need for technology was highlighted to deliver speedy justice.
* The Government is making an effort to connect every court of the country to the E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project. The establishment of the National Judicial Data Grid will make court procedures easier.
* Future Challenges: It was highlighted that issues like data protection and cybercrimes pose new challenges for the judiciary.

#### E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project

* The E-Courts Project was conceptualized based on the ""National Policy and Action Plan for Implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the Indian Judiciary - 2005"" submitted by the e-Committee of the Supreme Court of India (set up in 2004).
* The main objectives of the e-Court Project are as follows:
   * To provide efficient & time-bound citizen-centric service delivery.
   * To develop, install & implement decision support systems in courts.
   * To automate the processes to provide transparency of Information access to its stakeholders.
   * To enhance judicial productivity both qualitatively & quantitatively, to make the justice delivery system affordable, accessible, cost-effective & transparent.
* The e-Courts National portal (ecourts.gov.in) was launched in 2013. This provides Case Status, daily Case-list, Cases Filed and Cases Registered through the Case information System (CIS) Software.
* The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is a part of the e-Courts Integrated Mission Mode Project. It was launched in 2015. The aim is to track judicial performance across different courts in the country.
   * The NJDG is working as a National data warehouse for case data including the orders/judgments for Courts across the country.
   * NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage & reduce pendency of cases.
   * It also helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delay and arrears in the system, facilitate better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, facilitate better resource management.
   * NJDG has specifically helped India improve its ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report.

### 4) Craspedotropis Gretathunbergae

A group of scientists has recently discovered a new species of land snail in Brunei.

* The new species reside in tropical rainforests and are sensitive to drought and extreme temperatures (which have become more frequent due to climate change).
* Hence as an honor to Swedish Climate Change activist Greta Thunberg, who has been making efforts to raise awareness about climate change, the new snail species was named Craspedotropis Gretathunbergae.
* Recently, a tiny species of beetle was also named after her as Nelloptodes Greta.
* In 2018, a new species of beetle (Grouvellinus Leonardodicaprioi) was named after the actor Leonardo DiCaprio (an American actor, producer, and environmentalist).

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

### 7) World’s largest cavefish discovered in Meghalaya

A team of experts from the UK, Switzerland, and India have discovered the world’s largest species of cavefish in Meghalaya’s Jaintia Hills.

#### About

* The cavefish, similar in anatomy to an endangered mahseer species, is around one and a half feet in length and was found inside a remote cave in Jaintia Hills.
* The fish has no eyes and is white due to a lack of melanin pigmentation.
* As they live in a nutrient-limited environment most of these species are small.

### 8) Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* The State Government of Arunachal Pradesh intends to build a highway through the 862 sq km Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) in East Kameng district.
* The Government had in the past built a highway through the Namdapha National Park.

#### Key Points

* The project is named the East-West Industrial Corridor which is a proposed elevated corridor at the tiger reserve, to be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs.2,550 crore.
* The highway aims to connect Bhairabhunda in West Kameng district and Myanmar in Changlang district along Arunachal Pradesh’s border with Assam.
* The argument over an elevated corridor at the PTR was that it can ensure the free movement of wild animals.
* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state’s foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.
* The vegetation is predominantly tropical semi-evergreen forest.
* What makes PTR special are the brilliant efforts of the Forest Department and local communities like that of the Nyishi Tribe who inhabit the area around the park to protect the wildlife here.

Scheduled,"My suggestions for dealing deal with depression, low confidence, mental health",59,f8d9y4,gyaani_guy,16,"Keep it short: 

Had extremely extremely high social anxiety, 0 confidence, followed by crippling depression. Ideas like I will never be able to earn money etc. Now: social anxiety is so less, its completely crazy.  Almost gone is several cases.

Realize depression, anxiety WILL go away. You are wrong if you think your anxiety can't go away or you won't be confident. Same with depression, curable. Get this in your head.

Things that actually really worked with me:

1. Sunlight! My psychiatrist told me. 1 hr daily. Direct sunlight on your head, neck areas, ideally within 3 hrs on waking. He also suggested about an option of buying some lights that do the same thing.
2. Sleep schedule is very important !! Cannot be stressed enough. Something I ignored for years! Even now its not perfect. But wake early after 7-8 hrs of sleep. Wake at 6AM, go outside in the morning breeze.
3. Exercise. Strength exercise specifically. At least for me. Its not about muscles. Your body, you, feel different. I didn't know back muscles could be flexed. Don't attempt to rush it though. Make it a medium term plan to become physically stronger. Start slow, stretch, jog, walk. Avoid injuries. took 4-5 months to feel results. 

Confidence is not magic. Nor is depression a mystery. Think scientifically. Human body has evolved for millions of years in a certain environment - with open areas, lot of sunlight, doing hard labour. In the absence of sunlight, living in a cave with a weak body, our body is in unknown waters. Issues are bound to happen imo.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f8d9y4/my_suggestions_for_dealing_deal_with_depression/
Scheduled,(CONFESSION) Kinda Stuck Here,34,f9a1i5,TheFatherofOwls,17,"Alright people, my post might be a bit self-centered with all the chaos and bloodshed that is happening right now in our capital city. But, I really want to share this out here so as to get some good advice, feedback and discussions.

A few months back, I got a job in very nascent startup and been working there as a Graphic Designer. Tbh, I like everything about the role and the job that I get to do here, people appreciate, validate and respect the work that I am doing here - I have no complaints in that regard.

Sure, being a very new startup, there aren't much co-workers around and the very handful there are, are older to me by a generation or so and thus, we have almost little to none in common with each other. I am also the only designer in my department and thus, things tend to get very lonely for me, at times (though, I've been plagued with loneliness for years now). 

But these aren't a dealbreaker for me and aren't the reasons for why I have made this post in the first place.

The dealbreaker for me however, lies in the fact that I am expected to show up to work for all 7 days. 7\*365. Let alone this, I used to be the kind of person who loathed the idea of there being a 6-day working schedule (as one barely gets to do anything in that single day they get on a Sunday).

I mean, this was made clear to me during interview, when I enquired them about the weekends. And I understand, being a part of the food and beverage industry, the company is expected to operate 24\*7\*365, due to the kind of industry that it is part of.

I thought, after not being in a job for the previous year, my self-discipline and schedule went out of control and thought maybe working all 7 days will get back my old discipline as I thought that it will make me ""more active"" and ""less lazy"". 

And, I guess, I've been proved wrong all the while, simultaneously, my doubts have been proved true too, in regards to working all 7 days.

I struggle to get up early now, even despite getting sound sleep and going to bed early (I made a thread about this, a few days back here). I really feel burned out and am struggling to get my tasks done, due to not being able to focus and concentrate properly. I mean, I felt the burn-out in a mere months after I started working.

Again, I understand the kind of industry I am in, what I don't understand however, is why must I, a designer (well, I am a Marketing Analyst to be more precise, if that helps), needs to show up for all 7 days? I understand the production team needing to show up like that as well, F&B industry but even me too? Besides, the production team, most of them, reside nearby in a lodging whereas, it takes me 40-50 minutes to reach my office and home.

I took a day-off today and whatsapped my boss even, telling him that I need this break as I have been struggling to do my tasks for the past few days for which, he understood and granted.

And thus, I am feeling that this job is too much for me, the schedule at least. Which is sad, as I like almost every aspect of this job, being the only designer in my company, I also don't have any managers supervising or micromanaging ( I report to the CEO directly) and thus, I am bestowed with full control in what I get to do.

The timing is also not fixed. Boss seems like the kind of person who knows what he is actually doing and isn't egoistic, petty or tyrannical in any way.

I honestly don't think that I can get such freedom and privilege anywhere else . And that is why it pains me to share this post as despite all this perks, no matter how good and ""ideal"" a work is for someone, ultimately, there needs to be a break where I could have all the personal time that I crave for and where once, just for once, I don't need to wake up everyday with the thought that I need to go to work for that day. 

Sure, during Sunday I could leave for work earlier than usual but, it defeats the point of keeping it in the first place, doesn't it? To only show up for a handful of hours, there is ample time to get whatever work there is left, in the remaining 6 full days.

My fear is also that, if i resign from this job, I don't think that I would get one anywhere else. Seeking for one for three full months prior to landing in this and eclipsing this from my parents (mother especially, as I feel that they tend to give a typical, Boomer-esque advice that doesn't help me at all and only infuriates me further) was already a cruel and painful experience, man. 

I would quit this in a heartbeat if my mother is an understanding and supportive type. Expect, she is very emotionally abusive and neglectful and will never (and has never in the past too) ever, provide me the support that I want (and even deserve maybe). She will at best, be neutral and at worst, be antagonistic towards me (and she's like that too to both my Dad and sibling).

Based on the feedback I get (and deep down personally), I know that I am not a bad designer, if I try and put effort. And yet, I was sucking in all the interviews that I attended prior. Was it because I am a fresher? I don't want to go to the whole ordeal again.

And thus, I feel like I am stuck here. I am sorry for the long post, but wanted to let this out in the hopes that others can hear and understand the predicament I am in, right now.

TL:DR - Graphic Designer (Marketing Analyst, actually) working for almost 3 months now. Satisfied with everything else, though need to show all 7 days in a week due to the industry and thus, is gradually taking a toll on me. Afraid of quitting and finding a new one in the fears that I won't get any, because of being a Fresher no matter how competent I might be. And also in the fears that I won't get the perks and privileges (that I've described in this post) that I am enjoying here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f9a1i5/confession_kinda_stuck_here/

Scheduled,Indigo flight to chandigarh overbooked passengers stranded.,265,ea0iu4,kindasapien,39,"So, flight 6E 592 from Bangalore to Chandigarh Indigo airlines has been overbooked by indigo. These guys came to know about this when boarding bus was at the door of aircraft with 50-70 passengers still in boarding bus. 

We have kept the flight stranded for now.

But such irresponsible behaviour from indigo has left all of us in jiffy. We are standing at tarmac currently.

Will update.

Please upvote this for visibility. These are such malicious practices. How can they have overbooked so much.

Update1: so indigo guys scheduled same flight to two different places instead of two. And passengers for other location (I couldn't get that) have not be allowed to board.
Now they have boarded all the Chandigarh passengers.
But rest are still stranded. I am on board but still there are atleast 30 people stranded. This is some pathetic show by indigo

Also I am not sure whether i will get my luggage today.

Okay will update after I reach Chandigarh airplane mode time. Hope these guys don't remain stranded here for long.

Real shit show by indigo

Update 2: Reached Chandigarh got my luggage.

About the whole fiasco. Seems like those passengers were going to Amritsar and Indigo cancelled their flights and tried to put them on Chandigarh flight and a further passage to Amritsar. Now due to almost complete show by Chandigarh passengers ,Amritsar guys were stopped from boarding.
TLDR: seems like indigo miscalculated the no show and caused stranded passengers
 Edit: https://www.flightstats.com/v2/flight-tracker/6E/592

Since some are doubting this story. Above is flight stats link for the flight. 40min delay was due to this whole drama. Now I am hoping someone comes up with video or news of this.

> Taseer was born in London to politician and businessman Salman Taseer (who was born in British India to a British mother and Indian father, the latter became Pakistani at partition) and Indian journalist Tavleen Singh. His parents never married, he was raised by his mother and had no contact with his father until he was aged 21. He was raised in New Delhi, before attending Kodaikanal International School, a residential school in Kodaikanal.  Taseer later studied at Amherst College  in Massachusetts, earning dual Bachelor of Arts degrees in French and Political Science in 2001.  In his first book Stranger to History (2009), which received many reviews in India, he wrote about his estrangement from his father who was a governor of the Punjab province in Pakistan

> Aatish Taseer became a contributing opinion writer for The International New York Times in the fall of 2015.
> He is the author, most recently, of “The Way Things Were,” which The Los Angeles Review of Books described as “the best Indian novel of the last decade.”
> His other books are “Stranger to History: A Son’s Journey Through Islamic Lands,” a Costa-shortlisted first novel, “The Temple-Goers,” and the highly acclaimed “Noon.” He has written for The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and The Sunday Times, London, among other publications.

> On 8 November 2019, Taseer's Overseas Citizenship of India was revoked by the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs claiming he attempted to ""conceal information that his father was of Pakistani origin"". Taseer has said this is untrue, he never concealed the identity of his father with whom he had no contact and his mother was always he only legal guardian as a minor. Taseer alleged that the ministry didn't give him enough time and that it was an act of reprisal. In his May 2019 cover article for Time magazine, published during the Indian election entitled ""India’s divider in chief"" he was highly critical of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. He told The Guardian that his citizenship issue had not caused him any problems before the Time article was published. The Home ministry rejected the claim that the Time article had any connection to the rejection of Taseer's citizenship.

> Taseer's first book Stranger to History: A Son's Journey Through Islamic Lands (2009), His part memoir-part travelogue, has been translated into more than 14 languages and hailed as a ""must-read"" for anyone attempting to understand the Muslim world. Taseer's well received translation of Saadat Hasan Manto's short stories from the original Urdu, Manto: Selected Stories, was published in 2008.

The AMA is scheduled for 27th December, 9:30 PM IST.

Scheduled,(CONFESSION) In a Dilemma,8,fe9bye,TheFatherofOwls,11,"Alright, this is a follow-up to a post I made a week back regarding me feeling stuck in a job that I really like but also, one that expects me to show up for work all 7 days.

I seem to have trouble giving a link to my first post here as upon posting, I get a message saying that it is awaiting approval. Been trying to do it for a couple of hours and I felt by then, the post would have gotten stale and old to be seen by others, in the feed.

A few days back, while leaving for the day after de-briefing with my boss, he noticed me looking tired than usual (really was dull and tired that day) and told me if there's anything wrong with me. I told him there's nothing wrong but he insisted. Since it's been only 3 months since I joined work, my probation period was coming to an end. I told him that whatever issue that I have, I'll discuss with him during my performance review that would have likely been conducted after the probation got over.

But, he insisted sharing whatever was bothering me and thus, I spilled it out - that a 7 day working schedule is too much for me to handle and that I might not be a fit in this industry (note that I've mentioned ""industry"" and not the ""company"") in the long run (It's a food and beverage industry). I told him a day off in a week is all I expect. For which, he told me that he is fine with me taking a break every week as long as I don't take it on a Sunday, as the production team too, will start demanding days-off.

I guess, it is kinda reasonable but still, I find it odd that there's no day-off by default and that I have to take one from my part. But that's kinda resolved, right? Except this isn't the problem.....

When he inquired me as to what my long-term goals are, I told him (and have told him prior, even on my interview) that my endgame is to become a professor in the field of Humanities or a psychologist. He kinda dismissed that desire of mine and told me flat-out that I am not a ""professor material"" as I am shy, reserved and socially awkward who lacks people skills. He told me that the role that I am in, right now, is what I was made to do due to how good and ""exemplary"" I have been, in these three months it seems.

He broke down in detail and gave (what I feel) was a worst-case estimate as to how my desire won't work out for me and told me that he too was in my place when he was my age - confused and ""lacking a sense of direction"" and told me as to how he earned this place due to sheer hard work and asked me data to back-up my claim of becoming a teacher, when I told him my desire was purely based on intuition (he told me to not ""hide behind such a pretext"").

Honestly, I felt humiliated, insulted and destroyed after the conversation. This is the first time someone is telling me that I am not a professor material. As, based on previous interactions with some of my classmates, friends and even my teachers, almost everyone agreed that I have what it took to become one. But, boss was a highly educated guy who has had tons of XP with life and is sitting in this position out of his sheer hard work and dedication and so, he implied that by not taking his advice, I am losing a great opportunity and going on a path in ruining my life.

I felt so patronized and the entire conversation reeked of condescension, from his part. I literally could not tell anything from my defense and told him that I'll prove him wrong somehow.

Tbh, I never even told that I was planning on quitting....all I said was that the schedule was too much for me and so, I'll give a few more months only after which, I might call ""quits"". He told me to quit asap if that was the case, as he does not wish to invest and spend any further on me as it was go to waste, once I quit and thus, he'll have to find another one and have to start the entire thing from scratch all over again. Which is very understandable and fair, as I never thought about it from that perspective.

Honestly though, I did not know quitting a job will be this emotionally draining and intensive. I thought it would be cold, formal process but no....they patronized, guilt-tripped me and made me feel absolutely terrible and worthless.

He has given me two days time to come to a conclusion and based on what I wrote in my previous post, I am still stumped and at a loss in taking a decision based on the perks and privileges I enjoy here. But the whole interaction has left me with a bad taste in my mouth - no one patronizes me and dictates me into telling what I should be and what I cannot be and insult, mock and belittle my desires and dreams under the pretext of being ""honest, rational and practical"".

Maybe my desires are impractical but, it could have been broken down to me in a better way.

Scheduled,Mental Health Therapy service for NRIs,9,ffwh0m,karna852,7,"Hey Everyone,

**tl;dr – if you are like me, I want to arrange free online therapy for you (with a small catch).**

Big fan of this sub. It's been really great to read news about India and be able to discuss it. 

**About Me**

My name is Prakash. My family is from Kerala and I grew up in Hong Kong. After my primary and secondary school there, I ended up going to the Bay Area for university. After 7 years in the Bay, I moved back to India in order to work (believed that there were interesting things happening in consumer tech).

I’ve also had depression since I was 12, ended up getting hospitalized for it and then spent significant time figuring out how to manage it with a therapist.

What really helped me was moving back to India and being able to talk to a therapist who could understand the specific cultural issues that I was going through. I didn’t have the greatest relationship with my parents and it was sometimes really difficult to get a handle on my more negative thought patterns. My decision to move back to India was also really hard - lots of family members questioning my sanity and a lot of self doubt (am I stupidly just chasing risk?). Finally, I had a lot of insecurity about how I looked because I was usually the only brown person in the rooms I was moving in (and Hong Kong is not the most accepting place for people of colour).

**What I’m trying to do**

After having spent time both abroad and in India, I realized that there weren’t that many therapists abroad that could understand where I was coming from and that my Indian therapist was a lot more effective because of our shared cultural background.

I’m currently trying to see if other people feel this way, so here’s what I’m proposing -

Go to this website [www.talkfreely.uk](https://www.talkfreely.uk/) and sign up.

I’ll reach out to you via email and schedule a weekly online session with a therapist.

For the first 5 weeks, this service will be free, after which it will cost you roughly 20 pounds per hour (or your equivalent local currency).

In return, you and I jump on a short call every week so you can help me iron out the operational kinks. I want to get feedback on what’s effective and what’s not, so that I can make the service better.

**Caveats**

If you’re facing really SERIOUS depression or another serious mental health disorder, DO NOT use this service. You need to get professional help in person.

If you’re in the US, you unfortunately **can’t use** this service because of regulation. If you’re in the UK, Singapore, HK, Dubai…you’re fine. The pricing is set in pounds, but I'm happy to convert to the currency of your choice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffwh0m/mental_health_therapy_service_for_nris/

Scheduled,Either India's property developers are insane or I am.,197,d4jscs,mrfreeze2000,155,"I'm at the age where buying a house is the next thing on my agenda. I've been looking at listings on property websites a lot lately. So consequently, most of the ads I see online on Instagram, Facebook and even Reddit are for properties.

Nothing about these properties or their pricing makes any sense to me whatsoever.

Take a new development by Godrej in Delhi - Godrej South Estates. They've been spamming the shit out of me with their ads. The prices start at ""only"" 2.6cr for. 2 bedroom. For a 4 bedroom apartment, rates start at 6.5-7cr.

They're pushing it as some sort of ultra luxury destination...except its in Okhla, which is an industrial area. I used to have my office in the area and its literally one of the shittiest areas in the entire city. There is a literal trash mountain right next to the development

Not that development has even started yet. They're advertising $1M apartments built near trash heaps witg delivery scheduled around Modi's next term.

The situation in Gurgaon seems to be even more insane. There are apartment complexes built in the middle of nowhere with not a single street light for miles being advertised for crores.

Meanwhile if you wanted an apartment in the already established, well settled areas in DLF Phase 3, you can get them for half the price

Back in my hometown of Jaipur, apartments rates are equally out of whack. You can pay 1cr for an apartment in Vaishali Nagar...or you can buy a piece of land 100 meters away from the apartment and built a little mansion of your own for less than 1cr

My brain is not really able to compute any of this. 5cr apartments that are not even 50% ready built in the middle of nowhere? Who is buying them? More importantly, why are they buying them?

At this point, I feel that I will keep renting all my life. Not because I can't afford a house, but because nothing about the Indian property market seems rational to me. I make very substantial money but I refuse to participate in this utter irrationality

Scheduled,Most effective way to deal with Indian clients.,19,es75b5,vivek_david_law,11,"Hi there.

I was hoping to trouble you for advice about how to deal Indian clients.

I'm a Sri Lankan criminal lawyer practicing in Canada.  My office is in an area with a large number of immigrants from South East Asia.

I don't want to generalize, but I've had some issues with Indian and Pakistani clients.  For one, despite being in an area with many Indian and Pakistani client, I've only retained very few Indian and Pakistani clients.

Despite only being retained by very few Indian clients,  I get a lot of calls and even visits from Indian individuals.  These people often try and take up as much time as possible and ask loads of questions but will refuse to sign up or pay for anything.  Because they're a large community in my area, they actually interfere with my practice by taking and energy time away from paying customers.   After many such visits, I've began to realize that they were only after free advice and not interested in buying anything.

Of course people of other races call for free advice from time to time as well.  But they are in 99% of cases honest about it, and polite about not taking up too much of my time.  Unfortunately the opposite is true for nearly 90% of Indian callers.

Also, I noticed that the few Indian customers I do get are demanding and not very good at keeping up with payment.

Of course this hasn't been the case with all Indian clients, some have been absolutely stellar.  However, it has been the case with way too many of them to the point where I realized I need a better strategy to deal with  it.  Of course, this only seems to apply to people who have immigrated from India or Pakistan relatively recently or people who haven't really integrated well to Canadian culture.  Indians who have integrated to Canadian culture are a joy to work with.  And because at least one person is bound to say it - yes I understand generalizations, not all Indians etc etc.

I realize this sounds like a rant  but it's not.  The reason I'm here is because I realized that there must be some of you who run service oriented businesses in India.   If I'm getting a disproportionate amount of this behavior from Indian clients, Indian businesses must get it alot from their clients.  My question is how do you deal with it?  How do you run an effective business under these conditions?

Do businesses in India have a method for spotting and  weeding out individuals who are looking for free advice and just wasting your time?   Do businesses in india have a strategy for dealing with difficult or demanding clients.   What strategies to Indian businesses employ to make sure payment schedule are met on time.   And finally, I'm starting to suspect that the main way to get Indian clients is through referrals through someone they know, is this suspicion accurate or is there another way to market effectively to Indian clients.

Basically what's the best way for a business owner to serve Indian clients without losing his mind?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/es75b5/most_effective_way_to_deal_with_indian_clients/

I'll be reaching Goa on Friday afternoon.

2. Would love to talk about life experiences and books you've read. 

3. Love hikes and walks on sunset beaches.

Scheduled,[Scheduled]The population debate: The depopulation phase of India and it's impact of the economy,53,56bi87,miguel-styx,50,"Here's a question:
We know through stats that around 2050-60, the population the country will fall down, and with an estimated 2-digit trillion economy, we will see the rise of the GDP per capita.

This is all WITH the current TFR (It is at a replacement rate). Now we change some data shall we? The goverment decides that from tomorrow, would apply mandatory childless policies. It's illegal to procreate and people would need to adopt children if they want to be, you know, parents. Amazing! Orphans would get new homes and they are really happy (Let us assume, they law is perfectly enforced).

The TFR would fall down below the replacement rate, ensuring population WILL fall down. However, there's this problem: We have a lot old people, and the thing is *they can't work*. Especially a country like India, where there is huge population and on top of that: *a huge old population*. How are we going to give them pensions? Government would *spend* more than *gain* more? An old poor population isn't a very good incentive for FDI either. How are we going to tackle the massive grey population we have?

Scheduled,Qnet...Dnt tell I didn't tell you,121,dhn5is,masoomdon,43,"Some of us might have heard of Qnet and for those who haven't this thread is for you guys

This actually happened like a year ago and I had totally forgotten about it till someone pitched me Qnet again a few days ago.

Back in 2018, I had quit my cushy job and just about started my own startup - so money was tight, I was highly motivated and looking to jump at any opportunity and this is when a guy I used to work with messaged me and told me he had this insane opportunity for me. He said it was a limited-time opportunity and he was recommending me to his mentors - this is where I started feeling like this is an MLM pitch or some sort of scam but given that I had always known him to be an honest fellow I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

He scheduled a meet with some senior and this was in Sheraton, Delhi. So, first I meet this lady who says she's been working with this eCommerce/ networking company for past 2-3 years and here is the gist of the talk I had with her

1. She earns lakhs by working only a few weeks of the month, travels the world when she fancies, blah blah stuff like that.
2. I heard more irrelevant business jargons in 45 mins from her than I did in my 2 years of b-school.
3. Tried to discuss on a few of the business jargons she had been throwing around and I realised she only knows the terms and not what they mean.
4. So in 45 mins, I hear everything from her own success story to random stuff, but not a single word of what the opportunity is about or what the revenue model is - only that the more hours I put in, the more money I make and the returns are like 500%.
5. She says she liked my personality, motivation and whatnot and would let me know if I qualified for the program. Then she goes on for 10-15 minutes to say how CEOs, VPs, etc. are lining up for this opportunity and even shows me her contact list saying all these people have been after her life so that she lets me in on this once in a lifetime opportunity. By now I had figured out this was some good scam and cursing myself for taking an uber instead of taking the metro. Shes like she will recommend me but chances are 50-50.
6. Guess what? 10 minutes later, a very senior person in the business happens to be coming to this very hotel and that she can arrange for me to meet with him now only and all I had to do was impress him.

Part 2: Meeting the so-called bigshot

1. So I had earlier talked about my love for travelling and building my own business in marketing. So, the guy tells me that he has travelled over 50 countries last year and the lakhs of rupees he makes from this business helped him to secure his own passion project.
2. Apparently he was earning 5 lakhs per month in the IT industry before quitting his job. But despite me repeatedly asking he did not tell me which company he used to work for or even what role he was working in.
3. By now, I am just enjoying my snacks and trying to see how far these scammers will go to sell me whatever it is they are trying to sell.
4. The guy also realised his sales pitch was not working and so he tried to convince me that I was morally responsible for my parents having to work in their old age when I should be able to provide for them and this opportunity was the only way I was going to do that
5. I repeatedly asked him what organization I would be working for and he evaded the question every single time. The only thing he said was that **Microsoft** handles their paperwork and hence, they are a trustworthy company.
6. At the very end, he casually mentions that fees for xyz stuff are **INR 1,70,000** and that I would be making that back in the next few weeks only.

Thanked him, finished my snacks and said I would think about it. I very nearly wanted to go full ballistic and let him know what a load of bs he had been going on about.

Also, they did ask for my PAN CARD photo which I said I didn't have on me and said I will send it once I get back, which I never did.

As for the guy who got me into this entire waste of time, I see him post motivational posts on social media daily, post pics of trips to exotic places and him riding inexpensive cars. He did try to pressure me into paying up the money and all he said was that the company name was QNET and nothing about what they did. A quick google search was enough to verify my doubts.

Scheduled,My recent experience with a NEXA dealership.,40,eihedp,seeyoulateraligator,16,"TLDR: Don’t take the word of a car dealership/service station at its face value. Do your due diligence, ask around  before committing to any off the schedule repair/maintenance. 

So about 3 weeks back, I borrowed a near new condition Ignis (about 2.5 year old and less than 15k kms) from a cousin and drove to about 130kms to a town nearby for some urgent family matter. 

15 mins into the drive, the steering felt a bit strange and I stopped over to check. Upon inspection of the tires and the engine bay, everything seemed ok. But thought I’d get the wheels balanced and aligned once I reach my destination. So I refilled the tires with correct air pressure (which was off a bit) and went on my way.

Drive to the destination was fine and mostly highway driving. Upon reaching my destination I noticed that the car’s front tire assembly would make a funny sound on sharp turnings, as I was parking it. Opened up the hood and saw a lot of grease/oil smeared near the passenger cv shaft ( the rod that connects the engine to the tire and drives it). I immediately knew that the CV boot ( rubber cover around a bearing) had busted and had spilled all its grease. 

But just to be sure and since this was not my car, I took it straight to the Nexa showroom, while I also calling the owner of the car. The Nexa showroom people pointed me to the their service station, which thankfully wasn’t that far. Nobody at the showroom bothered to come see the car and see if it was even drivable (or safe to drive). But I can understand since this was just a sales showroom.

Upon reaching the service centre the foreman inspects the car and says that the whole cv shaft is broken and would need a replacement. I asked if he was 100% sure and asked to see the owner for confirmation. The owner repeats the same and they quote me Rs 7000 (plus labour) for the fix and ask me to leave the car there for a few days as they would need to order the part. I asked them to provide me with a inspection/quotation paper. Which they did. I then tell them that according to my experience and knowledge only the cv boot needs replacement. They totally dismissed my input. By this time I had already removed the car from their service station and parked it outside. 

I then call my cousin and explain the whole situation in front of the service station owner and the foreman. I tell him what the Nexa service people think was the problem and the price and time associated with the fix. He then asks me what my opinion was, and I tell him that that the CV shaft in my opinion was ok and only the boot/rubber cover needs replacement and refilling with grease. Since the wheel still had power and the CV shaft was intact in one piece, and the reason for the sound was no/low grease around the cv bearing. I tell him that I knew that the CV shaft was fine and only the boot/rubber covering was broken since about 4 years ago I had personally replaced the whole CV shaft on my own car (common issue on older cars) and know about these issues.

After hearing this, the owner leaves and the foreman asks me to sign the quotation/service form which now states that they couldn’t repair the car because of “unavailability of part”. 

After that, I go to a car repair market nearby and consult with the mechanic there. Who confirms my diagnosis. And after confirming with my cousins, he fixes it within 1.5 hours for a total of Rs 700. The car drives fine, no problems since. 

Knowing that this was not my car, I would have happily paid more that Rs 700 if Nexa service people were willing to replace the cv boot. Maybe just maybe they don’t replace the cv boot, period. But at least they could have been honest with me and not miss diagnosed the issue. I never trusted car dealerships and their service stations, this just added to the list.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eihedp/my_recent_experience_with_a_nexa_dealership/

On 12 January 2018, four senior judges of the Supreme Court; [Jasti Chelameswar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasti_Chelameswar), [Ranjan Gogoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranjan_Gogoi), [Madan Lokur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madan_Lokur) and [Kurian Joseph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurian_Joseph) addressed a press conference criticising Misra's style of administration and allocation of cases. However, people close to Misra refuted these allegations.[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipak_Misra#cite_note-27)[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipak_Misra#cite_note-28)[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipak_Misra#cite_note-29)  \[I think everyone know about this quite well, So I won't elaborate\]

Then there's Ranjan Gogoi: I wrote elaborately about him:  [Justice Ranjan Gogoi: The Worst Chief Justice of India (I've ever seen)](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/exexa4/justice_ranjan_gogoi_the_worst_chief_justice_of/)

I'm not directly blaming BJP over this \[contrary to the title\].

But let's take a look:

1. Jagdish Singh Khehar's case related to the death of  K Pul.
2. Dipak Mishra: K Pul case &  Bribery case.
3. Ranjan Gogoi : Sexual harassment case.

In all 3 cases, BJP Govt came heavily in support of these judges.

Did it make these judges to incline towards BJP?

Had there been proper protocols to deal with such incidents, which upholds the integrity of SC, wouldn't it be better?

Scheduled,Are the students of Jamia Millia Islamia really interested in secularism? Evidence points to the contrary.,0,ee2yz1,rahularyarrg,23,"Over the past week or so, we have seen violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) across many states. The one that was probably reported the most was the protest by Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) students. News channels like NDTV and India Today repeatedly reported how the police used excessive force against “peaceful” protesters. We were told that the students were opposed to the omission of Muslims from the CAA and sought to fight against it to “save” Indian democracy and “secularism”.

&#x200B;

While going through posts on social media, I came across an interesting piece of information - that JMI reserved 50% of its seats for Muslims. Not having too much faith in the accuracy of social media posts, I wanted to verify if this was really the case. Because if it were, it would clearly show that JMI was anything but secular. And so I started to go through their official websites: www.jmi.ac.in and www.jmicoe.in. What I learnt during my research astounded me. I knew that Muslim institutions gave preferential treatment to Muslims over non-Muslims but I never expected it to be this bad. My article relies solely on the documents and information available on these two official websites. No third parties, no hearsay. All the sources and links are listed at the end of this article.

  
To begin with, the claim that 50% seats in JMI are reserved for Muslims is absolutely true. The following text has been taken from Page 30 of the 2018-19 prospectus of JMI. (as can be seen in the attached image)

  
5.1  
(i) 30% of the total number of seats in each Program shall be earmarked for Muslim applicants.  
(ii) 10% of the total number of seats in each Program shall be earmarked for Women applicants who are Muslims.  
(iii) 10% of the total number of seats in each Program shall be earmarked for “Other Backward Classes” (OBCs) and Scheduled Tribes who are Muslims.  
Note: If seats remain vacant in any program from amongst the 10% of the total number of seats earmarked as per 5.1 (ii) and (iii) above, such vacant seats shall stand transferred to the category 5.1(i),i.e., Muslim applicants.

  
In other words, 30% seats for Muslim applicants + 10% for Muslim women + 10% for Muslim OBC. If there are any vacant seats from the Muslim women or Muslim OBC category, then those seats would be transferred to other Muslim applicants. So there would AT LEAST 50% seats for Muslims in JMI. Why do I say at least 50%? Well, apart from the 50% reservation for Muslims, there’s 5% reservation for Persons with Disabilities (or PwD). This reservation for PwDs is not limited Muslims only but since the selection of students would be done by the JMI staff, they could opt for Muslims over PwDs from other religions. And on top of that, there’s 5% reservation for “Internal (Jamia) students” i.e. students of Jamia who have passed their qualifying examination (X or XII) from Jamia Schools. And given that the same 50% reservation policy for Muslims exists in Jamia schools, the students from this category could all be Muslims. So on the whole, there could be up to a maximum of 60% Muslims from the reserved categories.

  
But wait, it gets a lot worse!! There could be far more than 60% Muslims in a program / course. How? Because Muslims can also get admissions in the General category !!! In other words, 50% seats are reserved for Muslims only i.e. only Muslims can opt for these seats. Of the 5% reserved seats for PwDs, Muslims can be given preference. And 5% reservation for internal jamia students would almost certainly be all Muslims. On top of that, there would be Muslim applicants in the General category i.e. Muslims students who opt for admissions not via reservation but in the general category. So in the end, the percentage of Muslim students could be way more than 60%.

  
To find out the exact proportion of Muslim students, one would require the list of all admissions in a particular program / course. I did find the list of all admissions for the year 2019-20 but since those lists display only the registration number of the students and not their name and religion, it cannot be used to determine the exact number of Muslim students. However I did find the list of graduated students for the year 2018. This list mentions the name of the candidates in addition to the registration number. Here’s what I found:

  
a. In B.Tech Computer Engineering, 37 of the 62 graduates are Muslims i.e. 59%.  
b. In B.Tech Electronics and Communication Engineering, 40 of the 62 graduates are Muslims i.e. 64%.  
c. In B.Tech Mechanical Engineering, 43 of the 65 graduates are Muslims i.e. 66%.  
d. In B.Tech Civil Engineering, 51 of the 65 graduates are Muslims i.e. 78%.

  
Assuming that the proportion of students in admission and graduation would be more-or-less the same, this data not only confirmed my suspicions that the percentage of Muslim students in various courses would be least 60% but went on to show that it may be as high as 80%. I analysed the data for these four streams of engineering. There are several other courses but I did not spend my time analysing each and every single one. For those who are interested to dig deeper, relevant links can be found at the end of this article. 

  
I then looked into scholarships i.e. what percentage of the total number of students who received scholarships were Muslims. Alumni Association of Jamia Millia Islamia (AAJMI) is tasked with providing scholarships for JMI students. I found the list of the selected candidates for the current year.

  
In the first list, out of the 325 selected candidates, 303 are Muslims; which is 93% !!  And in the second list, 96 out of the 99 candidates are Muslims i.e. 97%. In other words, of all the students who received scholarship in 2019, approximately 95% were Muslims.

  
This data conclusively proves that an overwhelming majority of students at JMI are Muslims and that Muslims are given preferential treatment. I wondered if the same pattern holds true for the positions of deans and Heads of Department (HODs). And predictably enough, JMI does not disappoint !!

  
Of the 37 heads of various departments, 32 are Muslim i.e. 86%. And when it comes to the Deans of faculties, 8 of the 9 are Muslim = 89% !! (Annual Report 2017-18)

  
Finally, I went through the list of Chancellors and Vice-Chancellors of JMI. By now, I’m sure you can guess what I would have found. Of the 11 Chancellors since 1920, not one is a non-Muslim. And the same holds true for VCs. Not one of the 15 Vice Chancellors since 1920 is a non-Muslim.

  
So in the end, *60-80% of the students, 95% of scholarship recipients, 86% of the HODs, approximately 90% of the Deans of faculties*, and all the past & present Chancellors & Vice Chancellors of JMI are Muslims !! And yet, they claim to fight for ""secularism"" !!!

  
Ask yourself these simple questions:  
1. How serious can the students of such a university be about “secularism”?  
2. Should we as a nation pay any heed to their demands given their shameless hypocrisy?  
3. If they indeed were such strong believers in the idea of secularism then wouldn’t they start by secularising their own university first?  
4. Do the students and professors of this university have a moral right to oppose ANY act on the grounds of secularism?

  
For any unbiased reader, this article conclusively proves that the JMI is not interested in secularism in the least. Then why are they protesting CAA? In my opinion, the reasons are:  
1. Supreme Court’s decision in favour of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya.  
2. Belief that Muslims must be loyal to fellow Muslims over the country i.e. Muslim Ummah (or Ummat).  
3. Rightly / wrongly concluding that NRC will be bad.

  
It is also very interesting how leftists / liberals and Muslims have learnt the subtle art of appropriating the Constitution to suit their own agenda. Everybody has heard the accusation that the CAA violates Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. One can find many Muslims, and non-Muslims, repeating the same crap. It is however very interesting that Muslims are demanding equality and cite Article 14 as the justification. Well, if they are so bent upon equality, then why don’t they accept the demand for Universal Civil Code (UCC)? NO!! You see, when the debate is about UCC, they quote Article 25 of the Constitution which gives the right to practice one’s own religion and claim various special privileges as a religious right; for eg. four wives, triple talaq, etc. And when the discussion pertains to giving citizenship to non-Muslim minorities from neighbouring Islamic countries, they jump to Article 14 !! In other words, they pick and choose that which suits them.

  
So the next time you meet a leftist/liberal or Muslim who says that they oppose CAA because it goes against Article 14 and the principle of equal treatment, ask him if he supports Universal Civil Code. If he denies or gives you a lengthy nonsensical answer as to why he opposes UCC, then he stands exposed ; proving that he / she is not really interested in secularism. 

  
It is amazing that channels like NDTV who claim to present facts as they are have never seen fit to inform Indians about the vastly disproportionate number of Muslim students in JMI. Nor do they call out the hypocrisy of JMI “students”. If they would have, the whole country would have learnt that these protests have nothing to do with “secularism”.

  
Now it is up to us to spread the word. Please share / forward this article so that the truth about JMI is known to everyone.

Scheduled,February Goals >>>>>>>>,3,f2x27b,dxb23CA,4,"February Goals

It's been a little late for me to make resolutions for this year but we live in present and not past.

I think we all have the ability and audacity to think good and even exceptional things for ourselves. And I've learnt two things in life till now: whatever your goals are, let people know about it. It does two things: Firstly, people around you will help out and the secondly it will make you committed / liable.

So here it is:

Since I'm into public accounting and auditing, I've set a goal for myself to work with one of the big4 (**Deloitte, EY, PWC and KPMG**) in second half of 2020. 

For me it's a big deal to be a part of multinational and reputed accounting firms around the world. And I think it also serves a justice to my degrees as well.

So I've mapped out a plan which will help me in achievement of my goal. 

1. Everyday I would try to connect and speak with at least 1 recruiter and 3 people who are/were associate with those companies.
2. I will have my CV made from someone professional and experienced in this industry.
3. I will attend as many as networking events as possible and recite the same thing again to every person I come across in the hope of getting a connection somehow.
4. Try to schedule informational interviews if that's a thing in Dubai.
5. Make a professional video about my profile and upload it over social media.
6. Even I'll go one step further, upload all those networking and informational interviews videos on Youtube.
7. Maybe even run my Facebook and instagram ads against people who work in these organizations.
8. Last but not the least, prepare for that final day, EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY.

Now that would be it from my side and I'll leave out rest things on LUCK. 

Three things gonna happen from this post:

1. No-one responds (which is intact even worse) and I'll get on to my to-do list and check off every item listed above.
2. Someone who actually care about helping others and either work in these organisations or know someone there who can make things move would reach out to me.
3. And last one would be ones who will rant about everything.

Or just help me out on how to meet people and network with people over here in this part of the world? Coz I really want this thing man.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f2x27b/february_goals/

Scheduled,"The true purpose of reservations in India is not economic upliftment, but social inclusion.",131,d6vb4b,conqueror_of_destiny,54," ***For the record, I am a Brahmin (I don't see myself as one. It is merely the word that I use when I fill out any Government form that asks me the question) and I have, in no way, benefited from reservations or affirmative action.***

Reservations in India is a fraught topic and tends to divide people like no other topic does. The vast majority of the upper castes blame reservations for India's inefficient Governance and subsequent lack of opportunities. Many others think it is meant to provide economic upliftment to the so-called depressed classes who have been at the receiving end of the caste pyramid for centuries. Others describe it as a necessary evil that does more good than harm. I take objection to this description of reservation as a ""*necessary evil*"" and as a means of economic upliftment. It is not evil and it is necessary. It does not seek to economically uplift the depressed classes. I will now demonstrate why.

Reservations for the depressed classes (scheduled castes or scheduled tribes and so on and so forth) have been a feature of politics, education and employment opportunities in Independent India. The policy aims to reserve a portion of seats in educational institutions, employment opportunities in Government run organisations and in electoral constituencies for those candidates who are identified to be part of the above mentioned communities. These communities have historically been marginalised and have been downtrodden for millennia. In the case of the Scheduled Tribes (or STs), their predilection to residing in the forests and the remote hinterlands of the Indian sub continent has ensured that they remained outside the purview of mainstream society and thus bereft of the opportunities that are provided by being part of the villages and cities and so on. The tribes of India are for the most part, hunter gatherers living in the remote jungle (such as the Bhils, Gonds and Santhals), or nomadic herders in nature, living with their livestock and migrating from one place to another in search of pasture (such as the Gujjars in some states, though their status as an ST is debatable). Many of these tribes lived only on the margins of human settlements in India and were viewed with hostility and suspicion by most people. The British criminalised many of them by instituting an act called the Criminal Tribes act. Entire communities were criminalised and those who were on the margins of society were further outcast. These communities neither had a say nor were given any kind of justice when their resources (such as forest produce, or land that has historically belonged to them) were extracted (or plundered, if you think that way) by the Government of India in the name of the People of India. Their woman and children have been exploited when they venture out of their remote domains. They have forever been on the margins of society, physically and socially, and have had no voice in the debates of modern India, a country that now counts them as its citizens.

The Scheduled Castes (or SCs) have been treated worse. These communities were classified as social outcasts and were often forced to live outside the village. They weren't allowed to draw water from the same well as the rest of the village, they weren't allowed to visit the temple or take part in the communal activities such as festivals or decision making. They provided an important source of agricultural labour in villages (and still do) and performed menial jobs in the cities that were ritually considered impure or dirty. The agricultural economy would collapse if their labour was not available and sanitation would have been non-existent in the cities without the *Dalits* to clean the toilets and clear the corpses. And yet, they were not part of the conversation when it came to society. They have never had a voice, a say in the decisions that are made when the community gets together and makes a collective decision. They have been exploited physically, economically, and socially by all and sundry. Their status has been little better than slaves. They are an important part of Indian society but have little to no say in the affairs of the country or the state, and yet they are counted as citizens of India.

Why am I telling you so much about how these communities have been excluded over thousands of years? Because reservation is not a policy that primarily seeks to economically uplift communities and give them education and jobs. The purpose of reservation is not economic upliftment but ***social inclusion*** within the mainstream of society, in effect giving them a say in governance and a voice in society. Reservation aims to bring these communities into the social mainstream so that they become part of the conversation and are able to participate fully in society (In politics, in our educational institutions, in employment, in decision making capacities and so on). Without affirmative action policies such as reservation, these communities will forever be marginalised on the outskirts of society. They will be denied a voice and denied opportunities to advance, and denied the right to be treated with dignity as Humans. The harm done to these communities by centuries of prejudice has hardly begun to be redressed by the policies of Independent India. 

It is highly unfortunate that the original purpose of reservation has been warped in such a manner that all and sundry (I am looking at the OBCs and those who advocate reservations for economically weaker sections among the upper castes now) are demanding reservations. Reservation is not about economic opportunity. It is about social justice, and economic opportunity is a by product of social opportunity. Until such a time arrives when these communities are afforded the same social opportunities as the rest of society and are not excluded, reservations are a necessity in India. It is ***not*** a necessary evil. It is ***not*** an evil at all. It is justice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d6vb4b/the_true_purpose_of_reservations_in_india_is_not/

Their online chat will not be available for next 2 hours that's US chat service, don't really know if they can solve my Prometric India issue. I see my cancelled date being available to book. But their online services require us to make payment over phone. I want to take the test on 31st. Is there a way for me to make the payment for rescheduling now. Stuck in the weekend what to do now pickle.

Q. How do I get in touch with Prometric to pay the rescheduling fee, in order to book an appointment for Monday 31/12/2018?

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance. 

PS : this test has been larger than life for me over the past year. Any help will mean a lot to me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aalc9g/need_help_with_scheduling_test_with_prometric/

Though I've multiple concerns at this point, it would be great if anyone can share their experience with the hospital. Particularly, we are interested in understanding the a) staff behavior at the hospital (think giving attention to the patient, quick response time for emergencies etc.), b) facilities and infrastructure, c) cleanliness and associated safety norms, and d) fairness in pricing. 

India's medical sector is very difficult to understand and navigate through, and ours is not a family with many 'contacts' in Mumbai or otherwise. So any kind of information will be appreciated.

Scheduled,Crimes in Delhi,53,dikkb9,ItsSuplexCity,24,"Hi guys,

I am sorry if this post doesn't belong here or If it sounds like a rant but just 2 days back, I just came to know that my cousin's dad was attacked brutally by 2-3 goons in Dwarka at night when he was returning from work on his bicycle. He got off the metro at around 12am at night and was on his way home when he was stopped and beaten mercilessly. The goons didn't rob him and stopped only when they saw a PCR van approaching.

He is in the hospital now and had multiple scans done and is now scheduled for jaw surgery. This is truly heartbreaking for me as their family is really nice. They are a family of three, all of them highly educated, hardworking  and soft spoken people. He returns late from work everyday and rides his bike from the metro station to home even though he has a car just to stay fit while also reduce carbon emissions from his side.

The police doesn't seem to be helping much and are treating it as ""just another everyday case"", like this is normal and expected at Delhi streets. And ofcourse I expect nothing ever to happen to the people who did this, and I am pretty sure they wont get caught.

Just wanted to put this out there, stay safe people and care for your loved ones, you never know what could can happen on the streets of New Delhi.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dikkb9/crimes_in_delhi/
Scheduled,DO and DONT of flight travel ( Due to increase in flight anxiety threads and for future if anyone wants reference),22,dsirfe,heteretes,18,"Mods kindly make a thread for it. Copy paste this content if you like. Flights are a bit of serious business and I can understand why youngsters might feel incredibly anxious 

Some important things to keep in mind first - 

1. Your flight ticket has to be shown to security outside and check in counter. It can be printed as well as shown from mobile ( Avoid taking screenshot of website from where you confirmed your ticket. Take the PDF/JPG which you get via mail from the site. )

2. All domestic flights have a STRICT 45 min closure of check in before their scheduled departure. So make sure that you reach AT LEAST 1.5 hours before your flight. In case you are reaching 1 hour before ( hurt shy of 15 mins for check in closure), kindly INFORM the personnel there that your flight is of that time. Often, they will start to call you themselves by saying FLIGHT TO XYZ area, anyone there. But to be on safe side, do ask personnel there.

3. Airports are supposed to be one of the best and most organized places of any city. So you can expect that there will be proper signboards to guide you.


DO- 1. Keep your power bank inside your handbag and your other stuff like knives,scissors,liquid greater than 100ml inside the check in baggage. 

2. Keep.your power bank, chargers, laptop in your hand baggage. 

3. General weight limit for domestic is 15 kg in check in and 7 in Hand baggage. 

4. In any doubt, ASK the personnel at airport, especially the airline you have booked. Like if you have booked Air India or something, ASK them any doubt. Remember, they are there to help you only.



DONT - 1. DO NOT PANIC during security check. It is simple. You need to keep your belts, chargers, wallets, watch, mobile and laptops etc in one tray and your bag in other tray. Don't worry, the army personnel there just look scary. They are, in fact, VERY helpful. 

2. Ok this is a common mistake women do. Your bags are Pandora boxes. Often you women go in security check and VOILA, you have scissors, knives ( MULTIPLE) and 2-3 bottles coming out of your bag. Remember all those items are broken there as they can't be taken in flight and you can't do anything for sharp objects. And you have to discard liquid if your bottle is filled and js more than 100ml. So kindly CHECK YOUR HAND BAGS BEFORE LEAVING FOR AIRPORT. 

3. DO NOT abuse the airline members for any delays which are not their fault. Remember they are mostly doing everything they can to solve your problem. And if they can't, chances are you were the reason ( Like you coming 40 mins before flight and check in is closed.) Don't be the guy who screams - I KNOW YOUR MANAGER/MAALIK/OWNER/DAD etc. 

4. DO NOT worry that you will crash lol. Many people who are travelling for first time may be scared. I don't blame them as flight crashes are always big news.

However rest assured because the chances that you will get into a car accident is HIGHER compared to you getting in flight accident. Seriously. It is THAT safe.

If I remember more stuff, I will mention it here. Others also please combine and add stuff which I may have forgotten. I am a busy man",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dsirfe/do_and_dont_of_flight_travel_due_to_increase_in/

I know it's been a long time I haven't updated what happened thereafter because I got really busy with them. It wasn't easy raising them, they are just like human babies. 

**The journey until the weaning process:**

Soon after making the post in the afternoon I went to a pet store and got Royal Canin (RC) Babydog milk. The making of the milk was very easy, you just have to add warm water and mix according to the label. it comes with feeding bottle and different nipples for cats as well as for dogs. You can use little more or less powder according to your preference, depending how well the puppies are able to tolerate. It had a very bad smell, so bad that I had to wear some masks whenever I used to feed them lol. After few days I got adjusted to the smell. 

also we found out that the babies are only 1 weeks old, their mom died on the night before we took them home.

Don't forget he milk: There's two options that are generally available in pet stores. One is RC Babydog milk and another one is from Beapher Lactol which doesn't come in large packs, overall RC is cheaper (still costly)

Bedding: For bedding we used a hot bag in the lower portion of a carton (big amazon boxes), then some clothing, bed sheet on top of it and newspapers on top of all of them. Basically created a layer so they don't feel the hot bag but continue to get a warm environment. The temperature is extremely crucial to newborn babies as they aren't able to generate or regulate temperature on their own, they rely on their mother for it. The temperature shouldn't be too much or too low, place your hand on the top of bedding if the heat is tolerable only then place them on top of that else just add some little less hot water next time or put some more clothing in the box. Too much warmth can lead to hotspots, blisters on their skin. 

You have to keep in mind their feeding timeline too. For newborns according to breed size (pariah dogs are medium breeds) you have to feed them 8 times in 24 hours. Again you can break them in even more smaller batches. I used to feed them every 1 or 2 hours apart. Gradually increase the gap when they grow up. Don't feed them too much as that may lead to diarrhea. [Here's a chart printed on Royal Canin's Babydog milk.]

When it comes to toilet they don't urinate on their own. You have to take a cotton boll, dip in lukewarm water and stimulate their genitalia to make them urinate. For potty there's no option so keep them over newspaper and replace them when you see them doing potty. The potty is watery because well all  they are just drinking is milk. If you see them covered up in potty just take some cotton balls and clean them with lukewarm water. 

Take care of mosquitoes too, I used to keep some mosquito coils, or good knight burning all the time. 

All was going well until I ran out of RC Babydog milk, I couldn't find it in local pet stores. So I ordered online from Amazon. Was getting good deal on 2kg pack. Sadly it could arrive two days later. 

I contacted some vet and they said to give them amul spray. I didn't like this plan as cow milk has good amount of lactose which is bad for dogs. Seeing no option I had to give them the amul spray by mixing in water. 

It went fine for two days, no digestion issues popped up. Meanwhile the RC milk arrived, this is where comes the saddest part of raising them. 

None of them were able to tolerate the RC milk for some reason, they instantly vomited. Being a noob we continued to give them the RC milk. Three went back to normal ish but one didn't recover. We contacted another vet who told me it's probably because of sudden diet change. They have extremely sensitive stomach and any sudden change would screw them up. The amul spray we used to give had more lactose content which probably made their stomach bad with the lactose content that is why maybe they weren't able to tolerate the RC milk later. Vet told us to give less amount of powder in more water.

Few days later the dog which was affected worse died. :( 

This incident took a toll on other dogs too, they used to vomit a lot after eating. We couldn't find why but came to conclusion it's probably because they used to drink milk in a hurry. So we made some changes in feeding timeline and went with small batches inbetween so that they don't become very hungry. 

**The weaning process:**

1 month later I started the weaning process with Royal Canin Starter as suggested by vet. I tried first by giving them as it is but nope, they would smell  but wouldn't eat. Then I actually read instructions. :p

According to instructions I soaked them in lukewarm water, wait until the pellets become soft then mash them and make a porridge. It also had a very bad smell but tolerable. The smell is extremely important because that's what makes it attractive to them. They would just gobble up their food. I used to give it 5 times a day. Morning at 7am - 10am - 12pm - 6pm - 9pm. 

Yes you can give them rice, daal at this point but some won't like it. It's easier to feed them ""mashed pellets turned into a porridge"". If RC is costly for you Pedigree has same starter food. 

**The worst part of weaning process, the nightmares:** 

After few weeks later they weren't eating the porridge. Again being a noob I didn't understand that it's time to give them solid food because their teeth has grown. Also maybe they just got bored. 

I bought Pedigree starter and made same porridge. This time they ate like they used to before but again some days later they lost interest. That's when I found out it's time for them to eat solid foods. Also found out I'm supposed to give them Royal Canin Medium/Maxi Starter and not Mini. Yes these brands have created different products based on size of breeds. Confusing af. 

So anyway I got the Maxi starter, they used to eat but again stopped eating. This caused me nightmares and I had sleepless nights thinking why they aren't eating. 

Now Royal Canin was getting really costly as they grew up so I tried Pedigree Pro Starter. They liked it a lot but after some day same result, they won't eat. I tried many brands like Purina, Hill's and same result on everything. Luckily they found cheap Pedigree milk and chicken tasty and business as usual. But another problem started up, some used to vomit after eating. Again we found the culprit was eating too fast and drinking a lot of water after eating which is normal in pellet diet. 

After 1 month In between of those pellets and vomiting we tried rice, daal which they didn't like at first, but they absolutely loved rice+curd (amul masti dahi), then as they grew up we started giving them veggies, eggs which also they loved. 

The schedule was: veggies like potato, carrot, pumpkin in the morning. Curd rice at lunch and daal, roti at night. Eggs once a day. Our family has turned completely vegetarian so no nonveg like meat. I know it's foolish, I do give them Pedigree once in a while and eggs. The diet is still the same till date. Dogs are actually omnivorous unlike cats.

**Poops, urine everywhere..**

You'll see them finding their own spot for urinating and pooping, it's extremely crucial to train them else you'll have to deal with poops on floor and urines. Watch some videos on how to potty train, or better hire a trainer. We didn't do any of that in time and as a consequence mine poops everywhere. Still untill they get trained you have to deal with the poops. Better get cheap toilet paper rolls from Amazon, Bigbasket. Buy their own brand like Presto, Solimo and bbhome. To clean the urines get a scotch brite jumper spin mop and some microfiber clothes as they soak more water. Also keep lizol, dettol handy to clean the floor after each poop.

**The de-worming process.**

You have to deworm them periodically before the first vaccination, else vaccination will get wasted. Like humans they also have tapeworms, a lot. Vet suggested us Drontal puppy. You first need to weight the puppy and give 1ml/kg body weight. 

Now how do you weight the puppy? Weight yourself first in a scale then substract it from the weight of you holding the puppy on the scale. Drontal puppy suspension liquid comes with a dropper to measure and feed the puppy. 

Be prepared to see a lot of tapeworms coming out in dog's poop. ALWAYS directly apply dettol, lizol on floor and mop during this time. 

Deworm 14days in between during vaccinations.

**The vaccinations.**

After two months from the post (from their birth date) it was vaccination time. Our vet came to our home and did all the vaccinations. 

* 2 months after birth: DHPPi - For Canine Distemper, Hepatitis, Parvo virus and Para-influenza virus.

* 3 months after birth - 1 month after initial DHPPi - DHPPi booster. 

* 4 months after birth - 1 month after DHPPi booster - Rabies shot.

* 5 months after birth - 1 month after rabies shot: Corona shot. 

From second year onwards you have to give DHPPi booster, Rabies booster, and you can give cororna but I feel it's not necessary as this virus is not widespread in India. So two shots in total. 

Regarding charges doc charged us 2k for DHPPi, 2k for DHPPi booster, 1.7k for rabies and 1.8k for Corona. This is total cost of three dogs and doc's charge for coming to home. 


**The first bath:**

Ideally you shouldn't give them bath until few weeks past the first vaccine shot. But you can use Himalaya Freshcoat. You need to spray them over their coat and dry them off with a towel. After the first vaccine I'd suggest to wait for two weeks and give them bath in lukewarm water with Himalaya Erina Coat Cleanser shampoo.

**Holy mites (and fleas).**

If you are adopting a street dog then it's most likely to come with some parasites. Often it comes from mom and environment. You won't notice them until they are 1 or 1.5 and even later days months old. You'll probably notice some bumps, redness, poor coating, blood. Sadly our dogs came with parasites and got [affected in the worst way.](https://imgur.com/a/ApNnu1n) As we couldn't bath them until vaccination we had to use erina fresh coat spray and Erina powder. Those didn't help at all, there was flesh wounds. We used to give Wokazole lotion, Himalaya Scavon spray and they did help to recover from the wounds. They were also itching very badly so doc gave some injections (after first vaccination) which costed us ₹600. 

Those insects also affected me and my mom. Mites spread fast and also on humans. Luckily they don't last long on human. I got redness and bumps all over my elbow and shoulders during that time. My mom got itching for a month! She had to take some anti histamine. 

It's an endless battle. This issue is still present on them, I shower them with two shampoos: bolfo and erina coat cleanser every week with spot on application evey two months. Their coat is way better now. 

**The fights and battles:**

I got two males and one female dog. Earlier they used to eat together but as they grew up they started to fight with each other during eating. One would eat other's food but won't let anyone touch their plate lol. So had to give them food in three rooms which I still do. 

**My deteriorating health during this time:** 

I was really frustrated with the redness and bumps all over my body, also got deeply scratched by them. The scratch happened before they got their rabies vaccine so I was really scared of getting rabies as I didn't have any prior rabies vaccination. I went to a doc and he suggested 5 dose of rabies vaccine on  day 0, 3rd, 7tg, 14th and 28th day.

 Then one day when they were fighting I tried to separate them and by mistake my thumb got punctured into one's lower tooth. It was very deep so I got even more scared, there was endless blood, pain. I washed my thumb into running tap water and also used detergent. Went to same doc in evening, he said not to worry as I was already getting vaccinations so RiG is not needed (Rabies immunoglobulin). He gave me instructions to complete 3 tetanus shots and gave some antibiotic ointment. 

During my last rabies shot I got pneumonia/bronchitis, wasn't able to get up from bed, Had extreme fever of 104-105 and fever stayed there for three days straight, also was experiencing terrible chest pain while getting up or trying to sleep. Mom went to medicine shop and they gave some paracetamol and antibiotic which helped a little but the fever woukd again shot up to 104-105. 

Four days later I went to doc and he gave me same paracetamol, antibiotic but also added penicillin.Which helped tremendously and my fever was gone in next few days. 

But after the fever went away the chest pain didn't. It haunted me for months. Doc prescribed some paracetamol to help and some syrup. In the end it went away. 

Meanwhile while visiting the medicine shop for my last vaccine of rabies they said it won't help if I get the rabies shot that time because it was late. In confusion wheather to start rabies shots again from day 0, I took the last shot and went to doc. He said no worries. 

**Finally here's how they looks now:**

[This one is a male, we call him babla/tiya(Bengali name, tiya means parrot).](https://i.imgur.com/WcIt2Xv.jpg) He's nicest of the bunch, always stays away from fight.

[This one is also a male, we call him Ananda (Happiness).](https://i.imgur.com/xRT2gM9.jpg) He's quite the troublemaker, always fighting, biting and peeing everywhere.

* Here's how she looked when she was around [2 months old.](https://imgur.com/a/1W3Z8XT)

**Some do and don'ts for someone willing to rescue a puppy, or looking to own a dog:**

**Do:**

* Always consult a vet.

* For strays check with locals for approx date of birth, it helps. 

* Stock cheap toilet papers, cotton balls, lizol, dettol, newspapers. You are gonna need it. 

* Always clean floor with dettol after they do their business if they aren't trained. 

* Buy Erina Freshcoat, Erina EP powder. Use them until first bath, this will help with parasites. Also any clotrimazole dusting powder during rainy seasons. Wokazole Plus lotion, scavon spray.

* Deworm properly and carefully. 

* If you are giving them amul milk, amul spray make sure to use little milk, powder and mix with water. 

* Pedigree Pro is a good alternative to Royal Canin. 

* Fresh veggies and foods should be prioritised over pellets. (If you have time)

* Give them treats when they are nice and obeyes your orders. Like hug them a lot. 

* Trim their nails frequently.

**Don't:**

* Do not suddenly change their diet when they are young, this could turn into fata casuality. Always keep in mind the transition period where you have to mix some of old food with new food and gradually increase new food over the period. 

* For newborns ALWAYS check for bedding temperature. Make sure it's tolerable, not too high or low. 

* Milk is always a no no. Curd is good because it has probiotics which helps with digestion. My dog loves amul masti dahi. 

* Don't leave too much gap between meals for young dogs, if their  stomach gets too much empty they'll might vomit during morning or anytime. 

**Was it worth it?**

I would say yes, during this time I got really attached to them. I knew what it takes to raise a child. 

Yes they are always fighting, ruined our walls, our new sofa, our washing machine cover. Our fridge. They wake me up at 5 demanding breakfast, there was a time when I had to wake up at 5 to make breakfast for them. One urinates like fountain. One urinates everywhere. I always get scratched by them. We spent about  ₹10-15k in vaccines, milk, endless bottles of shampoos, scavon spray, Wokazole lotion, spot-ons. 

But all those nuisance doesn't feel bad at all whenever my sister comes home from work and they licks her face with love. You got to see them in person lol, they would make different sounds, gets all excited after hearing door bell then jumps onto her. Same with me and my mom whenever we enter home. 

This turned out to be quite a long post, so sorry for that. Also sorry to everyone who has pmed me and I didn't reply, I was really busy with all these.

1. Chandrayaan 2. I believe the Vikram Lander was never supposed to successfully land or the probability of it being successful was closer to 0. We went ahead with it because of optics and when it did not work, the optics like hugging and other well placed media blurbs made it seem like we gave our best efforts. 

2. The current stock market rise. I believe it is a way to help fund the elections spending for at least one country. Push corporate taxes up 6 months ago, let the market drag down, ensure that the right people buy at depressed levels, reduce corporate taxes, let the market drive up, sell.

Scheduled,Do you feel that Point of view of general public is slightly changed about our PM after yesterday's events?,4,d1625u,Gavthi_Batman,42,"I mean come on, you've got to give him some credit. He landed in bengaluru from two day visit of Russia at afternoon of 7th September. In a day he did meet few people, went to ISRO center at 1:30 AM midnight of 8th September, stayed there late until 2:45 AM, though mission did not go as planned & though with heavy heart he left the place after giving a small speech of encouragement to scientists. Immediately in morning at 8:00 AM, he gave speech at ISRO, Bengaluru facility acknowledging scientists & the nation about Lander mission failure. After that we saw a moving interaction between crying ISRO chief and PM comforting him. This interaction really gave me chills and will be forever etched on my memory. A PM of nation comforting a crying ISRO chief on his shoulders. 

Well, If you think he stopped there, then you are mistaken. He immediately embarked plane to attain the inauguration ceremony of launch of new Mumbai metro lines. He gave a speech there. But before that he didn't forget to attain a 100th anniversary of local Ganapati Mandal. At noon he left Mumbai for Aurangabad, to facilitate 8th crore beneficiary under Ujjwala scheme and to open First Greenfield Smart city there. Another speech. And lastly at the end of the day, he was planned to visit Nagpur but due to heavy rains forecast he unfortunately had to cancel.

Scheduled,"What are we doing parents, teachers and tutors?",10,evkkjj,Felix9694,0,"So I am an independent education consultant from India - who has worked with kids in gaining admissions to top colleges in the US (Cornell, Brown, UPenn), Canada (McGill, Toronto, UBC), and UK (Imperial, Cambridge, Warwick). The past three years that I have spent doing this has brought me closer to the realities of teenhood in modern India. I have become increasingly disillusioned by the number of expectations we have from the young ones! I struggle to schedule calls and meetings with high school students because their schedules are so busy! I have even had calls at midnight in some cases as that's the only time the kid could find.

I am not even sure where this spiral is leading to? The kids are coached at every stage and even overcoached with tuitions starting as early as second grade and parents fretting about if their 4 years old can code?! As someone who grew up in the 90s in India - with a reasonable level of education pressure at the hands of the Indian education system - I sometimes wish I could put a pause on this madness and let the kids be! We have a generation that doesn't know the respite of the languid summer days, the hours spent in a limited screen environment just mucking about the house making scrapbooks, getting dirty or doing whatever the hell WE wanted. Now I know I am going down the rose-tinted glasses route - but as kid boredom leads to discovery. The afternoon I spent going door to door in our building trying to sell peanuts that I found in the house (to the utter embarrassment of my middle-class service job parents) taught me things, the time I spent trying to teach my brother math just because he was a ready audience meant something. What did that have to do with going abroad at 17 for me? NOTHING! But they are the fondest memories that continue to affect my well being even decades later.

A key part of me working with kids is exploring their dreams and aspirations when it comes to going to college abroad and when I start throwing around words like dreams and aspirations and interests I am very often met with silent stares or rehearsed answers that they seem to have heard from their parents at a dinner party. We have all seen the ads for tuition centres that promise superior coaching by IIT alumni or the mind-boggling number of apps that are literally in our faces all the time. The coding academy, the robotics classes, the tuitions for the school tuition, the study abroad fairs with ""direct"" admissions, the new swanky IB school, the freaking fingerprint career aptitude test (yep you heard it right) ... spiralling into a multi-billion dollar industry that profits off the parental anxieties. I have been part of it ... and I don't think I want to be at least till I think this more.

But, now I am closer to saying ""rehne do!"" or ""let them be!"" But then we add in the element of international admissions and we can't ""rehne do!"" So I think in India we love us some formulas - with parents that are a direct result of formulaic learning themselves when we look at international education preparation we just work better with equations. This much social service, this much coding, this much school activities, this much SAT etc etc etc. We approach the SAT like we approach the JEE. With the idea to ""Crack it!"" whatever that means. We put our kids in IB curriculum which is individualistic and intensive, at schools which promise the best teachers - yet send our kids lugging round to tuitions. I mean if I need tuitions after paying Rs 10,00,000 + in fees - what am I paying for?! Then there are those resume-building activities - the internships that you source from a friend of a friend, the certificates from causes and NGOs that magically appear and that the kids feign enthusiasm for in their essays. I think the study abroad aspirations hit our shores like the cyclone hitting Rameshwaram. And in the winds, it is the teens who were swept up.

I speak from the Indian perspective but if the ""success"" of varsity blues scandal in the US, or the rise of Asian tiger mom ideology is anything to go by the issue seems like an international educational challenge that we aren't talking about enough. I get it that we want our kids to study in the best colleges if we are paying millions of dollars converted from our Indian incomes - but I feel like there is a better way for us to approach this. I would like to hear your opinions as I continue finding my own way through this chaos.

I put in an sick leave and stayed home for this interview. It was scheduled in the morning. But I never received a call. I called them back every time she said she'll check and let me know. I was sitting at home all dressed for the entire day waiting for a call. At least she should have said it'll be postponed or something. But no. Even at 5 pm when I called she said she'll get back to me in a minute. Again nothing. Now I don't know what to do. Do i mail her asking how they can play around with people's time?

Scheduled,Disappointing startup environment here in India,19,c3magi,the4thkillermachine,20,"As the title suggests, although there are some really good (supposedly) government initiatives on incubating infant startups but I haven't once come across a discussion thread related to startups in this subreddit. So I was wondering if you've a startup or did and it failed for some reason or the other, how was the experience? What lessons did you learn from it? Do you've plans for another one? What were some bureaucratic hurdles you have faced and how are you supposed to tackle them?

A fact that caught me by surprise was that the IT sector contributes 7.7% to the GNP which definitely correlates to the fact that the tech environment in the country isn't as impotent as suggested by various reports. Agreed that a significant portion of the software engineers are in need of a major reskilling but look at the bigger picture. India is a country of 1.3Bn people and out of it, for a small section of the populace who are into IT, to contribute close to 8% of the \~3Tn economy is damn huge! 

Considering this, it's hard to believe that, not even one of those millions strong IT workforce failed to come up with a noble and most importantly a sustainable business of his/her own. Anyway, that's just my opinion from looking at certain statistics and although numbers rarely lie but sometimes fail to portray a bigger picture of an underlying issue.

I'm looking to having an open discussion here and if it works out maybe I could try out a scheduled discussion thread on startups, to discuss everything from ideas to official procedures, etc. So tell me more about your startup(s) and help me understand the startup scenario better in this country.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c3magi/disappointing_startup_environment_here_in_india/

Scheduled,Pros and cons of living in Hyderabad. Feel free to add your perspectives or discuss how your city is better than Hyderabad in the cons department I mentioned here,67,d5drp3,lolwhyry,57,"Pros - 

- It's affordable for anybody. 

- Enough uptown cafes and clubs for anyone to explore.

- The distances aren't nearly as far as other metro cities. Travelling the entire stretch of the city shouldn't take longer than 2 hours. 

- The metro makes connectivity to all major areas areas and landmarks easier. The only place it isn't covered is probably Attapur and towards the Airport. 
 
- The airport is almost equidistant from all major residential areas. 

- IT/Corporate hub! Don't have to say more. There are enough opportunities for everybody.  Gachibowli and Hi-Tech city are so well developed that being a resident of this very city, I'm still in awe at how cool the corporate buildings are everytime I go to that part of the town. 

- It's relatively safe, for women especially. Keyword - relatively. You have creeps and psychopaths everywhere, but there are lesser crimes reported from Hyderabad.

- Most locals are welcoming and helpful.

- The GHMC and Hyderabad traffic police are responsible enough to act on infrastructural shortcomings, the regular water logging and the flow of traffic. They make communication easier with their WhatsApp numbers and apps. It's upto you to be outspoken and giving them information via their social media and helpline numbers.

- You see Hindus and Muslims especially living together in harmony. Temples and Masjids literally right next to each other. 
They're really indifferent to whatever the political mood is at the center. It's a good kind of indifference. You almost never see protests or violence in the name of religion, and this city should really be the hallmark of communal harmony for anyone to follow.

- Less traffic during the weekends so you can schedule your recreational plans then.

Cons -

- It's polluted, overpopulated, has a lot of traffic, but this can be said about any major Indian city.

- You have to haggle a lot with autos. They never follow the meter. 

- A lack of last mile connectivity from metro stations to short radiuses. Makes me change plans or compromise with visiting places which are just walkable from metro stations.

- Uber and Ola autos cancel on you if you pay online and not physical cash. 
Uber and Ola do surge a lot and you have to be ready to pay over a 100 to just travel 2-3km.  But again, this holds true for any Indian city and not particularly Hyderabad. 

- RTC buses are a nightmare. Unusable.

- It takes trial and error to know what routes have the worst traffic and around what times during the day/during what festivals. Traffic from Tank Bund is diverted during some festivals because of religious procession. Google maps can't be relied upon completely. 

- Secunderabad has the worst traffic. I was stuck in traffic for over an hour to reach a place which was just 3km away. 

- The weather is harsh - extremely hot summers and very cold winters. You have to be privileged enough to have air conditioning to survive the 45° +  summers. 
Off late, it's not even been raining as much during the monsoon months, and that is concerning in the long run.

- Lack of good colleges and universities for commerce and the arts. There are no good private universities or colleges for the non engineering fields. The Central University called Osmania University has the worst and most redundant curriculums. 
It's however, slightly better for post graduate management education.  
 
- I personally want Hyderabad to have more hobbyist events and activities in terms of art, literature, public speaking, etc. It is at a good place, but still not ""woke enough"" if I may. It can get better. 

Summed up everything I could think of.

I've been living in Hyderabad for almost 8 years now, and I want to move to another city to grow as a person and gain more perspective. But I'm glad to have a place of my own in Hyderabad and be able to ""fall back"" here whenever I want. It's one of the best livable cities for Indian standards.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d5drp3/pros_and_cons_of_living_in_hyderabad_feel_free_to/

Scheduled,ok lets have some serious talk,0,e10dmz,jiviteshkadost,39,"i am going to get straight to the point I think that the schedule caste  system is corrupt and if being misused by that I mean that it is a wrong privilege for SC,s to get special treatment for ex  more chance in exams even if they score low or not  which means that the general is kind of being discriminated I am no expert at law so take what I say with a grain of salt 

then the point is that if the government didn't want  SC,s to be discriminated  then they should take away their privilege's  as most  hatred and discrimination by the general class toward the SC,s is that they now have an outright advantage in academics and college enrollment

Scheduled,I have been getting calls from some organization called Child Help Foundation and want to know if they are legit.,20,d6dy01,sleepygamer92,18,"So some lady called Seema contacted me yesterday asking me to donate some money for some child's operation. I was outside at the time and asked her to contact me later. So she called me again today. When I asked her where she got my number from, she is not replying. On repeatedly asking, she said some database (but was very vague about it). I started asking her multiple questions about the disease and treatment and all she said she will send me pictures and documents about it, but was once again, very vague. On asking her more questions about the hospital, she kept saying they are legit and the child needs help. When I bluffed and said that since I am a journalist, let me do some background check and get back to you, she sounded a little concerned and said okay and asked me to call back when I can.

Now I have been doing some research and found a website and all for this, but there is absolutely no buzz on the thing they want to the fact that it seems made up. I found something about the child she mentioned and apparently the surgery was scheduled for yesterday, so dunno why she is calling me today also. I found a similar letter of appeal from the doctor she mentioned by name, but for another child. I don't know, a lot of things about this whole thing seem fishy.

**TL;DR - I wanted to know if anyone has gotten a call from some Seema (or anyone else) from Child Help Foundation asking for a donation for a child called Sia Samanta who's operation costs 16.5 Lakhs. If it is fake, I am legit going to a journalist friend and tweeting to the cops about this shit along with her number and all so they don't exploit other people.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d6dy01/i_have_been_getting_calls_from_some_organization/
Scheduled,Please help me out.,28,dr3nqk,Throwaway_851216,15,"Hello r/India.
This post is a bit personal, just need help and some mental peace.If my sentences are a bit incoherent please forgive me because I'm overwhelmed with emotions at the moment. 
So here begins my story,I (24M) was born and brought up in Kerala. I got through the medical entrance exam and took up a medical seat in Maharashtra . Didn't have any problems but felt homesick finally got over it and started studying for my future in medicine. The first semester in Ist M.B.B.S goes very good, my problems begin in the second semester where i start having issues with my health.During this period i consulted many doctors. I'm unstable and bed ridden, taking multiple pain killers and muscle relaxants prescribed by them.The doctors aren't able to give me a diagnosis a few months pass keep in mind even in such a state I'm studying. I give my prelim examination and barely make it. I'm geared up to give my Ist M.B.B.S exam. My health takes a turn for the worst and now I'm unable to move, my parents come all the way from Kerala. They aren't able to see me in such a state and they take me back to Kerala . They get me checked up and within 2 days the competent doctor gives me the diagnosis, i have T.B spine. My parents are shell shocked, my mother starts crying. I felt numb. I felt helpless. My treatment schedule is put in place and i start with my medication. The treatment plan was for a year, with physiotherapy. Luckily the  vertebrae involved ankylosed without causing a need for surgical involvement. I healed physically. Now my treatment was done,  i was healthy. But during this period all the friends i had made in my college, were now strangers. I had become a social pariah. I didn't disclose my illness except to 1 close friend who was also from Kerala . He kept me updated on what was going on in college even though he had moved to the second year. I had completed my treatment and had to sit for the Ist M.B.B.S exam. With 2 months left after my treatment, i give it my all and with the grace of God i make it through. Now begins the second year, I'm with a completely new batch. I became a junior. Nobody knows who i am. I thought i get a fresh start. But slowly the news spreads and they get to know that I'm from their senior batch. Initially they assumed i was a transfer. Initially people tried making small talk with me and i was soon ""friends"" with a few of the people from this batch. Slowly i was isolated and my ""seniors"" wanted nothing to do with me. I was completely alone, even my close friend got busy with his life and abandoned me aswell. My parents kept asking me how the new batch was and if i had adjusted. I lied to them just to make them feel better that everything was perfect. Keep in mind my parents are doctors and they have extremely busy schedules and I didn't want to burden them further. Now somehow i have kept myself together with the support of my parents, the only people i talk to are my parents. I somehow made it through the second and third year aswell, now I'm in my final year. This year has been nerve-wracking. All i do is study, eat and sleep. I'm completely alone. All the ridicule i face from my batchmates and juniors has got me all messed up ( for something that wasnt my fault at all). I don't know who i can trust anymore.I have no one in my life besides my family. There is only so much I can take. I'm in another state away from home questioning my sanity. My batchmates are now in internship. They'll graduate soon. Everyday i keep thinking what i had done to deserve this. I keep thinking is it worth it to even live anymore.  Why should i pain myself to become a doctor at all under such pathetic conditions? Why should i have to live with this? If this is how the society is I'd rather be dead.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dr3nqk/please_help_me_out/

Scheduled,Sewage workers in India,32,d5hiim,boss_bj,12,"Sewage workers in India suffer from the worst work-environment and we are doing nothing about it. They literally take a dip inside the sewage tanks filled with shit or sewage water to clean the clogged up drains and many die due to the poisonous gas build up inside those tanks. What kind of human would do it to themselves? Believe me, they don't. They drink a lot before and after to avoid the trauma of working in such conditions. And that takes a toll on their financial condition(which is already low) and their family. So, what's the solution? 

There should be a law which prevents man-power to clean sewage drains and tanks. But that's already there in the law! Then what's the hurdle? There's a lack of safety equipments and technical equipments to clean the drains without a man entering the manholes. They do it because there's no other way to do it. And people expect them to do it because almost all sewage workers belong to the scheduled caste. These casteist feelings are present everywhere which alienates their voice for a reform in the system. 

In my opinion, Indian government must spend money on buying advanced sewage equipments and safety equipments and masks. And they should be present in every municipality office, for free. Government should also conduct training programs to teach the sewage workers on how to use those equipments effectively. And the final step is that of citizens, to stop looking at them as the ""untouchables"" and appreciate them as human beings who clean up your shit, so that you don't have to.

Politics,Pitting a community against a political party is fucking stupid.,196,futac9,chillinvillain122,73,"First of all let me start by saying it was stupid whatever some muslims did at nizamuddin and still are doing by staying hidden and not letting the authorities do their work efficiently. 

But this rant is not just about this situation, it is about people's ignorance and lack of knowledge, people don't understand what is propoganda, and they don't know there history either and they continue to pit up a communuty against a political party. No BJP does not represent Hindus all it represents are the hindu extremists, so when i say fuck bjp, it means, fuck the politicians who are making this country burn. Bjp is the only party who has reached new heights and depths of instigating people to turn on each other, and paint muslims as someone who are gonna attack hindus for no reason. Regardless of what people want, a political party's job is to maintain communal harmony in a democratic country. What part of this people don't undertstand ? and why are dalits even supporting BJP's assholes, they beat up dalits, discriminate against them, all bjp is trying to do is keep brahmin supremacy in this country. Everyone is crazy about religion, i say fuck religion, if you believe in a higher power that is cool i don't care but killing in the name of god, fuck no.

Had to get this off my chest, sorry, and thanks for reading if you made it to the end.

A bunch of us (various nationalities) were sitting around discussing the news, and one of my fellow indian girls was telling us about a video she saw. A young Pakistani student in China had posted it saying that air India had evacuated the Indian students in his Chinese university and that no one was coming for him. 

There was apparently an overwhelming amount of support from fellow students asking air India to evacuate all students irrespective of race. 

I mentioned that the one good thing that could come out of this virus would be a true and total support for fellowmen. And the girl said ""Pakistan isn't equipped to deal with this virus. They aren't equipped to deal with a viral fever. They could all die.. and it would be a good thing if they were all wiped out."" 
I have never felt more shocked. 

Irrespective of historical politics between our nations, hoping for an entire country to die out is horrible. This is a global pandemic and the best time to set aside all our biases and support everyone. Everyone has loved ones who we're worried about. We are all susceptible to the virus just as much as every other race. 

Let's put aside religion and take care of each other.

Politics,A polite request to all Indians here,23,g2ct57,aaluinsonaout,8,"I don't know if it is the same situation in other countries, but in India, I have seen A LOT of organisations which have very toxic environments.

There are offices where senior managers harass / shout at juniors, there are colleges where senior students rag juniors, there are school teachers who make fun of students who are not so good at studies and so on.

In many of the cases, I have seen that seniors harass juniors only because they were themselves harassed in the past by their own seniors. Many managers pick up the habit of shouting at juniors because they were shouted at too, when they were juniors. Do you see the problem here? - This cycle is never going to stop. One able person will harass another - this person will then harass someone else  and this will keep continuing.

So here is my request - BREAK THE CHAIN. Try to be polite to people (especially juniors around you). Try not to vent out your frustration on your maid. When you shout on her, she may not reply you, but she is definitely going to shout at someone else that day to vent out her frustration (perhaps she might shout at her kids). This will slowly start to have impact and I am hopeful people will get healthier work environments.

The problem is that I am recovering from an eating disorder and it’s really important for me that I listen to my fullness cues otherwise I’m super prone to relapse. 

It’s also troubling because many members of his family are overweight and I am really nervous at the thought of visiting them and being pressured to eat more than I am comfortable with.

As per the procedure,now home ministry is one of the most important in current condition , but Amit shah who can confidently take press conferences unlike his guru is seen nowhere.

Was having a chat with a old friend who is a gujrat based journalist, he was saying that Modi dreams have got bigger and he is now aiming to become somewhat of a global icon and dreaming of a nobel prize like Obama , the reason we see him buttering international leaders like Trump and Jinping.Modi is also video conferencing other chief ministers and taking stock of this pandemic albeit in a very democratic manner.

Few months back, he has instructed party top brass to keep Hindu-Muslim politics aside as he will go for a image rebuilding in the coming years.
But Shah is Shah, his entire political career is based on communal politics, and he is quite dope on that and cannot survive if he doesn't do his regular drama. 

We can see the notorius UP police filing FIRs on news channels on false reporting of Tabliki jamaat attendees , it was an outcome of Modi giving a stern warning to party top brass to not give a communal twist to corona pandemic.

Taking a side step, splitting Andhra resulted in Congress losing the state and two regional parties talking over. Maybe splitting the larger states could accelerate this process? Spitting MP said did not have the same effect, so I know it is not a reliable way to do it.

Politics,My fears about how the current political situation would affect the Republic Day celebrations turned out to be true.,228,eu36ic,XeroXeroIchi,36,"I've been attending the flag hoisting at our colony's association building for years now. Our colony has always been a lot diverse in terms of religion. Everything was normal after the flag hoisting ceremony, members of the association gave speeches about our constitutional rights, fundamental rights and duties as well as secularism but it soon went downhill from that.

Another man from the colony started his speech about how our constitution and laws need amendments time after time and we should support them, and then he yelled that no matter what we believe we are must respect the national flag and national anthem and those who didn't do that or didn't return the cheer of ""Bharat Mata Ki Jai"" are of no use to this colony or nation. An odd 4-5 people clapped at his statement after which he proceeded to yell ""Bharat Mata ki Jai"" and specifically pointed out this Old Muslim Man who wore a skull cap and came with his grandchildren of about 6-7 years of age that he wasn't cheering the same and he shouldn't stay here. When the old man started to leave, all the 10-12 association members and the president consoled him to stay while he was pulling away, his grandchildren started crying and the 20-25 odd schoolchildren who were there looked perplexed.

The old man decided to stay albeit being a lot sadder and angrier, yelling that he's been here longer than he has and is more patriotic than he ever will be. This incident was followed by the Association President's message that ""No person was supposed to force his beliefs and practices. Everyone has the right to cheer or not cheer for whatever they want"". He proceeded to apologise to the man for the speaker's words and invited him specifically to the function after this. The members of the association then proceeded to apologise and console him. 

Meanwhile, the man who gave the statement was being confronted by a single person for his words and was also being supported by one other man. He shook his hand and praised him for his words.

Ironically, the man who supported his words had stuck his paper flag on his heart turned upside down. 

This incident had me fuming but I calmed down after reminding myself that it was one guy (and the 4-5 odd people who clapped for him) against the 10-12 members and elders of the association who consoled the old man.

[Image from the incident](http://imgur.com/a/a4JA2Qb)

The man in the blue shirt and the red circle was the one who gave the speech, the man in the brown shirt and the blue circle was the man who supported him. The other man in white confronted him and counselled him for his words. I could add a voice record that I recorded out of fear and anticipation that something of this sort would happen.

TL;DR : Muslim man was told to leave the flag hoisting event by a person for not cheering ""Bharat Mata Ki Jai"" infront of  association members and children from the colony. Association apologizes and condemns his words.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eu36ic/my_fears_about_how_the_current_political/

*When you question their sacred texts*  
*Written by woman-hating epileptics*  

*Their languages just serve to confuse them*

But not much to my surprise, voters of Delhi gave this huge mandate against the decisive policies and stood up with a progressive approach.

Now as the analysis were going on, experts on TV pointed out some really interesting traits of Kejriwal's Election campaign, which were basically some core reasons behind this victory:

>Not getting into communal vs secular scenario

>Made arguments on work profile.

>Assumed a soft hindutva position. Rejected an Idea that is Hindutva but not a belief that is Hinduism.

>Redefined 'Nationalism'. Rejected Bhajapa's version of the same thing.

Politics,101 years of Jallianwala Bagh massacre | Background | Aftermath | Shaheed Uddham Singh [Mega Thread],259,g0dofi,Neglectedsince1994,57,"***\*Picture thread attached at the bottom, please read before you check it, I've tried to keep it as short yet detailed as possible\****

The **Jallianwala Bagh massacre**, also known as the **Amritsar massacre**, took place on 13 April 1919, when Acting Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer ordered troops of the British Indian Army to fire their rifles into a crowd of unarmed Indian civilians in Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar, Punjab, killing at least 400 people including men and women. Over 1,000 people were injured.

Some facts about the Jallianwala Bagh massacre:

1. The precursor to the Massacre was the Rowlatt Act. This act was passed in February 1919.
2. The Rowlatt Act gave the British Government the authority to arrest anyone on grounds of mere suspicion.
3. The Rowlatt Act was basically designed for controlling activities of Indian Revolutionaries.
4. Protesting against the act, the Indians observed a hartal on March 30th and April 6th of 1919.
5. On April 10, 1919, two famous leaders, Dr. Kitchlew and Dr. Satyapal were arrested on the basis of the Rowlatt Act.
6. Two days later on the 12th of April, 1919, General Dyer took command of troops. He issued a proclamation banning all public gatherings
7. Though the proclamation was issued, no efforts were made to ensure that the general public came to know about it.
8. The gathering had no political intent at all. It was meant for celebrating Baisakhi – the Sikh festival.
9. Anywhere between 6,000 and 10,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh on the evening of that day.
10. The gathering included even children and women since it was all about celebrating Baisakhi.
11. Though the festival was a Sikh festival, many Hindus and Muslims also came to celebrate the same. All of them were there for commemorating the day when Khalsa Panth was founded by Guru Gobind Singh.
12. Apart from the main entrance, there was no way for the crowd to escape the garden as the area was surrounded by buildings. This is a major reason for the high number of casualties.
13. Apart from Gurkha and  Baluchi soldiers using Scinde rifles, there were also two armored cars with machine guns that were used in the shooting.
14. According to records, the people gathered were not warned or asked to disperse before Colonel Dyer ordered the firing.
15. The firings stopped only when the soldiers ran out of ammunition.
16. The shooting was followed by the proclamation of [martial law](https://www.britannica.com/topic/martial-law) in the Punjab that included public floggings and other humiliations
17. Indian outrage grew as news of the shooting and subsequent British actions spread throughout the subcontinent. The Bengali poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore renounced the knighthood that he had received in 1915.
18. Gandhi was initially hesitant to act, but he soon began organizing his first large-scale and sustained nonviolent protest ([*satyagraha*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/satyagraha-philosophy)) campaign, the [noncooperation movement](https://www.britannica.com/event/noncooperation-movement) (1920–22), which thrust him to prominence in the Indian nationalist struggle.
19. Dyer was initially lauded for his actions in Britain and became a hero among many who were directly benefiting from the [British Raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj) such as members of the [House of Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords). He was, however, widely criticised in the [House of Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons), whose July 1920 committee of investigation censured him.
20. The government of India ordered an investigation of the incident (the Hunter Commission), which in 1920 [censured](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/censured) Dyer for his actions and ordered him to resign from the military.
21. The last known survivor of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, Shingara Singh, died in Amritsar on June 29, 2009, at the age of 113.
22. The British Government tried to suppress information of the massacre, but news spread in India and widespread outrage ensued; details of the massacre did not become known in Britain until December 1919.
23. This event caused many moderate Indians to abandon their loyalty to the  British and become nationalists distrustful of the British
24. Colonel Dyer reported to his superiors that he had been ""confronted by a  revolutionary army"", to which Major General William Beynon replied:  ""Your action correct and Lieutenant Governor approves
25. Both [Secretary of State for War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_War) [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill) and former Prime Minister [H. H. Asquith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Asquith),  however, openly condemned the attack, Churchill referring to it as  ""unutterably monstrous"", while Asquith called it ""one of the worst, most dreadful, outrages in the whole of our history"".
26. Winston Churchill, in the House of Commons debate of 8 July 1920, said,  ""The crowd was unarmed, except with bludgeons. It was not attacking anybody or anything… When the fire had been opened upon it to disperse it,  it tried to run away. Pinned up in a narrow place considerably smaller than Trafalgar Square, with hardly any exits, and packed together so that one bullet would drive through three or four bodies, the people ran madly this way and the other. When the fire was directed upon the centre, they ran to the sides. The fire was then directed to the sides.  Many threw themselves down on the ground, the fire was then directed down on the ground. This was continued to 8 to 10 minutes, and it  stopped only when the ammunition had reached the point of exhaustion.""
27. After Churchill's speech in the House of Commons debate, MPs voted 247 to 37 against Dyer and in support of the Government.
28. The General Dyer-led massacre at Amritsar’s Jalianwalla Bagh, in 1919,  left an indelible dent on the psyche of millions of Indians.
29. Colonel Michael O'Dwyer was shot dead on 13 March, 1940, by a man named Udham Singh, a member of the revolutionist Ghadar party who was on a mission of revenge for the  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre.
30. The casualty number estimated by the Indian National Congress was more than 1,500 injured, with approximately 1,000 dead.
31. Indian nationalist [Swami Shraddhanand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Shraddhanand) wrote to Gandhi of 1500 deaths in the incident.

# Shaheed Uddham Singh

1. **Shaheed Udham Singh** (26 December 1899 – 31 July 1940), was a  revolutionary belonging to the Ghadar Party best known for his  assassination in London of Michael O'Dwyer, the former lieutenant governor of Punjab in India, on 13 March 1940
2.  While in custody, he used the name **Ram Mohammad Singh Azad**, which represents the three major religions of Punjab and his anti-colonial sentiment 
3. Shaheed Uddham Singh waited 21 years for revenge by killing the man he held responsible for the atrocity: the then lieutenant governor of Punjab Province, General  Michael O'Dyer.
4. While awaiting his trial, Singh went on a 42-day hunger strike and was force-fed. On 4 June 1940
5. When asked about his motivation, Singh explained:

>I did it because I had a grudge against him. He deserved  it. He was the real culprit. He wanted to crush the spirit of my  people, so I have crushed him. For full 21 years, I have been trying to  seek vengeance. I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of  death. I am dying for my country.  I have seen my people starving in  India under the British rule. I have protested against this, it was my  duty. What greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the  sake of my motherland?

Singh was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On 31 July 1940, Singh was hanged at [Pentonville Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentonville_Prison).

# Following his conviction, he made a speech

which the judge directed should not be released to the press.\[9\] However, political activists who had set up the Shaheed Udham Singh Trust and working with the Indian Workers Association (GB), ran a campaign to have the court record of his statement published along with other material

He started the speech with a denunciation of British Imperialism:

>""I say down with British Imperialism. You say India do not have peace. We have only slavery Generations of so-called civilization has brought us everything filthy and degenerating. known to the human race.  All you have to do is read your own history. If you have any human decency about you, you should die with shame. The brutality and bloodthirsty way in which the so-called intellectuals who call themselves  rulers of civilization in the world are bastard blood . . .""  
>  
>At this point, he was interrupted by the judge, but after some discussion, he continued:  
>  
>""I do not care about the sentence of death. It means nothing at all.  I do not care about dying or anything. I do not worry about it at all. I  am dying for a purpose.’ Thumping the rail of the dock, he exclaimed,  ‘We are suffering from the British Empire.’ Udham Singh continued more quietly. ‘I am not afraid to die. I am proud to die, to have to free my native land and I hope that when I am gone, I hope that in my place will come thousands of my countrymen to drive you dirty dogs out; to free my country.  
>  
>""I am standing before an English jury. I am in an English court.  You people go to India and when you come back you are given a prize and put in the House of Commons. We come to England and we are sentenced to  death.’  
>  
>""I never meant anything, but I will take it. I do not care anything about it, but when you dirty dogs come to India there comes a  time when you will be cleaned out of India. All your British Imperialism  will be smashed.’ ""Machine guns on the streets of India mow down thousands of poor  women and children wherever your so-called flag of democracy and  Christianity flies.’  
>  
>""Your conduct, your conduct – I am talking about the British government. I have nothing against the English people at all. I have more English friends living in England than I have in India. I have great sympathy with the workers of England. I am against the Imperialist  Government.’  
>  
>""You people are suffering – workers. Everyone are suffering through these dirty dogs; these mad beasts. India is only slavery.  Killing, mutilating and destroying – British Imperialism. People do not read about it in the papers. We know what is going on in India.""  
>  
>At this point, the judge refused to hear any more, but Singh continued:  
>  
>""You ask me what I have to say. I am saying it. Because you people are dirty. You do not want to hear from us what you are doing in  India.  
>  
>He then thrust his glasses back into his pocket, and exclaimed three words in Hindustani and then shouted:  
>  
>'Down with British Imperialism! Down with British dirty dogs!""  
>  
>He turned to leave the dock, spitting across the solicitor’s table.

&#x200B;

His remains are preserved at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, Punjab.  On every 31 July, marches are held in Sunam by various organizations and every statue of Singh in the city is paid tribute with flower garlands.

Politics,"Did Sharad Pawar, NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena just defeat BJP in the Greatest Game of Political Chess to have been played in India?",830,e1yy9u,jasonj2232,125,"After weeks of political maneuvering, backstabbing and drama that if it were made into a television series would rival Game of Thrones and House of Cards (and we're not talking about S8 GoT and S6 HoC), it looks like we're finally getting some clarity about what is happening, what has happened and what will happen in Maharashtra.

If you haven't been following, here is what happened:

* The people of Maharashtra voted in the State Elections on 21/10/2019.
* The primary alliances competing in the elections were the NDA (made up of BJP and Shiv Sena) and the UPA (made up of NCP and Congress).
* BJP lost 17 seats and Shiv Sena lost 7 while Congress gained 2 seats and the NCP gained 13.
* BJP got the largest share of votes but no individual party got enough seats to form a majority government (required number of seats to form a government in the Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha is 145).
* After the results were declared, the Shiv Sena refused to form a government with the BJP because their demands for equal share in power and the post of CM for 2.5 years was not met.
* The governor (a member of the BJP and RSS btw), from the 8th to the 11th of November, invited the BJP, then the Shiv Sena and then the NCP to form the government and prove majority.
* After all parties either refused to or failed to prove majority, President's Rule was imposed on 12th November.
* Meanwhile, the Congress, NCP and the Shiv Sena (which has historically opposed and has been opposed by the Congress and NCP and has a vastly different ideology compared to the NCP and the Congress)  entered into an alliance together to form the government.
* Before they could form the government though, Ajit Pawar, nephew of Sharad Pawar and his chosen representative, 'broke away' from the NCP along with a few 'rebel' MLAs and joined hands with the BJP to form the government.
* On 23 November, at 5:36 AM, the governor revoked President's rule and accepted the formation of the BJP-Ajit PAwar government, administering the oath of office to Devendra Fadnavis, who became the CM and entered his second term , and Ajit Pawar, who became Deputy CM. Suspiciously, around this same time, all corruption charges and investigations against Ajit Pawar were dropped.
* The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena challenged the formation of this government in the Supreme Court and demanded a floor test. Sharad Pawar publicly disavowed Ajit Pawar and his actions.
* The Supreme Court directed the new government to prove its majority by evening today.
* Today, unable to prove majority, Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar resigned and the new government was dissolved.

What is happening (as of 19:42 IST) and will happen:

* The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena will form government with Uddhav Thackeray as the CM.
* MLAs from all three parties are in the Trident Hotel rn to elect Uddhav as their CM.
* Ajit Pawar and the 'rebel' MLAs from the NCP are back in the NCP. ~~Ajit Pawar will be Deputy CM~~ (edit: it's still left to be seen what Ajit Pawar's fate is but the process of reconciliation seems to have already started).
* The terms of the power sharing, AFAIK, are still unknown but will most probably be that Shiv Sena and NCP will hold the CM post for 2.5 years each with the Congress will play a supporting role, with all three parties sharing equal power.

(Edit: What follows is speculation from my side but imo it is very probable that this might have happened)

 Now all this might seem like a crazy series of events, but I can't help but feel that all events, after the Shiv Sena entered into an alliance with the NCP and Congress, have been carefully orchestrated by all three parties and especially Sharad Pawar, who I believe has shown Amit Shah that Shah is still a diaper-wearing amateur at a game that Pawar is a veteran of. 

Sharad Pawar and Co have managed to:

* **Split the Sena-BJP alliance:** Although the alliance was always rocky, Pawar and Co have managed to split a natural alliance of the BJP and Shiv Sena that was borne out of a shared Hindutva idealogy, while simultaneously managing to form an alliance with their bitter rivals.
* **Prevent BJP from forming the government:** Now this seems super obvious, but its very impressive considering the fact that BJP netted the most amount of votes in the election.
* **Exposed the hypocrisy of the BJP:** BJP has always run on a platform that stated that their party and government were not corrupt, unlike the opposition who has had multiple huge corruption scandals. It was one of the major reasons why they won in 2014. Now, after the saga with Ajit Pawar (who, lets face it, was never seriously splitting with the NCP, and all this was just a ploy), Sharad Pawar has managed to expose the corrupt nature of the BJP in a very public manner.
* **Saved Ajit Pawar from jail:** This is the cherry on top for Pawar and Co and possibly the most stinging thing to happen to the BJP during this whole saga. Pawar has not just managed to expose the corruption of the BJP but also managed to save his nephew from the consequences of corruption using his enemy as the deliverer/tool of salvation.

Now all this is great and dandy for Pawar, NCP, Shiv Sena and the Congress but what does it mean for us observers and the voters of Maharashtra? Well these are the conclusions I ended up on after this whole saga:

* **DEMOCRACY IS DEAD**: I'm sure all the voters who voted for Shiv Sena because they wanted the BJP in power and all the voters who voted for NCP and Congress because they did not want the Shiv Sena in power are feeling duped, betrayed and angry rn, and they have a very good reason to be. If, ultimately, the choice of a population does not even matter, what point is there to Democracy? What point is there to voting? Might as well choose the next government based on who is better at Jenga or Monopoly - Sharad Pawar, Uddhav Thackeray, Devendra Fadnavis or Balasaheb Thorat.
* **INTEGRITY, IDEOLOGY AND PRINCIPLES DON'T MATTER**: All that matters now is power. Yeah the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena have managed to defeat the BJP but at what cost? All parties involved have betrayed the core principles and ideas upon which their parties were found by entering into this alliance. Why even have separate parties then? 
* **VOTERS DON'T MATTER:** All 3 parties have betrayed the trust that their voters and supporters placed in them meanwhile the BJP has betrayed the trust that the general public lays on institutions and figures like the Governor who are supposed to be neutral.

Sharad Pawar and Co might have just managed to win the greatest game of political chess to have been played in India but it is the rest of us common folk who have lost. Regardless of which political ideology you believe in or which party you support, I hope you can agree when I say that this entire saga was a dark period for democracy in India.

Edit: We still can't say for sure if this whole Ajit Pawar saga was a carefully constructed ploy or if he actually betrayed (he is know to make rash decisions) Sharad Pawar. He wasn't present at the joint press conference of the parties where Uddhav Thackeray was announced as the CM and some NCP members asked Sharad Pawar to ensure that Ajit Pawar is back in the fold asap. So it's still unclear but I can definitely say for sure that whether this was by intention or not, it has only helped the NCP-Shiv Sena-Congress alliance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e1yy9u/did_sharad_pawar_ncp_congress_and_shiv_sena_just/

It was well known he was a hard left individual, with interests in the Russian revolution's Marxist and Socialist policies. He was a patriot and nationalist but never thrived off of it. In my view, it was the best kind of *positive* nationalism wherein you respected and fought for your nation's freedom and dignity but also participated in the active growth of its people from a moral and economical standpoint and did not rely on relentless fanning of the flames to attain unity.

Imagine an India which was built on strong but fair leftist grounds which stressed on equality of sexes, equality of opportunity, **mandatory education**, economic liberation, powerful military and more with equal stress on India being Democratic Republic. 

> Subhash Chandra Bose never interpreted nationalism in its narrow ,perverted and aggressive form. He viewed Indian nationalism from the stand point of  a humanist To3 Bose ,‘Indian nationalism is neither narrow, nor selfish, nor aggressive.It is inspired by the highest ideals of the human race.


There is unequivocally nothing that can really beat this combination of non-exploitative, non-authoritarian socialist country. I know some think-tanks have flirted with the idea of Bose being a ""Hitler"" but one, he was pro-Democracy and two:


> “When I first visited Germany in 1933, I had hopes that the new German nation, which has risen to a new consciousness of its national strength and self-respect, would instinctively feel a deep sympathy for other nations struggling in the same direction.Today,I regret that I have to return to India with the conviction that the new nationalism of Germany is not only narrow and selfish, but also arrogant”

In my opinion, India should have been under a rigorous leadership for a decade or so to set the grounds for **mass education**, equal opportunities, equality of sexes, liberal economic principles and abolition of poverty AND THEN gone on to open up the market internationally and engage in (controlled) Capitalistic ventures where you invest in foreign countries and foreign countries can invest in yours, independent businesses can thrive and so on and which will see a surge in not only economic status but exchange of culture with the people of India **ready for such a venture** as opposed to now where most Indians barely know who they are, what their history is and what their culture is about.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ewi9qq/politics_how_would_india_have_looked_like_if_it/

Politics,[P] How to deal with parents who support extreme government authoritarianism?,66,fwo8b6,impstuff,28,"My dad seems to be going down this path of extreme authoritarianism. He gets most of his news from Republic TV and is a heavy Modi/BJP supporter. Recently, with the Jamat news, we had a heated discussion where he actually suggested that he is in support of killing the offenders without a fair trial because some of them refused to give themselves up for COVID-19 testing. I obviously think that those who evade authorities are offenders and should be punished, but I also think that nobody has the right to unilaterally take someone else's life. Put them in a prison for the rest of their lives ffs, not kill them.

My dad says they'll make this a communal affair (as if he doesn't have deep-seated contempt for Muslims), so the entire judicial system should be done away with. He believes that the authorities should have all the rights without any checks. I tried to reason with him about why this is a slippery slip that leads to Nazism 2.0 or a suppressed population like in China, but he believes that China is a very ruthlessly efficient system that is for the greater good (!!!).

He also believes that the human rights violations against Uyghurs in China is acceptable (!!!) because, and I quote, ""they were trying to convert the Chinese to Islam,"" even though he has no evidence of that. Even if he did have strong evidence of something like that, and even if it was lawfully illegal somehow, I said that we still need a judicial system to rule it as unlawful. Does our judicial system have flaws? Of course, and I agree with my dad on that point, but instead of improving it to be faster and fairer, why remove it altogether and give absolute power to an already corrupt system?

I'm currently studying abroad in a Western country where I'm obviously a minority, so I naturally asked him if he'd support such authoritarianism if injustice was done to me, his son. I asked him if he'd be okay with a system that leaves me with no legal recourse for discrimination against a Hindu minority (me), but he basically evaded that question.

Authoritarianism works until it doesn't. Authoritarianism is cool as long as you agree with the people in power, but power corrupts and you soon have a system of oppression. Authoritarianism is okay as long as it doesn't affect you or your family.

How do I explain this to him? I'm considering never discussing politics with him for I adore and respect my dad and I'd hate to see our strong relationship degrade even a bit because of these things.

And then, this Tabliki Jamat incident came out and entire narrative shifted from 'everyone against corona virus to 'Indians against muslims spreading corona virus.

News channels are running shows day and night how Tabliki jamat members spread virus to remotest places in India. Actions of few Muslim people (Incident in indore and tiktok video of a guy from Malegaon) gave it more fire. 

This is going to have long term effects. Amount of hate that is being circulated on whatsapp groups, news channels, Twitter and other forums is going to last longer than this corona virus fiasco. Many of the people who were able to remain tolerant (yes I am using this word, because they were not liberal only tolerant) of the Muslim people only because they had business relations with them are now talking about cutting off ties with them. Already news are coming where there been attacks on masjid and doctors refusing to treat muslim women.

Please note, he said ' prevention and cure' and not 'treatment'. He said, 'cure' and not 'palliative treatment'. He said, 'cure' and not 'help reverse the effects'. 

> ""There is an institute in Bengaluru. They have found a yoga technique for prevention and cure of cancer. We have collected all documentation and the process is going on,"" Naik told reporters.

Please note that he said the 'cure' is already in the testing phase and will be approved within the year. Please note he said this is 2016. Please note that he said that the cure had been 'proved' - in 2016. 

> Mr. Naik said a technique for such cure developed by Bengaluru-based Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (S-VYASA) is just about a year away from endorsement from his Ministry.

Please note that the media mocked him and he never said it again, but he didn't apologise for giving India's 14 lakh cancer patients false hope. Remember this when you listen to his and his ministry's comments on coronavirus.

Politics,We would have gone into a recession regardless of a virus (PART RANT),81,fupeo0,abbawaddadu,21,"People seem to forget we already had major financial issues that no one is really highlighting. Such as the bad rollout of Demonetization, the ILFS issue leading to an NPA issue, the slow growth of the real estate industry in certain metropolitan areas. The consolidation of banks, the issues with Yes bank and the impending NBFC crisis. On top of it Air India's bad performance and a bunch of real issues that have happened over the past 5 years internationally such as the trade war, Brexit and currently the oil war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.

The Virus isn't something that would have wrecked the economy itself it's something that multiplying the impact of the already existing issues. The situation is right now not similar to 2008 because that situation was a fundamental shift in what we thought was right. This is a trust issue in the markets and economics. There is a mistrust between the stakeholders of commerce.

We will get out of this virus eventually and the markets will recover. The stock markets are drama queens that are sensitive to everything. If Trumps stupid words could trigger a downward trend, then imagine what would have happened if shit actually hit the fan. Remember all the loss of wealth is imaginary in sort as it's based on perceptions. You haven't actually lost the money as long as you don't book your losses. For a person who had invested 5-6 years back in a stock, he or she had lost an opportunity profit but nothing was ever promised. That's why all these instruments come with terms and conditions.

If a share falls by 30% that doesn't mean that a company with really good fundamentals and performance track will lose 30% of their intrinsic value over minutes. On the other hand if a company was extremely leveraged and had pre-existing skeletons in the closet, it""s going to be horrible for them. This time is more of a period of companies opening up and being honest about their positions and less of a China propoganda or lockdown bad thing.

It's sad to see people lose their jobs but it doesn't matter weather 1 million lose their jobs every year or 6 mill in one freak event but it was going to happen eventually. There is a fundamental demand side shock that has happened in India tracing far back as 2016. It's ironic that the enemies and black money hoarders of the economy, the informal sector, your vegetable vendors, your kirana shops your local chai walla, are currently the world managing and actually saving local district microeconomic commerce with their supply chains and flexibility. 

Right now the world is in an icu and we are paying a massive hospital bill not because of the disease but because of lack of investment in the essentials like infrastructure, healthcare and education. The investment was directed towards other fancier things because it seemed cool or a matter of izzat to do so at the time. I hope after all this is done people don't forget about the local kirana shops and supply chain guys who managed to keep things running.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fupeo0/we_would_have_gone_into_a_recession_regardless_of/

During the lockdown I was visiting my parents. We live in a large joint family setting. Now my every morning starts with Hindu Muslim hate speech as newspapers (Hindi) are read and tv news channels are put on loud. Of course they haven’t even subscribed to any remotely sane news channel. I isolate myself in a small room at the back of the house to get away from it but the shrill voice of frothing at the mouth anchors permeates everything. 
What’s worse is that after being fed their daily dose of toxicity, family members discuss it all day with glee. They call up other distant relatives and say stuff like “TJ ke bare mein suna apne? Gaddar hain ye log. Modi ji ko inhe chodna nahi chahiye. Inka ek hi ilaaj hai. Line mein khada karke goli maaro sabko”
Since yesterday, when news broke of some guy getting shot for saying TJ is behind coronavirus in India, they are targeting me with sarcastic and laced with toxicity pseudo-debates. Pseudo because they don’t really want to engage in discussion, they only want to humiliate me for my views. Maybe they secretly think I’m a gaddar too. 
I’m desperate to get out of this house and get back to my own home (another city) but I cannot till lockdown is lifted. Now it seems that it may not happen on 14th as planned earlier. I’m feeling so trapped and it’s disturbing my mental peace. I don’t know how to deal with so much toxicity and hate everyday day after day.

But whatever the reason is, one thing remains - that our country's conditions aren't good at all.

If you look  from a foreigners' perspective, India is now a hellhole. Its economy is in shambles, riots are breaking out all over India over the controversial acts of BJP like NRC, CAB, University fee hikes, etc., rape reports are rising with the recent brutal Telangana rape case, Kashmir has been in dark for 4 months now, internet shutdown has now become the norm of BJP and if your area is facing internet shutdown, its just another day in India.

He supported abrogation of Art 370 & didn't stand firm with his party's opinion along lines of democratic morals.

He couldn't survive 1 year without power. Surviving without position and power is an important trait of leadership. Some who lack ideology can't survive without it even for one year.

Scindia only has about 20 MLAs with him while Kamal Nath has over 90 MLAs supporting him. Why should Scindia have been made a CM over Kamal Nath.

Times like this makes me value Dr. Manmohan Singh. He would've made an empowered expert committee to guide the country through these tough times, answered questions and through honesty at least would've been reassuring at the wheels. 


Currently though, we have a man who likes the sound of his own voice, lies like there is no tomorrow, hasn't been in a single press conference for the last 6 years while claiming to be the representative of world's largest democracy, makes decisions on a whim based on raw (absent) wisdom, makes people believe in stupid shit(my relatives banged thalis with the zealous fury of a mindless disciple) and makes them do unnecessary and frankly, demeaning things without playing his part in the crisis and is scamming people out of their hard earned money during a time of crisis. A party which is using this virus to spread it's communal agenda. A finance minister who has no clue or authority to discharge her duties. A home minister who is cut off from reality and can hardly be bothered by the deaths and hardships of the masses (as can be expected from a psychopath. If he can murder Muslims, he can watch Hindus die too - A murderer is a murderer). A history graduate in RBI with a wet noodle for a spine. A society that is so frayed that the government doesn't command universal trust like it did earlier.


Dr. Singh, history will indeed judge you kindly. I hope the BJP, which is bereft of all intellect and is like a PR firm with no product, reach out to the opposition parties like Congress, TMC, CPIM, AAP which have quite a bit of expertise by Indian political standards. I hope that some voice of sanity and courage still remains in that cabinet of zombies.

People like you and me have plenty of surplus money and resources. There are people who literally completely depend on their next month's salary to run their houses. How do you think would they manage?

Government just abruptly closed down the entire nation. What arrangement did it make so that the poor reach their homes along with their familes safely? It is not as simple as booking a cab or renting a car for them. People are literally walking miles and miles to reach home. Why aren't these people being given masks, being scanned or being disinfected? People are being brutally tortured by the police.

Politics,How do you feel about boycotting companies for participating in events supported by other side of political spectrum?,57,emjrit,Monsultant,23,"This started with Bhakts giving bad ratings to Snapdeal because the Snapchat CEO was less than charitable when talking about India. Some people abused Rahul Bajaj for criticizing the scare-tactics of government. Now, I see the same behavior in bullying of Zoho owner and Accenture Chennai exec for agreeing to participate in an RSS event. This, in my opinion, is not different from several incidents where speakers from different side of political spectrum have been stopped from giving speeches in universities and other places.

Why is it so difficult for us to accept that there are other people with views differing to ours? Is there a need to personally go after every person who is against you and create an atmosphere where people are afraid of expressing their opinions? I found the criticism of Virat Kohli most amusing because of his refusal to give his views. Forget about opposing our stance, even not supporting our stance is supposedly a crime.

I am a liberal on most social issues in India (including CAA + NRC). But, I can live with certain celebrities or corporate executives supporting the government without boycotting their products and movies. I don't want a country where people are afraid of expressing their views in public. Certainly, the Modi fanatics were the first to start this atmosphere of fear on political topics (on topics like religion, this has always existed). I don't want to contribute to it.

# Q. Why I'm against a re-run of Ramayan and Mahabharat?

Let's start with this 1-minute clip from ""Shut up ya Kunal Episode 6 - Ravish Kumar""

1-minute clip: [https://imgur.com/a/btZMFpD](https://imgur.com/a/btZMFpD)

**Crowd manipulation** is the intentional use of techniques based on the principles of [crowd psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_psychology) to engage, control, or influence the desires of a crowd in order to direct its behavior toward a specific action.   This practice is common to religion, politics, and business and can facilitate the approval or disapproval or indifference to a person,  policy, or product.  

Sorry to say but I'm against every re-run or any show be it Ramayan or Circus starring Shah Rukh Khan. While you are busy watching these shows you will cry when Lord Ram is left stranded in a jungle and when his feet will hurt after walking so much but you won't pay attention that the poor are stranded on the roads and they have to walk hundreds of km without any food and they are crying because they know they are gonna die. People are accusing China of hiding the actual number of casualties, Well you have no idea what's coming your way. This is the reason why Supreme leader is coming daily and doing stupid live sessions to keep you engaged.

# Q. What's the psychology behind India-Pakistan and Nehru debates?

 Let me introduce you to ""BIG LIE"", A psychological trick.

Hitler's psychological profile:

>His primary rules were: never allow the public to cool  off; never admit a fault or wrong; never concede that there may be some  good in your enemy; never leave room for alternatives; never accept  blame; concentrate on one enemy at a time and blame him for everything  that goes wrong; people will believe a big lie sooner than a little one;  and if you repeat it frequently enough people will sooner or later  believe it.

The above quote appears in the report, *A Psychological Analysis of Adolph Hitler: His Life and Legend,* by [Walter C. Langer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Charles_Langer) 

>Never to admit a fault or wrong; never to accept blame;  concentrate on one enemy at a time; blame that enemy for everything that  goes wrong; take advantage of every opportunity to raise a political  whirlwind

This is why the Supreme leader never accepts a mistake and keeps pressing on Congress and specifically Congress for everything. IT cells never allows you to cool down. 

# The questions you should be asking: 

1. Why we are not ready to tackle COVID-19 when we had months to prepare? 
2. Why people are stranded on roads?
3. Why doctors don't have PPE kits?
4. Why permission to make COVID-19 test kits was given to a company from Gujrat instead of other 18 companies who claimed to manufacture these kits at a lower price.
5. Why Prime Minister missed the key points in his speech when he announced the Lockdown which created Panic in the country? 
6. Why they gave you only 3 hours to prepare for the lockdown why an immediate press conference was conducted? 
7. Why Centre allocates ₹20,000 crore to develop Lutyens’ Delhi amidst coronavirus crisis? 
8. Why we have not conducted enough tests? 
9. Why  Adityanath Govt Uses Epidemic Diseases Act to Arrest CAA Dissenter?
10. Why Dalits in Modi's constituency are eating grass in this lockdown? Why they don't have anything to eat?

Politics,Opinion of CAA from someone who avoids politics,20,eq0kr4,freezingganggang,10,"The decision of the government to allow non-muslim foreign immigrants from neighbouring countries is the most important decision of the year after modi again rose to power in may 2019. There has been a lot of mystery surrounding the act and what its consequences and the worry for the muslim community further increases by the decision to maintain a national registry for which it seems necessary to prove your origin through documents which can be difficult for a lot of people.

A question arises that why the government felt it was necessary to implement such a clearly controversial decision. There was never a need for such a bill that invites immigrants from other countries and the modi government has previously never shown any interest in the hindus in the neighboring countries. So is the decision just a move towards making india a place reserved for just hindus by discriminating against the muslim community. As they couldn’t directly discriminate against the muslims on the basis of just religion as we claim to be a secular country and that would have been a direct war against the constitution so they decided to remove muslims exclusively from an important decision of the government which does not directly affect the common person of the country. So is this decision the first part of the plan of the modi government to radicalize the people to turn against the people of our own country just because they don’t follow the same religion as us. Is modi really such a petty thinker that he would waste the energy and resources of our nation to just push his Hindutva agenda instead of focusing on more important world issues at hand.

After the bill was silently introduced and quickly passed the government has been sitting in the back seat and are letting the events pan out as they can. The top level is not answering any questions and neither are raising new ones by acting as the decision is a good and fair and are letting the people of the country go up against one another. There has been a huge opposition to the act as any thinking person wouldn’t go up against the rights of other people just on small difference but the government has a lot of loyal followers who wouldn’t even dare to criticize the governments decision and the government expends a lot of energy to keep them on their side by circulating propaganda and diverting the issues so they are always in the good light.

But this just feels like the modi government is trying to rise in power and gain more control over the country and we can just wait for his next move and judge the true intention of the government whether it is power or just a more hindu state. So the next four years will be a fight between the common man vs the government and we can just hope that we have the will power to fight it to the end and have the sense to understand the plight that can fall on our fellow men if we fail to do so.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eq0kr4/opinion_of_caa_from_someone_who_avoids_politics/

Politics,How deep does the hatred for Muslims go in Indian society?,267,fbvox4,Pessimist-Indian,175,"Met a hindu friend yesterday who runs a business in a small-town that has decent Muslim population (\~20%). He told me all the good things about how he has close Muslim friends. How he COMPULSARILY has to visit 3 of his friend's house for feast during Eid. How when he was looking for partners to play Badminton, most hindu groups didn't take him in but the Muslim guys welcomed him with open arms. How he is welcome into their homes where other men cannot go, (meaning they consider like a family member). So when he told me all this, I expected he will have empathy towards the sufferings of the Muslims since he is close to so many. 

But as you'd have guessed by now, he was a Modi supporter with strong distrust towards Muslims. Although he claimed he is not against them (proof that he has so many close Muslim friends) but he felt they are extremely fanatic (kattar). I kept asking have they ever forced you or anyone to do anything against their wish. If not how can they be fanatic. Whatever their problems it is within their community. He strongly believes Muslims have 'enjoyed' the appeasement politics for many years and got so many benefits. How they want to have 4-5 kids to increase their population. He felt all Muslims should have gone to Pakistan during partition. You know, the usual stuff.

If this is how someone who has close Muslim friends thinks, then what can we say about the majority who have very little connection with Muslims. Every day, every conversation just goes onto solidify my belief that it is impossible to overcome this hate. We will either go the Germany way or the Israel way. Either way the future is not looking good.

### Tl;dr

IFF has written an open letter to Justice A.P. Shah and shared a copy of it with the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). In it we have expressed our concerns of self censorship beginning to permeate across online video platforms. We have sent this as a response to three recent developments. First, the Government filed a counter affidavit before the Supreme Court last month in which it endorsed self-regulatory institutional mechanisms for domains like social media. Second, the Minister of Information & Broadcasting Prakash Javadekar met with industry players setting a 100 day timeline for market participants to agree on a code of conduct and adjudicatory mechanism. Third, Hotstar India’s largest online curated content providers banned an episode of Last Week Tonight which dedicated an 18 minute segment to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Therefore, we have written to Justice Shah to take cognizance of these developments and the risk the IAMAI’s self regulation code poses to people’s right to receive and impart information.

### Background

In early February 2020, the Internet and Mobile Association of India launched a new Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers. Among other things it sought to establish a second tier oversight mechanism under the aegis of a Digital Content Complaint Council (“DCCC”). The DCCC has been constituted in a manner which is eerily similar to the Broadcast Content Complaints Council (“BCCC”) which is the relevant self-regulatory oversight mechanism for television in India. Notably, the BCCC and the accompanying self-regulation code operates parallel to statutorily recognised content norms for cable television. When such parallel frameworks subsist it is likely that content creation, removal and censorship decisions err on the side of caution. As we all know, India’s TV ecosystem has aligned itself to be a risk averse space where content remains homogeneous and its quality pales in comparison to global creative economies.

We have studied the IAMAI’s self regulation framework and many of the same problems that we see with respect to TV come up in this context as well. It establishes vague prohibited content norms which go beyond constitutional thresholds and provisions under relevant laws like the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860. In addition we are concerned with the way that the framework has been designed in an exclusionary manner, the scope and applicability of the DCCC and its interactions with government in particular, and limited actual considerations of the public’s right to free speech and expression.

We believe it is likely to translate into a paradigm where there will be excessive self censorship which will plague India’s online content space. At a broader level we believe it will lead to an overarching chilling effect which will mean that certain types of content will not get made and it will lead to a body blow for plurality and diversity in India’s fledgling online content ecosystem. Sensing these concerns we have already written to the [**IAMAI** ](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/)and the touted chairperson of the proposed DCCC, the former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, [**Justice A.P. Shah**](https://internetfreedom.in/a-gentle-open-letter-to-justice-a-p-shah-on-the-online-video-self-regulatory-code/). In it we have articulated our aforementioned concerns with the framework.

Subsequent developments since then reinforce our trepidation with the DCCC and the IAMAI’s self regulation code. To be sure, the Code has only five signatories who have developed the code in conjunction with the IAMAI in an opaque manner-- with no inputs from external stakeholders. The exclusionary nature of the Code is magnified by the fact that the online curated content space in India has more than 35 payers. Therefore, it is concerning that the Indian Government has started taking steps to formalise industry wide adoption and endorse such parallel frameworks which fuel self censorships.

### Latest Developments

In an ongoing matter on online content regulation, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) filed a counter affidavit filed before the Supreme Court of India. In it MIB [**endorsed**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/self-regulation-model-may-work-for-ott-companies-govt/articleshow/74410087.cms) a self-regulatory institutional mechanism for other domains like social media. This concerns us because it seems like there is a slippery slope brewing which could lead to a chilling effect spreading across major online platforms (both which are fully curated and those which are semi-curated).

Additionally, a [**report**](https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/curb-your-ott-instincts/articleshow/74449516.cms) in the Mumbai Mirror dated March 03, 2020 revealed that the Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Mr Prakash Javadekar met with online content industry representatives. In the meeting, the Minister gave the representatives a 100-day timeline by when they must arrive at a consensus on an industry code of conduct and an appropriate adjudicatory mechanism. This is clearly indicative of a risk that the Government may be pushing other segments of the industry to become signatories to the IAMAI Code and come under the jurisdiction of the DCCC. If this happens we could be fast heading to a restrictive online content space along the lines of how it functions in the Indian television ecosystem.

Our concerns self-censorship were of course exacerbated by the recent incident in which Hotstar, one of the primary signatories to the IAMAI’s self regulation code, proactively [**banned**](https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hotstar-blocks-john-olivers-last-week-tonight-episode-criticising-narendra-modi/article30920096.ece) an episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver which was centred on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

### What have we written?

Given these multiple developments we have written to Justice A.P. Shah outlining these incidents and how it ties up with our stance on the IAMAI self-regulation code. We have urged the concerned parties to revisit their current positions and will follow up with them to consider avenues through which self-regulation does not become a gateway to trample upon people’s freedom of speech and expression, overall creativity, diversity and plurality. To this end, we have shared with both Justice Shah and the IAMAI Governing Council links to a recent report by [**Access Now**](https://www.accessnow.org/guide-how-to-protect-human-rights-in-content-governance/) which looks at different models of online content governance. The report also examines self-regulation and outlines certain key principles in ensuring such systems do not violate human rights.

IFF will continue to continue to engage with the subject, and fight towards ensuring self-regulation does not become a means for collateral censorship.

Politics,Need advice for work politics,8,fbpugf,sufiyana7313,0,"Keeping it as short as I can. Please bear with me. 

I worked in a company for three years while I was approached by the current one. They persuaded me a lot to join and casually agreed to work on my terms. Lately, I was pushed into leading the domain I didnt sign up for. I was hired as the head of business development in terms of building relations. However, I have been pushed into being sales head. Given this shift and constant salary delays, I have been meaning to quit but decided to give it a couple more months 

But what followed recently was a shocker when my HR out of nowhere calls and tells me that they dont want me to continue. I was extremely furious with management as they directly persuaded me but chose to tell me through HR without even intimating about any issue. 

Upon further discussion with my COO, it turns out that it wasn't my performance or work, which they thankfully are very content with. It was coworkers saying shit about me that led him to assume and believe that I am degrading the office culture which was a shocker to me. 


Few points on the topic - 

1. My colleagues came to me with a work problem in hysterical and stressed states. 

For ex, I feel underpaid and stuff. To which I gave the suggestion to compile the work and highlight your skills and then have a one on one meeting with hr and management to justify the raise. 

This was portrayed to my management as me trying to demotivate people and pushing them to ask for raise. 


2. My CEO asked my HR to validate. She never spoke to me and gave me the reason as performance based issues for firing. Further told my CEO that she has validated the same with everyone else in the company and based on this he decided to let me go. 


3. I am the last person to gossip and been very out front in terms of my opinions. 



Have a discussion with my CEO tomorrow. Can anyone shed some light on how to deal with this. He doesn't want me to leave in terms of work but doesn't want a ""negative source"" in his team.

Politics,Can India change following COVID-19?,23,fr1arf,_drimzy,20,"This question is specifically for the youth of India (people in the 18-45 age range)! Is this our wake up call? Are we gonna recover from this and become a different country? A country of innovators who actually work to make the country better, instead of slaving away for MNCs creating fake digital lives? A country with strong fundamentals where the officials are accountable. Where we ask questions to the state. Where the government becomes the serving class and not the ruling class they currently are! Where we discuss fundamentals before voting and stop caring about Hindus and Muslims and caste and creed?

What can the next generation of entrepreneurs do to make our fundamentals and basics strong? And by fundamentals I mean absolute fundamentals. Like clean water, electricity, food supply network, medicine, hospitals and infrastructure (roads and trains) and education in every single village. I don’t care about the entrepreneurs who make dev tools to help enterprises collaborate better. Yes you serve a purpose, but you are serving the top 5-10% and your efforts would never uplift the laborers that are walking home 100s of Kms. We need our youth to unite and rebuild India. We have to get into drone deliveries, rapid road construction technologies, autonomous trucks, bio technology and what not! We won our independence more than 70 years ago, and have for too long relied on foreign countries to uplift us and our economy. It’s time we take action! If you are educated and can read and go to work for an MNC, you owe it to your future generations to invent after you get home.

I am at loss for ideas on how to start rebuilding my country. But I know we have to get up and start building! (Of course not now. Let this calm down, and start in 3 months. Stay the fuck home right now!)",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fr1arf/can_india_change_following_covid19/

Politics,"NO, Google's and apple's CEO are not INDIANS",498,ey61pg,aradhya23,117,"We often feel very proud when we see Indian origin people leading big companies like Google, and Apple; we feel as if it was because of their upbringing that they are on that stage. Truth to be told, they being on that position had no connection with them being born in India. 

If you look at the stats, 17% of total world population is in India. Which basically means that every 6th person is actually Indian. If India really needs to compete on global level, first we need to achieve this number. Every 6th Medal in Olympics should go to an Indian, every 6th Nobel prize should go to Indian, every 6th billionaire should be Indian, every 6th successful start-up should be from India. 
But in practical world, we are not even close to this number. We are, in fact getting worse every day. 

Sometime ago, Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, was criticized heavily when he said ""Indians are not creative""; I really understand why he said so now. We have almost same population as China, but their economy is 5 times greater than ours. Chinese have big markets of their own, they have grown their own technology, a new environment all together.
Our population is estimated to grow to 170 crores by 2050; in no way we have enough resources to sustain such a huge amount of people. With more and more automation coming every day, most of the already existing jobs are just on the brick of going extinct. 

In India not only do we have crises in allocation of funds; but the corruption at grass root level is disturbing.  
In the last three decades, India’s economy has grown, but most of this growth can be attributed to significantly improved access to the western world and its technology through the new medium of internet and cheap telephony. The low-hanging fruit from this have been plucked and India is starting to show signs of stagnation. 

Unless and until there is a major change in the critical thinking of the people in power, the future of this youth driven country looks very dim.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ey61pg/no_googles_and_apples_ceo_are_not_indians/

A medical scientist researching Infectious Disease, for the US Government in Houston who was my classmates in college.

And our friendships are equally deep after his departure to America.

Got a call from him.

His first sentence was,

""Devendra Ji,

* Our PM Modi is some great man, probably.

I said

""Hey, he is, but what did he do now?""

He said, ""We have been doing research in India for the last 30 years on Infectious Disease, but this idea of 1 day curfew never came to our mind.""

I asked, ""Are you also making fun of Modi like seculars, leftists, Muslims, Thukde Thukde Gang, Urban Naxalites, Award Returning Gangs, AAP, NDTV etc in India?""

He said, ""Oh nothing like that, I and my whole family have been citizens of America for 19 years, My annual salary is more than 15 crores in Indian rupees, But the hearts are still Indian.

Every major step and decision of Modi is completely separated from politics, I wish the welfare of India and human beings I also saw Lakhs of Indians are making fun of Modi's 1 day self-imposed curfew, But in our laboratory, a 45-minute official meeting of all the big scientists has just been convened to discuss this announcement of Modi.

You would be surprised, this 45-minute meeting lasted for more than 3 hours, with a 1-day self-imposed curfew to discuss contagious diseases and its impact on Covid 19 in particular,

All scientists were of the opinion that, 12 hours is a very effective way to prevent the spread of corona virus by cutting every person from the world, Because Covid cannot survive for more than 12 hours on any surface outside the human body.

In such a situation, being cut off from the outside world, inanimate objects such as door handles, Currency notes, files, courier parcels, Steering wheels of vehicles Viruses on pens etc. will be completely eliminated, And without spending a single penny in this manner as suggested by Modi, Since there is no loss of work due to Sunday,

* The country will be almost free from viruses! * These ideas were not thought of in the minds of the world's highest level scientists of this subject

If any of his advisors has given this advice to Modi then this person is entitled to the Nobel Prize, and if the great idea is the brainchild of Modi, then he should get the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his contribution in the medical field of Infectious Disease. ""*

I could not even speak a word.

I have some ideas to make this debate to the points. These ideas seem impossible but are not. Ofcourse even if we try to make it happen, they won't agree to it, because they cannot stand the truth.  

• Get Modi, Shah and Ajay Bisht in the same room with Ramachandra Guha, Azad, Sadaf Jafar, Kanhaiya, Dhruv Rathee, etc.  

• Exclude TV journalists. Bik gaye hai ye log.  

• Have a team from Altnews or some expert Google users who know how to search for stuff on the internet. To immediately fact check Modi, Shah and Ajay Bisht's statements and if it's false, prove it to them on the spot. If it's true, I'm sure we can find something to counter it.

Politics,"[serious] COVID-19, Help me here! where am i going wrong? (Please - I am not trying to create a panic.)",26,g01wpp,sanjeev-v,28,"too long but please read. please do not panic over this as i may be a dumbass.

The [Mortality rate of Covid-19 in India](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/indias-covid-19-death-rate-lower-than-many-developed-nations-like-us-uk-medical-experts/articleshow/75084199.cms)  is 3.05, according to this [article](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/indias-covid-19-death-rate-lower-than-many-developed-nations-like-us-uk-medical-experts/articleshow/75084199.cms).

The mortality rate in US is about 3.57, in Italy around 12 and in UK it's more than 12.(according to the above article)

so about 3 people die per 100 cases in India. It's scary! but not too much.

currently, mortality rate is calculated by number of death per number of cases .

    mortality rate = Total Death / Total cases

currently in world, **1,806,436** active cases and **111,722** deaths.(the curve is nowhere near flat)

mortality rate = 111722/1806436 = 6.18% worldwide.

so about 6 people die per 100 cases worldwide. It's scary! still not too much.

let's assume an [infection rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu) of 20% (20 percent of population would get infected in a span of [2 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu#/media/File:1918_spanish_flu_waves.gif)). 25% is the infection rate for Spanish influenza and it didn't spread to many country as covid-19, the social distancing was not that great before and there were [three waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu#/media/File:1918_spanish_flu_waves.gif).

&#x200B;

now, 20% of 7.7 billion people is 1.4 billion (very huge) and 6% of 1.4 billion is 84 million(estimated death toll). 

realistically, if the infection rate is brought down to 1%(by social distancing, lock-down, etc) the death toll would still be 4.2 million. (stay the f\*ck inside home, seriously)

&#x200B;

now, my real panic is that the current mortality rate calculation takes total active cases into account( the people who got infected and are still in hospital waiting for outcome.) eventually these people will either die or get cured.

Doesn't it make sense that we should only consider the cases which had outcome for mortality rate calculation?

    mortality rate = total dead / (total discharged or cured+total dead)

In this case, 

current mortality rate = 111,722 / (413,222+111,722) = 21.3% (that's huge) (numbers from [worldometer](https://imgur.com/a/E2HZnAI))

this changes everything.

now, if the infection rate is 1%(more likely estimate) the death toll would be 16.4 million.(holy f\*uck)

which makes this one of the worst pandemics in history. 

In [India](https://imgur.com/a/vOkmjyH), 

mortality rate = 331/(1080+331) = 23.45% (which is very high, above world mean) (why are scientists saying we have low mortality rate?)

Did gov officials know about this?  or they know and they are keeping it silent to not cause any panic?

BTW, the actions taken by Indian gov is by far the best in the world.(as far as i researched) . they did bring down the infection rate by a huge factor.

&#x200B;

please help me with these questions:

* Am i doing the calculation correct or did i miss any variable? 
* Does India have huge asymptomatic cases, which were not reported?
* How did china contain this? did china actually contain this or lying about the numbers? 
* because the numbers in china are nowhere close to other countries. their mortality rate (by second method - only calculating outcomes) is 4% while for the rest of the world is 21%. it never crossed 5% at any time(very suspicious). Their mortality rate is low all the way? why all the country have similar curve except china? 
* why India is relying on Chinese model in containing this Virus?  **India should not follow Chinese model** to contain this problem.(i know medical students who are lazy to do their maths). 
* how is it possible for China to contain this as the infection rate is very high .R0 = 2.2 for covid-19, based on Chinese study  for comparison seasonal flu in USA, has an R0 of 1.3 and roughly kills about 25,000 to 75,000 - 34,200 in 2018/19 (remember that this is the rate for an exponential graph).[chinese study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/) ,  for comparison seasonal flu in USA, has an R0 of 1.3 and roughly kills about 25,000 to 75,000 - [34,200 in 2018/19](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html) (remember that this is the rate for an exponential graph).
* how can we model this in India? will India be f\*ucked if there were a community spread?

Can we get some volunteers who can send me materials on how to model this properly? I know data science, i can make a website. with your help i can make some valuable prediction on how this will unfold and will give you that information for free.

Politics,"Are people(especially men) really okay with with their partner's past history(boyfriends, sexual)? or are they just afraid of being labelled backward/prudish, or just want to fit in(with liberals/pseudo-liberals)?",7,fx71yh,curiouspupil,105,"Note: I am not saying this should apply to only women. same applies to men too (you can reverse the genders in below). it is not right that women need not worry about their husbands past(they can and should)

A little background: I am a bit on the introverted spectrum, I live in a little bubble(not much contact/info on what goes around, especially people's lives or how the trends are currently). My parents are searching for brides(arranged marriage, I am now 29). I always thought its the guys(not all, but most) are pigs and would be ready to drop their pants without any serious commitments. And, girls like to keep their honor(even - sex only after marriage or serious commitment). I understand that this is how our parents were and may not be the case currently, but still I thought at least a good number of girls will never go into casual relatiionships/boyfriends(with intimacy involved). Even if they did have, I thought it would be to just get a validation among peers(and would never get into intimacy). But, wow!, was I totally wrong. It appears most of the girls (especially in metros) definetely would have had at least one or two boyfriends(with no serious commitment in mind and ready/wanting to have intimacy).

**I came to this conclusion after doing a little research(got curious and paranoid too), asked around very few people I know(men and women, and even the homely, next door girl types, or are they!?) and read articles, and answers from Quora. To my surprise not even single one wanted to oppose this or think it is wrong, i.e it is okay to have casual relatiionships/boyfriends(with intimacy involved) and no need to wait for someone special without getting intimate or savor the joy of being your partner's first and last(and being your partner's first and last)**, they all nodded that it is admirable and great, but didnt give it much importance, said - you shouldnt be like that(and that I shouldnt expect so, not in a - ""hey, its not practical man"" way, but in a ""you just cant"" way). When asked if I can at least ask the girl upfront(in a polite, non-condescending/non-judgemental way), the reply always was - no, you cant ask that, your partner's past is none of your concern.

I still can understand above from their point of view, its your life, who am I to judge how should one live. But when I asked would you not feel bad/hurt after learning your wife's/husband's past(especially sexual) after marriage(most of these are married recently, I could have at least understood if it was a long marriage and they are an aged couple and they bonded very much enough to get past this), the reply always was - no it does not bother me, even the ones that didnt have any/much past(especially men!!, thats a surprise). I for one cannot understand this. **It appears I am the only one who is unable to digest the fact that the person I am going to share my life with did things with someone else. I am not saying it is end of the world, but at least it appears a big deal to me, not something I can just forget/get-past-it easily.**

**My questions are -**

1. Am I the only who cant digest/is-very-much-uncomfortable-with my wouldbe's past? I am okay if that is really the case(not all are made different, or maybe I didnt evolve much according to current standards/ways. no pun intended, i mean it, it may very well be true)
2. If I am not the only one, i.e many are like me too, why are they saying so? are they afraid of being labelled backward/prudish?
3. or, am I just plain wrong?, i.e grass is indeed greener, its just that I am getting info from wrong sources or small demographic and I am just being paranoid?
4. Why are these people supporting this? they just dont like the idea(or have no interest in or felt does not make sense at all)?, or just want to make most out of life(i.e enjoy as much as you can before marriage)?. no judgement here, if thats how they want to live, fine they can live it that way, just trying to understand the reality/truth.

Please dont label me as backward/prudish, I am actually very open minded(to some extent, apparently :) ) and I believe in liberal values(free spech, equality, questioning things rather than just blindly believing etc..). and I am not mysogynist either. Just because someone is male, he shouldnt think he is better or deserve things than females(my case still applies if you reverse the genders). and its not just about gender, it applies to race/intellectuality/status etc.. too (it is a horrible thing for me to descriminate on these basis).

And sorry for the long post..just felt more details might help understand better.

&#x200B;

PS:

By intimacy i mean getting physical. first base - no surprise there, expected, but even second/third base and even home run in most cases.

And I am not saying all are like that, but to me it appears majority are like that, but then again I might be wrong(I am happy to stand corrected)

Its not because I wanted to get any action but couldnt(due to inability or some other factors), so I dont want my partner to have what I couldn't. That would only makes me a hypocrite. (I am not a stud nor attractive, I didnt get many encounters, just had two(or maybe not!?), got tempted, but refrained, not even because of morals, but thought it would be unfair with the expectations I have on my partner)

And no judgement at all, I practice live and let live(if it sounded so, I didnt mean it, i am happy to correct it). I just wanted to understand what the reality/truth is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fx71yh/are_peopleespecially_men_really_okay_with_with/

Indian politics is now in a new phase where your 'Party face' matters more than your party or your ideology",23,f29in8,ParmanuMan,1,"As the final results trickle in, exit polls have been proven true that a quarter of bjp and Congress voters have switched to 'kejriwal' in Delhi elections. AAP knew that Kejriwal's popular image is their biggest strength and they used it perfectly. From a campaign centered around kejriwal (""lage raho kejriwal"") to posing this question to Delhi voters :**""kejriwal vs who""**.

Gone are the days when a party enjoys blind loyalty just because of past history. As the opposition recovers from 2019 drubbing at hands of modi, it seems that they have realised that any election campaign now requires a strong and popular leader to anchor their campaign.

All the elections in which bjp have been defeated in past few years have one thing in common, the opposition had a strong regional leader

* rajasthan : sachin pilot

* karnataka : siddaramiah (Congress got more votes than bjp)

* Odisha : naveen patnaik

* punjab : captain Amarinder Singh

* maharashtra : sharad pawar (Congress pretty much gave up in maharashtra and didn't even bother campaigning while sharad pawar was doing rallies even in heavy rains)

* Jharkhand : Hemant soren

* telangana : KCR

* Tamil nadu : stalin

* Andra pradesh : Jagan


Indian voters are smart. Political pandits think that the average voter is an idiot who can't distinguish between state and national elections.

In not even a single state election has bjp managed to even come close to their national vote share. People know that modi won't be resigning as PM and coming to their state. Moreover, state elections are fought on different issues and environment than national elections. This was clear in Delhi where while bjp was going on a rampage about shaheen bagh, 50% of the voters didn't even know about it, while the rest didn't understand or care ahout it.

In order to save the friendship, I don’t talk crap about what media/govt/police is doing, because everyone is violent right now, all I’m asking for is peace. But he doesn’t stop, it’s mostly a one sided argument, when he talks about Muslims. Should I sacrifice the friendship and shut him down because oh boy I can.

Politics,Rant - Dumbwits branding people as bigots who criticize the clapping,143,fng93i,yazz276,27,"I saw a meme which made an analogy where Indians were heartened to see Italians clapping showing their solidarity and when we did it ourselves, we saw it as an embarrassment.

1. This whole idea of clapping on one side might help in boosting morale. However, it's just a distraction by the government which has no proper plan of action, lack of testing centres, kits, per capita hospital beds, economic measures for the low class people, etc.

2. Italians were clapping because they were enthralled by the service of medical professionals who are trying their best to contain the situation for the past 2 months. It is this government which cut down the health budget by 20 % when it came to power (https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/india-slashes-health-budget-already-one-of-the-world-s-lowest/)
and has shown contempt in the past, asking us all to clap for their service. Ffs, we don't even have a data in a realist sense and the whole drill failed when lakhs of Indians took this shit to the streets and roads and defied the entire purpose of social distancing. 

3. I'm M20. I'm appalled to see friends from my same age group who mindlessly forward these Whatsapp texts which claim clapping to boost immunity and they themselves arguing it is an ""energy medicine"". Clearly these people don't have the scientific temperament, which even the Constitution requires us to do so.

4. One guy even told me to focus on what lies ahead instead of dwelling on the past when I cited how lethargic the government has been in the past with regard to healthcare sector and implementing testing measures in the wake of the virus. I'm just dumbfounded by this argument that I should not talk about what happened already. When all hells break loose, I'll send the same shit to him again.

5. Another bhakt asked me how am I helping in complaining about the government measures. He didn't reply back when I asked him how clapping would help.

I'm sorry about the long rant but I wanted to vent it all out since most of my friends are least interested in having a discussion/argument as it requires a brain or they are already brainwashed by the gimmicks of politicians.

Photography,[SERIOUS] How would people in India react if someone started posting erotic/implied nude photography on Instagram?,9,dc6k28,desikid25,20,"PS: I’m going to be as specific as possible so people here can actually tell how others, specially my friends, college teachers etc might react. I’ve also added serious tag so that the replies don’t turn into sarcastic/joke types. 

I’m an Indian guy in my mid twenties working abroad. I like to do photography as a hobby in my free time although art of any form but mainly paintings and movies have always been something I’ve been very interested in. Lately I started shooting female portraits which involves mostly European and sometimes Asian women. I post all my work on Instagram where my friends and even teachers from school follow me.

So far my friends and colleagues etc have been really appreciating my photos. Some of them were very impressed since I do feel my photos are good and stand out. Surprisingly I’ve received better feedback from my female friends.

Now I’m thinking of starting erotic/boudoir photography which involves women in very less clothing. Some of that also involves nude women where nudity is implied i.e. breasts hidden by hand etc (no frontal nudity). Something along the lines of playboy shoots. I have couple of shoots already planned with two  European girls.

I’m not someone who cares much about what others think but I’m a bit concerned if this is going to have a bad impact on me in any way that I am unaware of. I mean any way this can have a bad effect. In terms of reputation or how people may react or perceive me etc. I’m especially not sure how Indian people would react to this and if I’m going to be viewed in a negative way.

Photography,Visiting India,10,es78p7,casey_h6,9,"Hello everyone,

I am going to be visiting India soon for a business trip. I will be meeting up with our business friend, which is the reason for my visit. We will be in New Delhi, and I just have some random miscellaneous questions and I would enjoy talking to actual Indians instead of reading someone's travel blog. Above all, I want to make sure I'm not disrespectful to anyone.

Firstly, I am interested in doing some photography of my time here, both of the incredible buildings and of the culture. Is it considered disrespectful to do what we call ""street photography"" which is essentially taking pictures of the things, buildings, and people while walking around? What is the locals attitude towards a white guy like me walking around taking photographs?

Secondly, what are some good places to visit near New Delhi? I believe we will be going to the taj Mahal, and I would also like to go to red fort, humayuns tomb, etc. I know these are touristy, but I'm coming across the world and would like to see them.

If anyone has any questions for me I'd love to talk as well, it's always interesting to learn about others culture.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/es78p7/visiting_india/

Photography,I started my Btech degree yesterday at the age of 25.,2230,ciddbn,fuckyallmat,462,"For those who are ashamed of going for their bachelor's after the age of 21, I started my btech degree at the age of 25. Sure the Indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isn't encouraged at such ""old age"" by societies standards, but I took the plunge. Here's my backstory - I graduated high school in 2012. Scored a rank of 718 in Wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.
I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. 
I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)


Thanks,


Failure at 25.

Photography,Watching movies in India is a truly unique experience.,131,dcqkjk,sleepygamer92,54,"Seriously, there is no dearth of weird shit that can happen. I went to watch Joker in an afternoon show and here is a list of things that happened.

1. Some guys came with Heath Ledger type facepaint and saste ka clown masks. They were denied entry because they didn't have ID to prove they were above 18. This bunch of Joker ""anarchists"" was then seen begging the security to let them in.

2. I overheard a guy was telling his girlfriend that Heath Ledger would make a cameo in this movie. I thought he was pranking her but he seemed to be convinced.

3. Another group of people (who I had the unfortunate experience of sitting next to later) were chanting anarchy slogans as they entered the theater. They were asked to shut up by the ushers. These same bunch proceeded to take videos and photos of ""iconic"" clips from the movie, sometimes with their flash on. Thankfully they were thrown out.

4. Someone's family member apparently died/hospitalized in the climax of the movie and he began crying loudly while on the call. He ran out after a few seconds but some people who were next to him were genuinely confused about whether to ask him to shut up or not.

5. I spotted a celebrity photographer in the theater watching the movie with his wife. I used to love his early work and it sort of inspired me into getting into amateur photography. I was contemplating throughout the movie what I will say to him or will he be cool to take a picture with me etc. I had them locked on while they were exiting and ended up standing right next to them in the dark exit hallway walking out. As I was about to talk to him, he and his wife started having an argument. I just continued walking past them and left thanks to the awkwardness.

Thoughts about the movie? It's great. Just try going for a show where you can avoid the college crowd. Dunno why these people worship The Joker.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dcqkjk/watching_movies_in_india_is_a_truly_unique/

Photography,What are photography laws in India for public places?,37,3toad9,PracticallyaMan,27,"I just got into an argument with my friends who were under the impression that it is illegal to take photographs of a person without their permission even in a public place. I was dazed by their belief and their view of morality regarding that. Shortly after they withdrew from the conversation, refusing to talk further and leaving me frustrated.

 I could find only a little information concerning the matter on internet. And I have a lot of questions now. There doesn't seem to be any unified concrete law for photography. If there is one please let me know. 

An important article I found [here](http://blog.sujitshetty.com/2009/04/photographers-rights-in-india.html) has this information
>Passengers are now also permitted to take photographs from inside an aircraft while in flight or landing/take off at civil aerodromes. 

Which reminds me of the [arrest of 3 for taking picture of air hostesses](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/hindu-mahasabha-functionary-among-3-arrested-for-taking-pictures-of-air-hostesses-in-indigo-flight/)

Now I am not saying whether it was morally justified to take her photos when she clearly objected, but I am questioning whether it is illegal. So if I go to a public park and take a photo of a woman, does she have the power to put me into jail if I don't delete the photos on her request?

In the aforementioned case, the persons were charged under *IPC Section 354*(assault or criminal force to **woman** with intent to outrage her modesty) and under the *Sexual Harassment of* ***Women*** *at Workplace* (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act. 

This brings me to another question, is taking pictures of a woman without consent an act of sexual harassment? And what would have been the charges if the flight attendant was a man instead of a woman?

Photography,[Career Advice] Exploring opportunity in IT sector.,11,d0jtpf,PotentialPermit,8,"Hi fellow Indians. 

I would like your advice on prospective career development in IT sector. Though I am already working in field of art - photography, graphic designing, video editing etc. I am now looking for something new in IT as it has always been something that I am being recommended since past 20 years so thought why not give it a go. Those who are already in this field, please let me know what are my options. 

Let me first tell you about myself so that you may know where I stand right now and where should I begin. 

• I love learning about new technology, how it works, whats going on in background etc. I do easily figure out behind the scenes of a hardware or software by using it for a while or maybe after a bit of research. That’s why I am good at troubleshooting because I can easily identify the fault and works towards it and don’t even hesitate to go into rabbit hole if the problem demands it. 

• I also am a bit of tinkerer and like to develop my own things like using raspberry pi to make ot into my door opener, use it as DNS blocker (/r/pihole), make it into my own Alexa device, hosting my own websites and hardening the security of it etc. And now a days I am tinkering with NodeMCU to use it for home automation using the HomeKit by Apple. 

• Speaking of Apple, I love breaking the boundaries set by it in their iOS and do more than an average user (/r/Jailbreak). Because of things I mentioned in first point, I am also good at troubleshooting unique problems that only I am facing due to the combinations of tweaks I made in the system.

• Although I can understand most of the code and figure out the problem/BTS, modify it a bit according to my preference but I can not code the whole thing myself. 

Please let me know if this is enough to begin with or should I learn more before even thinking about any course or training. Also based on my information, what are my options and where should I start. 

If you are still reading, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking out time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d0jtpf/career_advice_exploring_opportunity_in_it_sector/

Photography,Why do people spend years preparing for civil service exams?,77,bh942l,ripple_guy,75,"A few months back I visited my friend who was preparing for civil service exams. The guy was preparing for the fourth consecutive year and I feel even this year he couldn't clear it so probably he would prepare again. It has been four years since we graduated from college and it is extremely difficult for me to understand how people can trade the prime years of there life for just preparing for an exam.

There is one thing called passion. I understand someone who is very passionate about say Programming, Photography, Acting etc and spends years trying to build a product, improve his photography or get a good acting role respectively. It is because these people probably are doing what they like and there is no better way of spending your 20s in my opinion. 

But preparing for civil services for such a long amount of time seems like a complete waste of time to me. People don't know what it is like to be an IAS/IPS/IES etc. They are spending so many years in their youth cramming for an exam without even knowing what it is like to be one of those things. And during this time most people have absolutely no life. I asked my friend about his daily routine and what he does on weekends etc and I was surprised how he could spend these years like that which were devoid of much human interaction, adventure, traveling, making money or doing anything that you would have good memories about down the line.

By the way, I am not questioning civil services or people preparing for that. There is nothing wrong with that. I am just asking why people continue doing it for so long when they fail the first one or two times when they don't even know if they'd like the actual job or not. I feel it is an utter waste of time even if you become an IAS after say your sixth attempt by which time you'd have spent six most prime years of your life doing absolutely nothing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bh942l/why_do_people_spend_years_preparing_for_civil/

Photography,[SERIOUS] I am stuck with my career and could use some guidance on what to do next. I am genuinely lost.,18,cm92t0,throwaway_gd92,8,"This is a long post and I cannot tl;dr it because I need to explain my situation. Sorry about that!

&#x200B;

So I am a 27-year-old who is a graphic designer by profession. I have been in this domain for 4 years and I can say I am alright at it. I am definitely not extremely good, but the last two places I worked, they were genuinely happy with my work. I got into this field in a weird way. I always liked to tinker with digital art, photography, etc. and I got a job as a designer straight out of college. Since then, I have worked in this field because I thought it was my passion and it was the only thing I could do to pay my bills. The more I worked in this field, the more I began to dislike graphic design. Over time, it became more of a chore for me. That's when I realized I am not passionate about it and just am in the field just because I have been in it for a while and I have some sense of design. For example, when I was working with a few brands, I just wanted to get the project over with so I can have some peace of mind. There was a lot of room for improvement but I didn't suggest it because more work for me. In the same train of thought, I am more than happy to be told what to do, and I will do it. Many passionate designers I met are completely against that idea. They want to give their own input and genuinely want to help their clients improve, but for me, it's just another deadline that needs to be done with. I also realized, if I have to compete with top designers to get better jobs, I have to improve my skills. Now, I would happily do it if I was genuinely passionate about it, but I know I am not.

&#x200B;

I quit my last job in June and have been surviving on my savings since then and now it seems to be running out. Since, June, I was so happy that I don't have to wake up and do this shitty job. I still tinker around with digital art and have fun doing it and that's when I realized I began hating my hobbies because of this job. I am old now to understand this passion and drive I cannot cultivate in this field for sure. Now I have to look for a job. Realistically, I can work for any ad agency or even try my hand out with Amazon (I have already worked with them) or some other corporate where I could get paid a decent amount, etc. but I am feeling I will go back to hating my life and work again. I am okay with a boring 9 to 5 job even if it is some mind-numbing work, as long as the pay is alright and timings are decent. I don't expect the perfect life anyways, but I feel I need to change this.

&#x200B;

Can any of you give me some solid career advice on this aspect? Should I just suck it up and continue working in this field especially when I am not passionate about it? I feel the only way I can make significant leaps in this field is my striving to constantly improve myself, but to do that, I need to genuinely love the work, which I don't. If not, what other options do I have? Some of my friends were telling me to get into hospitality since I am pretty good at talking to people and managing things and it also has a scope of me to go abroad (which is a long term plan for me). I feel going abroad bit will be severely hindered by graphic design because it's not a that sought after field with which I can move abroad.

&#x200B;

If you would suggest I stay in graphic design, are there any schools or courses that can help me? I am a fully self-taught designer so I have never had a proper foundation of design sense and style. I had a helpful mentor in my last job, and he kept telling me don't go for studies in this field, just keep working and you will improve. I learned a lot from him in terms of my work improving and all.  


Other than this, are there any other jobs or fields you would suggest?

Photography,B.Tech. student with absolutely no idea what to do next...Need advice..,14,ceoc6n,jkpz_98,9,"I am a 4th year [B.Tech](https://B.Tech). computer science student from Kerala. I study in a well reputed college and have been scoring good marks ( 84% as of now, 8.4 CGPA) throughout my course although my scores seems to be dropping semester after semester.

I went for engineering coaching and got really interested to take it mainly because I wasn't exposed to any other streams other than engineering and medicine. So I took Computer Science as my degree because I had a faint interest in it and it had a lot of job opportunities. 

But since my second year I started hating computer science, every aspect of it. I know many like it but it's just a no-go for me. I tried many fields like Block chain, Web Designing (had a little interest, the coding part ruined it), Machine learning, IoT, etc. but nothing sparks any interest in me. Now, just hearing the fact that I have to do the project and seminar for next year just brings me pain.

Now I have no idea what to do. There are campus placements in my college the coming year and I don't think I can pass them in the case of interviews or logical questioning as I am really bad at coding and most theory parts. And even if I pass, I don't think I will be interested in the work too.

I have a lot of interest in studying architecture and anything that ignites the creative spark in me(which Computer science doesn't). I am interested a lot in Photography (I take good photos too) and Graphic Design as well. But the career scope in these are very small compared to computer science. Also I have no idea how to develop these skills to a career/professional level one without committing to them, which in turn waste my time on studies and computer science.

What should I do?  Do I continue with computer science till I get an interest in it (which I don't think I will) or should I change my whole career to something else that I am interested in??

EDIT: I know changing careers would be a huge task and risk for me so I am trying my best to find a suitable field for me in computer science itself. Changing careers is like my last resort and I wouldn't do it unless I really want to.

However, you can take your hipsterishness to new levels and start shooting real film and develop it yourself. The equipment is cheap, film is not. There's plenty of places you can get the film developed/scanned, and if you plan to develop it yourself, you can still get chemicals (although the choice is getting more and more limited). 

Black and White photography is more fun. The results are different from your average digi shots (even with your digicam's Black and White setting) and it's easy to develop at home. And the photos look great.. More dramatic. 

Color film (Negatives) will still get you better shots than your point and shoot, but since you're not instant feedback you never know if you got the shot or not (This holds a certain appeal to people - The waiting part). 

Then you have Color Slide Film which is tougher to shoot than film (harder to get exposure right), but the colors and sharpness is insane and you get to see the photos right there on the strip (Negatives are, well, negatives).

Photography,Reddit India Recap of 2018,211,ab62uu,Devam13,27,"Welcome to the first ever installment of a year in review of this subreddit where we look at some of the best and most influential events and posts of this year. 

2018 has been quite a rollercoaster of a year for this subreddit as well as the country! With one of the highest growth rates ever of this subreddit. We grew from just above 100K subscribers to now more than the 1.6L magic number of subscribers. 

The year saw landmarks Supreme Court judgements in India, most importantly the striking of Section 377 of the IPC criminalizing gay sex. We have had many amazing posts this year which go from the entire subreddit grouping together to help people in Kerala with the largest donation drive ever on this subreddit with verified donations over ₹7,00,000 to paying college fees of a user who couldn't afford to. 

Here are some highlights in **no particular order** which made up this year of r/india: 

* [The massive Kerala donation drive started](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/981o7s/will_donate_thrice_the_number_of_upvotes_amount/) by /u/TheBeginnerr to match the donations to the upvotes of the thread inspired hundreds of Redditors to donate to the Kerala Disaster Relief Fund.  

* [Hindustan pencils responding to a request by a mother](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7k0muz/a_mother_wrote_to_hindustan_pencils_about_her/) sends special sharpeners created to be used by left-handed people with ease.

And the [beautiful image of a son no longer being considered a criminal](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9dt64s/if_you_are_not_moved_by_this_picture_i_wish_i_had/) became one of the highest voted posts of this year.

Photography,Can I become a Commercial Pilot?,14,crx8tg,Ishu054257,1,"Hello everyone, I hope everyone here is doing great today! :)  


This year I made a resolution that I will learn something new any chance I get. I got a camera and started learning photography and still learning and one thing that interested me from a very long time is Flying/driving/riding. I always love to drive/ride. Now I am thinking to learn how to fly but I thought it was impossible because you need physics and math ( I am a commerce Student) as an entry requirement. Recently I was looking for flying club for hobby flying and I cam across Bombay Flying Club. They have multiple courses. 

  
 STUDENTS PILOT’S LICENCE (SPL)

 PRIVATE PILOT LICENCE (PPL)

 COMMERCIAL PILOT LICENCE (CPL)  
 [https://www.thebombayflyingclub.com/Pilot\_training.html](https://www.thebombayflyingclub.com/Pilot_training.html) 

  
For the 1st two there is no Physics or Math requirement for learning how to fly but for Commercial Lience you need   Physics and Math’s.   


So what I was wondering If I complete  PRIVATE PILOT LICENCE (PPL) or they also havbe Single Engine Flying Training will I be able for Commercial Pilot Licence like will I be able to join airline industry as pilot.   


Any suggestions/advice will be much appreciated.

Photography,does it ever happen to you? I get obsessed about new hobbies for a while and then I stop them,4,bykzgg,zandublam,5,"I am noticing a pattern with myself. I feel like I want to try new things, initially I spend lot of time researching, how to start, what all things to buy etc.. once I buy those things, it slowly fades away. I don't even feel like I am interested in those. 

I have wasted a lot of time. But moreover I feel bad about my behaviour. Here are some things I tried in the last year and how I wasted money

1. Bought an expensive guitar. Thought I will learn guitar, so bought Yamaha F310. I spent a month researching which guitar to buy, which sites to follow to learn guitar etc. I didn;t even practise for a week. Now it is gathering dust.

2. Photography. Everyone suggested don't buy an expensive camera. But I thought, photography is the one. Bought an expensive Nikon 7 series DSLR. Played around it for a month. But thats it. Now, I dont even feel like taking photos. 

3. Books. I don't read books at all. So I thought I will start reading and develop this hobby. This interest also peaked when there was a thread on randia in book suggestions. I bought most of the books which were suggested in that thread (close to 20 I think). Till today I haven't moved past first chapter of a book.

4. Drones. They were all craze last year. Bought DJI Spark and never really used it. Sold it off OLX after 6 months, bearing heavy losses. 

5. Online Mooc courses. Signed up, but never completed. Good thing coursera charges monthly basis and you can cancel anytime you want to.

6. Drawing / Doodling. Thought I will try this as a hobby. Bought so many learning material, books, sheets, pencils etc etc. In this list, this prolly is the least expensive one.

7. I guess you get the gist now. So I will just mention things: carpentry, cooking, play station 4 (though sold it off quickly with minimal loss), bicycle, skateboard, gym membership, home gym equipments, arduino electronic kits, trekking materials 

all of these have a same pattern:

1. first I find about or learn about something new on reddit or from some people trying it out. It could be entirely a new thing which I never heard of OR some thing which I never tried earlier.

2. Next I spend insane amount of time researching it. Sometimes this goes over months. (e.g. for camera, drone etc). I try to read online about each and every thing. Product related or user experiences. Sometimes I have even made notes on these things

3. I spend money, get the things which are required. 

4. I try out for couple of days to couple of weeks. Then I completely stop. 

5. Post this period, I don't even feel like thinking about or learning.

5. I feel so guilty of this, I avoid encountering those things. For example, most of the stuff is hidden or kept away in cupboard so that I don't look at them everyday. I avoid whatsapp / telegram related groups, like photography groups etc completely. 

6. Then I find something new to obsess about and the whole thing repeats. 

Does this happen with any of you here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bykzgg/does_it_ever_happen_to_you_i_get_obsessed_about/
Photography,I'm stuck with my career and could use some guidance. I am genuinely lost.,7,cm8zqf,throwaway_xx92,1,"This is a long post and I cannot tl;dr it because I need to explain my situation. Sorry about that!

So I am a 27-year-old who is a graphic designer by profession. I have been in this domain for 4 years and I can say I am alright at it. I am definitely not extremely good, but the last two places I worked, they were genuinely happy with my work. I got into this field in a weird way. I always liked to tinker with digital art, photography, etc. and I got a job as a designer straight out of college. Since then, I have worked in this field because I thought it was my passion and it was the only thing I could do to pay my bills. The more I worked in this field, the more I began to dislike graphic design. Over time, it became more of a chore for me. That's when I realized I am not passionate about it and just am in the field just because I have been in it for a while and I have some sense of design. For example, when I was working with a few brands, I just wanted to get the project over with so I can have some peace of mind. There was a lot of room for improvement but I didn't suggest it because more work for me. In the same train of thought, I am more than happy to be told what to do, and I will do it. Many passionate designers I met are completely against that idea. They want to give their own input and genuinely want to help their clients improve, but for me, it's just another deadline that needs to be done with. I also realized, if I have to compete with top designers to get better jobs, I have to improve my skills. Now, I would happily do it if I was genuinely passionate about it, but I know I am not.

I quit my last job in June and have been surviving on my savings since then and now it seems to be running out. Since, June, I was so happy that I don't have to wake up and do this shitty job. I still tinker around with digital art and have fun doing it and that's when I realized I began hating my hobbies because of this job. I am old now to understand this passion and drive I cannot cultivate in this field for sure. Now I have to look for a job. Realistically, I can work for any ad agency or even try my hand out with Amazon (I have already worked with them) or some other corporate where I could get paid a decent amount for some donkey job where I don't have to think much, etc. but I am feeling I will go back to hating my life and work again. I am okay with a boring 9 to 5 job even if it is some mind-numbing work, as long as the pay is alright and timings are decent. I don't expect the perfect life anyways, but I feel I need to change this.

Can any of you give me some solid career advice on this aspect? Should I just suck it up and continue working in this field especially when I am not passionate about it? I feel the only way I can make significant leaps in this field is my striving to constantly improve myself, but to do that, I need to genuinely love the work, which I don't. If not, what other options do I have? Some of my friends were telling me to get into hospitality since I am pretty good at talking to people and managing things and it also has a scope of me to go abroad (which is a long term plan for me). I feel going abroad bit will be severely hindered by graphic design because it's not a that sought after field with which I can move abroad.

If you would suggest I stay in graphic design, are there any schools or courses that can help me? I am a fully self-taught designer so I have never had a proper foundation of design sense and style. I had a helpful mentor in my last job, and he kept telling me don't go for studies in this field, just keep working and you will improve. I learned a lot from him in terms of my work improving and all.

Photography,Need of advice from married people on choosing a life partner,11,ad5bax,sunrays6,22,"_TL;DR_ Would you settle and make best out of what you have got or would you take risk and try harder? Not that I will blindly follow one's advice but it will help me to take good decision.

I'm from middle class who is an introvert, well groomed, fit and active. Having varied interests and hobbies keeps me occupied esp., travelling, trekking and photography. Working in a small IT startup I earn enough to live a comfortable life.

My parents have been trying to get me married for the past 3 years. Coming from a small city, my family is moderately conservative. They definitely want a bride in same caste and matching horroscope. Most preferably in same city so that they can know well about bride's family background. We are signed up in matrimonial sites also. The selection process is usually this: my parents check for kundli match and girl's family, out of which I choose one that's looking good, then if both families agree do we have a meeting in a temple. That's when I look for matching personality.

Parents are dissatisfied and already tired of me as I'm picky. They expect me to choose the one just with good family and kundli match. They don't care about personality and the appearance. Met couple of potential bride vis a vis with family in a temple who were good looking but are boring ""family girls"" who doesn't have passion for anything nor did they show interest in what I do. So we didn't proceed.

Recently I met similar one. We talked for 15 mins. It was me talking most of the time. She asked about my job, do I own car, can I cook. I try to understand her from her daily activities. She was like home-to-work, work-to-home in weekdays and may visit malls in the weekends if not visiting hometown. There wasn't much of similarities other than both of us are in software industry. Her realtive was rushing to end this talk and she didn't have anything to talk. Their family and girl instantly showed their interest to proceed. I held my parents, who were also interested, and said we'll go home and reply.

It was difficult for me to decide life partner within few minutes. I want to know many other things including whether she can keep herself healthy and fit in the future, whether she is interested to accompany me for weekend trips, etc. Made my parents to call them and ask for a casual meeting in a public place. They refused and will allow further talks only if I say yes. Pretty conservative and probably they fear I might reject after the talk and it'll be a shame for them.

I'm gonna hit 30 soon. It's considered past marriageable age by many. So, fewer opportunities. Also skewed sex ratio! I'm confused shall I settle for this (like [Bojack says](https://youtu.be/cTAi_3HWKHQ) ) or take risk and look out further. I appreciate your advice.

_EDIT:_ To provide better context, I don't have much of social circle. There are few male friends with whom I hangout occasionally and travel. They also don't have girlfriends. Actually they don't care about it. My introversion wasn't helpful to find a life partner.
I have had couple of relationships in the past whom I met through dating apps. They lasted few months to a year. If it were strong, I would be determined to marry irrespective of parents' approval. But no. Time is ticking more loudly now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ad5bax/need_of_advice_from_married_people_on_choosing_a/

Photography,Broke up 30! What next???,14,al2pdh,ablahnaari,12,"Hi Everyone,

I browse through reddit quite a bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships/life.So here goes my story.

A little about myself. I'm 30 yr old Indian woman working in IT and earning well. I am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left us.She has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other Indian families.

I had my share of relations when I was young and I was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20's and I made good use of it. I started traveling and over years have come to love it. Travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say I am decent at both. Being single also taught me value of friendships and I'm fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years.

I met my bf (32 yrs) two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together. As we started talking about future I realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business/ agriculture (he mentioned it casually once a yr ago. I had no idea he was serious about it).  I refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career. I hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances. For the reasons above and also that I would be giving up all my friends,leaving my mom,work, travel everything for one person seemed like a bad deal.

We tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup. This breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything. I want to stop feeling negative about my ex (somewhere I feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs) and stop feeling sad for myself. I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head.Any suggestions are welcome!

Thanks,

Ablahnaari!

So my thoughts on how candidates should go about getting hired

**My college sucks. I’ll be graduating in a year or two. What to do? What should I learn? What project should I do?**

Firstly, I'll just give a brief rundown of where I see the IT industry heading over the next 5-10 years. I think the 3 safest areas to build your career around are Android, iOS and Javascript. 

I do not see any other mobile OS breaking the dominance of Android or iOS in the next 10 years - the mobile OS wars are over and we are heading into the territory where Windows and OS X are now for the desktop. So learning Java/Android and Swift/iOS are safe bets. I do not see cross platform toolkits (Ionic, Xamarin etc) expanding beyond a niche so you don't need to worry about them. 

For web based apps, Javascript will always be evergreen since it is impossible for browsers to change the HTML/CSS/JS paradigm. And even for serverside, it looks like Node.js (a web framework written in Javascript) will beat out Ruby on Rails (web framework written in Ruby) and Django (a web framework written in Python) eventually. However it isn't clear who'll win the client side framework wars (React? Vue? Angular? Some new framework?) so this is a tricky part. However, client side frameworks are fairly simple and learning one should provide a roadmap to learning all others.

My recommendation - pick either Javascript (Node.js + one of React/Vue/Angular) or Android/Java or iOS/Swift. Keep in mind though that Android/Java and iOS/Swift are more likely to be popular in consumer apps while Javascript (web apps) are more likely to be popular in business apps. Business apps generally quietly make lots and lots and lots of money but consumer apps are more fun to work on. Choose wisely. 

Now you've picked one - what project to do? Pick a hobby you have - music? photography? fitness?. *Make something that you will use everyday in this hobby*. For example, if fitness is your hobby then you can make a fitness goal tracking app. Divide the project into different levels of progression. Level one can be a simple way to log your workouts. Level two can be adding user profiles so you can see your friends workouts. Level three can be adding GPS tracking. Level four can be adding tracking diet. And so on. By the time you go for an interview, this project with all its different modules will be like your baby and you'll be able to spend hours talking about it.

Its important to pick a project where the app you'll build is something you will use. You'll never use a library management system or restaurant order management system so there is no point building these types of apps even though they most commonly show up when you search for ""app ideas"".

**<Insert Story of Company Recruitment Being Terrible/Time in Company Being Terrible>. Can you recommend me good companies?**

This is tricky. Sometimes, especially in big companies, they can be both great and terrible at the same time - because its your manager who usually sets the experience in the company. I can't really recommend but I can give some steps for finding ones. Firstly do not subscribe to cliches like that MNCs = evil, crappy work and startups = force of good, exciting work or Indian companies = all suck, crappy and US companies = amazing, high quality work. They are plenty of well run, great MNCs and plenty of terrible startups and well run Indian companies and crappy US companies . 

Here you'll have to put aside your programming skills and work on your social engineering skills. First, try and identify who'll be your manager. Ask your interviewers who'll be your manager after you are selected. Try and read up on him, web, his blogs, Linkedin etc. Try and see if can use your web stalking skills to find some ex-employees of him. Take them out for coffee or beer and try and get a sense of how they feel like their manager it. It might sound like too much work but its better than spending a year in hell counting down the days to when you can get your job and and move on from your nightmare of a manager.

**Certifications? Yay or nay?**

**NAY NAY NAY A HUNDRED TIMES NAY**. I can't believe we are still asking this question. I have yet to see a certification that actually was helpful. The only companies that seem to care about certifications are the ones that issue them themselves e.g. Cisco. 

**Time gap, failed papers, no degree, marks too low or something else negative. What to do?**

There is little you can do about it. A company will ever have a policy on it (e.g. not hire people without graduate degrees or with supplies) and there is nothing you can do about it OR they will not have a policy on it in which they will almost always hire you if you are good enough since there is a shortage of good CS engineers and all companies are desperate. Just make up some story to explain all these - family could not afford, medical reasons, family emergency etc a bit of white lies is better in this case than brutal honesty (I decided to just play video games all semester).

**Can I work with you?**

I should have written the rant 3 years ago when I was still recruiting :). Unfortunately, about 2 years ago I decided to just keep my business on autopilot mode. This meant transiting out of full time employees to short term contractors. I little over 30 now - have sufficient savings from both working in USA and from my business and will eventually sell my business in 1-2 years so I have no financial urgency to work for the next couple of years. So, I am just taking it easy mostly these days, trying to think of what new adventures await and shitposting on Randia =).

I've not studied much my entire life, as I was able to manage upto 10th without having to study. 11th was a huge kick in the ass for me - but I've learnt nothing and have still not started studying. 


I've been thoroughly incapacitated by depression- which I've had for about five years now- and cannot hold a routine for shit. I'm taking therapy and medication, but depression isn't the only issue apparently, anxiety is a huge problem too. While the suicidal thoughts did recede for a while, they're coming back now, because of how big and final the board exams feel. I know I am going to fuck it up. I probably won't fail it, but anything below 90% is insignificant for OC anyway (I think).

So many people are helping me, yet I've done nothing but disappoint. Doesn't help that my family is filled with over-achievers. I am emotionally drained and exhausted. If I have to redo this year, I'd rather drop out or kill myself. What do I do now? What does a guy who fucks up his education do? I do shitty photography, and play shitty guitar. I am not good enough at either of them for it to be of any significance. I don't know if I will ever be able to push myself to actually study, because that's something I've been fooling myself with for the last year.


I have a practice practical exam tomorrow, and have not started shit for it. Fucked up every other revision exam. Every exam this year has been a disaster.

What can I do?

Photography,Its becoming hard/Impossible to find good CS jobs in India.,100,6v9vtx,eskimoFry,42,"But unlike some people, I am willing to dedicate more of my resources and skills to find the right fit.

Why can't employers do the same?

Edit: Some questions I read.

Z921 in their rant on another thread here:
> You need to have a hobby other than photography

Who are you to decide what hobby is worth my time? Sounds like you are the kind of person to micro-manage your employees and be on people's shoulders like vedhal is to vikramadithya. Also sounds like you are/will be the kind of parent who does not like what their child is doing and would like him/her to study engineering.

> DumbwitPatra:
> What is your expectation from an employer? How can I, as an employer, assess you and be sure you're unlike the others? Jobs ARE available. But the people aren't knowledgeable enough. Even engineering passouts with 80-85% can't crack simple dynamic programming questions. I hire based on a coding test I give on hackerrank. And out of 400+ CS engineers from tier 1 collegee, only 15 or 20 students (per college) could get three questions right in 3.5 hours. Because we want coders who have strong basics, we hire only there's people. If you're one among them, you'll get a job. If you aren't, you need to have visible proof that you have put in efforts to specialize in a particular field. The guy who is leading the AI team in my company is from BBA background. He learnt AI and math from the internet, built some applications and had content that would show his efforts. If you do have something like that, take your idea to a hackathon. You'll have your idea recognized even if you don't win and will get a job. However, I'm not sure if i understood your question right. What are you expecting from your employer and what change do you want to see in the way hiring is done?

Quantitative Aptitude exams. The messages you are sending to your prospective employees are:

* You only care about speed and memorizing power and nothing else about the developer because all your talk of github profiles and other hobbies does not come into play until you see my resume yourself which is usually after all the written rounds.
* For all the talk of being the risk takers in the industry, you don't want to trust your prospective employee so you pass up on a potentially good employee who may not have the best aptitude test taking skills.

What you expect to happen:

* You assume good aptitude problem skills imply good problem solving skills.
* You assume people won't game the aptitude round and learn just enough to pass that round.
* You assume that all the brilliant programmers solve the problems in no time and you are left with a roster of excellent developers.

What usually happens:

* People game the system and just study how to solve the test problems.
* Actually good developers may not have the time to study aptitude problems because, surprise! they are busy learning actual programming. Many good developers get filtered out in the first round due to the lack of knowledge in aptitude.

> I hire based on a coding test I give on hackerrank. And out of 400+ CS engineers from tier 1 collegee, only 15 or 20 students (per college) could get three questions right in 3.5 hours. Because we want coders who have strong basics, we hire only there's people.

15 or 20 students per college seems like the right amount of students who are actually passionate about their field. When the stakes are high, Skills go down a few notches. It's the observer effect. As soon as people find out they are being assessed or being watched they don't perform as well.

> What are you expecting from your employer?

* If you want Tom Cruise as your boyfriend, you need to be Cameron Diaz. If you want brilliant developers, you must be a innovating company who offers their weight in salary and/or Resume Value. If I am a good developer, then it is possible I know my worth. I am not going to put up with you for $400 a month or less.

* Stop taking credit for my work. I once heard that my friend got a pat in the back for making the company $12000. He never got a bonus or saw $1 of that money.

* I want you to stop whining and start treating employees like human beings. Pay them a proper wage and give them interesting problems to solve. Automate the boring stuff. Don't ask me to do the documentation manually. Haven't you heard of tools that do the documentation from comments in code?

* Once I am hired. I want a manager who actually understands what I am saying and not some prison warden who intimidates devs to get things done before a very early deadline that they came up with without consulting the devs. This is a sure way to make devs secretly hate you while burning out.

* I want reasonable work-life balance. I am passionate about programming, but I am a human being too.

* More investment into employee training or undergraduate education in the government. I know IT companies lobby a lot, so I expect them to actually put effort to improve the syllabus of colleges to suit what they want in terms of technical knowledge by diverting some money towards education.

Yes but I am not the one whining about not finding good developers. It is the employers looking for good developers but are not willing to pay them a living wage.

> People working as game testers for ₹10000 per month

There is your problem. Why are you not willing to pay more?

I am not personally looking for a job. I have one. It is good but I notice the bad side of IT occasionally. Namely the ""this will do"" attitude from people who expect a lot for less. It's about managing your expectations as an employer when you are asking your employees to manager their expectations of their salary.

Photography,I need some help in deciding what to do with my life. Any help would be appreciated.,37,7fxfgw,roadmap_throwaway,22,"Sorry for this huge wall of text, but I have to be detailed in this because I need some help.

I'm in a very weird situation in life right now and could use some advice. Please be honest. I'll give you a little background about myself without trying to dox me. I am a 25-year-old graphic designer by profession. I graduated from an average college in 2013 with a degree in Journalism (one of the biggest mistakes of my life, especially in terms of the three years I lost). After graduating from college, I was in a tough financial situation, so I had to immediately get a job to support myself. Since I knew the basics of photoshop, I just applied for a job as a graphic designer with an agency and got it. I worked there for 8 months, and quit due to deteriorating mental health. After that, I spent about a year and a half battling that mental condition, which still affects me, and again, got a job as a graphic designer at a startup, due to financial strain. I worked at that job for 6 months (till the company closed down) and then got my current job, which I have been working at for around 1.5 years, again, because I have no other skills. Now, in this 1.5 years + 6 months, is where I properly learned the tools of design and got some idea of how the industry works on the design front. Again, I never had any ambition in this field, I just got into because I had no other skills.

Another thing about my ""career""; Since I said, I took this job out of desperation, I'll be honest with you about my skills. Design doesn't come naturally to me. I have zero thought process on how to design. I have to look at tons of other things (like brochures, ads etc.) to even begin conceptualizing a layout or color scheme. I have come across some seriously talented and dedicated designers and sometimes feels ashamed of myself on how I work. Also, I am not terrible at what I do. I am pretty decent. Especially when I put my heart to it. But over the last few months, my mental issues, lack of confidence and general bleak outlook on life has made my job harder.

Now, I feel, that this job has reached a plateau phase and I have to do something better with my life. I was wondering if I should enroll in National Institute of Design's Graphic Design Post Graduate program. I don't know if it will actually help me learn or improve my life and job prospects in any way, but so far, whatever I do, I learned on the job.

Now some other details. Right now, I get paid 30K a month out of which, if I live an absolutely frugal lifestyle (no eating out in fancy places, no beer, no trips, no shopping), I save around 5K minimum around 10K maximum. I am talking about in terms of savings. If I do plan to enroll, I will only be able to in the 2019-2021 Batch. I feel I will need a year to start properly saving up, get loans, writing all the entrance exams and preparing myself.

Now here are my other concerns. When I look at this roadmap, I will be ""job ready"" only by the age of 29. Which is a very scary thought for me, because I will be sorta back to square one. Another major issue for me is, even though my life is quite bleak, one of the few things in life that keep me going is the woman I love. She is not the kind who will ever pressurize me into marriage (even though her parents will) and she told me, if I am serious about this, she will convince them to wait for me to finish graduating.

I want to know, is this sudden jump worth the risk? Honestly speaking, I feel very depressed and quite often suicidal because of the mediocre life I have led so far, and nothing seems like a happy ending to me. Even thinking of this move, has taken a huge toll on my already deteriorating mental health. I am talking about if this will help me long term in terms of career opportunities. I don't aim to slack off and ""party"" through college if I get in. I am willing to slog to the point of death if this will actually help me.

What would really help me, other than general advice is, if anyone has studied in NID, they could tell me if the course is worth my time and money. Will I actually learn something there? Like I said, I am ready to work my ass off because I know I only have one shot at this and I don't want to botch that. Also, if you do know anyone who studied there, could you please link them to this post, or just ask them?

**Edit:** Hey guys. Sorry, I just saw the post now. Wasn't feeling to well and just wen't to bed after posting. First of all, thanks for taking your time and talking to me. I am sorry that I didn't state much of my technical knowledge and the source of motivation for me to even look up NID.

**Source of motivation:** So, like I mentioned above, I got into design because I HAD to get a job, and the only bankable skill I had was how to use photoshop. Everything else, I learnt on the job, mostly through trial and error. I started feeling a course in design would help me because it will give me a more structured approach into working.  A better understanding of layouts, colors, what works, what doesn't. Honestly, one of the biggest drawbacks I have is, convincing the client of the final design. Like, even when I present it to them, I do it with this weird look showing a huge lack in confidence, and that usually lets them ask me for multiple changes or with them saying they are not happy with the design. The current job I am working at, my boss is my friend from college, and he encourages me a lot to work without thinking of these things, but in the end, when I interact with the clients, this still happens. They say, yeah, the design is okay. Could we have another iteration? My friend is the one who convinces them into accepting the design saying a lot of business jargon. Bottom line is, I always see my work as mediocre and cannot accept it as what it is. I know, a Degree from NID won't immediately have an impact in my thought process, but I fell, I can at least support my self by saying, I do have an idea of what I want to do.

Another question I came across a few times with the answers you people wrote were whether I am looking to study for a bump up in the salary? My answer is primarily no. Yes, overtime I would love a nice paying job, but right now, it's more of me to learn something, because everything I do right now is from looking at other peoples works. I don't know how correct I am when I say this, but I feel that a degree from NID will add that prestigious college stamp, and help me get better opportunities and a better network too. And and some weight to me, mentally, in terms of confidence.

Technical Knowledge and hobbies - Adobe Illustrator (most proficient in this), Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom. Hobbies - Photography (very amateur). I can write a bit of content too. But it's not something I would market.

Another weird point (I don't know if it's relevant) is, I am quite well versed in pop culture and ""western culture"" of sorts. The reason I am bringing this up is, I use this as a major influence when I work in terms of design. Many menus and interior decor designs I did for my clients (which they loved), were inspired from this and they said it looks and feels much different from boring things they usually see elsewhere. I mean, it's not a huge skill. Lot of people nowadays are more ""globalized"" and dazzle people with one liners from TV shows and all in their designs, but I just mentioned this, because the agency I work for got a lot of praise from these ""out-of-box-for-india"" style work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7fxfgw/i_need_some_help_in_deciding_what_to_do_with_my/
Photography,[R] Why are Indians blindly running after MONEY???,28,5zqaur,modgill,99,"What i dont understand is that why do Indians run for Money!!!. Wherever i look, everyday, i see Indians trying to get squeeze every inch of a penny from customers, trying to sell everything possible. etc. 

The people working for salaries like 50k or even 90k or 1.5L a month, don't actually have a life. to be honest ( MY opinion)

Okay, a person earning 1.5 L a month (like a cousin in delhi does) is extremely busy all the time. I have seen high earning salaried class, going to offices from 7 AM (2 hour drive) , returning at 10pm. Sometimes, they are thrown away to projects in other cities for months at a time. 

And in some places, Saturdays are also working. and on top of that, fierce competition, stress, anxiety. 

I know a person earning 3L a month. He has to go to office at 8am, and he returns at 11pm. He works in exports (Merchandiser). The stress he is in everyday in unbelievable. He suffers from insomnia and panic attacks. Is this MONEY worth your health???

People are dying In exchange for What? MONEY? shit doesnt get more stupid then this. 

Before people start burning me and asking me how i live my life. I basically started from scratch with clear goals in Mind when i made my own company at age of 21
1) Work only 4 hours a day
2) Holidays - 2 atleast in a year
3) No Stress related work
4) Debtfree forever
5) Self-Sustaining income
6) Passive income from investments

Today, even if i dont work, i can live through my life from passive income. Hell, i can live even without passive income. 

And a lot of Indians can live like the way i live. But they choose not to , for one simple reason. MORE MONEY. 

A lot of people i know personally. like 95% of them, live under loans. Car loans, house loans, credit card lines, PC limits, etc. They are basically stuck in a vicious circle of being a spend thrift and then working their asses off to pay the monthly obligations and creating more obligations for themselves for a FAKE future. 

Although when you transfer yourself into a more frugal and acceptable way of living, you will realise that the true happiness if being with your family, spending time with kids, chilling out in the sun and not thinking you will be late for office. And most importantly, being DEBT-FREE. Only after that you can think of creating Self-Sustaining earning for yourselves. 

Just ask yourself few questions and maybe they don't all apply to you, and maybe a few of them do. But if they do, just think why are you doing this? and creating Stress for yourself.
1. Why do you need a phone that costs 40k+?
2. Why do you need to buy a house on loan?
3. Why buy a car on loan? 
4. Why spend what you dont have yet (C.C.)
5. Why work more than 45 Hours a week? 
6. Why you go on a holiday and post pictures on facebook EVERYTIME? (Occasionally its okay)
7. Why do you put pictures of the food you eat on Insta, FB, Twitter??? 
8. Does it feel like, you are travelling to various places just to put pictures on your facebook and insta??? and if it does, why do you do it?
9. Dont you feel that your Job is hindering in doing what you actually LIKE? (Travelling, Hiking, Trekking, Exploring) etc.
10. Even if you can afford the most expensive phones? why do you ACTUALLY need it? have you asked yourself that? 
11. Have you lost touch with various people you loved? and WHY have you? Lack of TIME?
12. Do you want to learn something technical and CANT DO SO EVER? (Guitar, photography, boating, climbing, learning a piano, learning another language)

These are just A FEW of the things, which everyone of you must ask yourself. Because ultimately at the end, We are all going to die, one way or another. And to be brutally honest, a lot of people are going to regret how they lived their life. Not everything is about ""MORE MONEY"". And when you die, most probably you will be forgotten in 50 years. and that too if you become a celebrity. Otherwise, chances are you will be forgotten instantly. 

I have even seen people mentioning a ""BALANCE"". What balance? that you work for 6 days a week for 8 hours a day and then Sunday is a BALANCE? because that shit doesn't sound like a 50/50 balance to me. We sleep around 8 hours a day. And the rest of activities we SHOULD be doing in a day would constitute for around 7-8 hours (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Exercise, Errands). What you are left with is about 8 hours FREE. in which most of you only WORK. Exercise is totally forgotten. and even that 2 hours for exercise is given to work. 

Where is the time for yourself? to contemplate? to think? to feel about yourself? to do things you ACTUALLY want to do? 

I think even working for 4 hours a day is TOO MUCH. and should infact be only 2-3 hours. 

Money is just something the BANKS have created out of thin air, on which they ask you to pay an interest!!!. 

Have you thought about where the INTEREST money comes from which you pay??? . You guessed it, BANKS print them too. There is no Way out of the DEBT system. 

Only changes in your lifestyle and the way you feel about the world can result in self sustainable income and environment , where you can do things you want. 

Think about these things deeply.

Photography,Indian multimedia is horrendous.,99,560z3n,Art3sian,40,"So I'm part of an multimedia help group. We volunteer, helping people from all over the world with various software, but mostly Photoshop. People will post their images or animations and ask for help or feedback which we assist with. 

Now I've been doing this for more than 8 years and I'm educated in art and multimedia design, and classically trained in print advertising. I'm also a graphic designer. So I know what I'm doing and I know what I'm talking about, as do the other volunteers. 

Now, India. Whenever we get an upload from India it's almost always a case of the following:

1. The work is terrible. Over use of vignette, blur, exposure, saturation. 
2. It's a ridiculous portrait. For example, some guy sitting on the roof of a Ferrari. 
3. It's almost always men of various ages working on images of themselves. Really over-acted poses and stares. Just, shit really, no matter how it's analysed. 
4. Despite the fact that it's a helping forum with clear instructions to post AND ask your questions, Indian work is NEVER posted up with any questions. It's just posted and left like, *""Look at my awesome work!""*

Now I'm not biased or racist or generalising and if you think I am, I couldn't give a shit. This is based on 8 years of experience and the simple, statistical reality of almost all posts that come in to our site from India. No other country's people act this way on our site. Every one else mostly posts reasonably good work of general artistic topics and asks for help on some level. Not Indians. It's always vain, childish trash that none of us volunteers can even begin to understand, and when we offer feedback (which is usually not positive but always polite) we meet incredible resistance. Like how dare we critique work and offer suggestions to work that is posted to our free art critiquing website? It's not a gallery. It's a help and critique site made very clear by all the comments and critique publicly displayed, **as well as** the rules stated upon posting. 

Even if you look at our collective ban list right now. 248 people banned in 8 years. 233 of them registered as being from India. 

So what's up with this, India? How do I better understand what's going on here? How do I help you to help yourselves? Why is your art and photography so self-centred, vain, and forgive me, just plain terrible, and why won't you listen to **free**, professional advice on a free, professional advice website that **you came to**?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/560z3n/indian_multimedia_is_horrendous/

Photography,[RANT] Reservation Quotas.,115,3afiny,takemybody,129,"Everyday I wake up and regret being born in this country. I gave 3 competitive exams this year for different colleges. I was not selected in any of them. It's okay. I accept it.

Here's the part that grinds my gears. Reservation category. People getting selected on the basis of what their caste is  plain ridiculousness. Let me tell you these competitive exams were design aptitude and Film desgin (Specific area). I know a guy who got selected in a  college, he didn't even know what WHITE BALANCE in camera was until I told him (this was after 2 days of result declaration in which he was selected). The douche has Canon 5Dmark3. ""Photu me background blur ho raha hai, bc FB pe photography page kholo"" type dude. His father is super rich. Owns a jewelery shop.

Reservation quota does injustice with someone who knows better than the aforementioned prick. I am not saying I deserved that seat but.....fuck it man, this all just makes me super sad in general about India. 

Government sectors are not top notch as they should be because pile of reserved pricks got through who were only better taking bribes but nothing else. 

I am going to give entrance for FTII this year. In total 10 seats. In which 5 seats are reserved. Let's see how it goes for me. Considering the current situation at FTII with all the protests and all, this year too there will be no intake, a zero year. If this happens another slap to India's body of work. 2nd consecutive Zero year it will be in FTII.

EDIT:- NEW TO THIS SUB REDDIT. Didn't know this has been posted before also. Sorry for that. Anyway, sorry for the inconvenience. Kindly ignore or downvote the thread just for your satisfaction.

EDIT:- Hey, I also get the part where I didn't get the seat in unreserved category. I get it. I also accept it. But the 'whining like a little bitch' as some of you are calling is because of the stupid system. That prick with canon 5dmark3 didn't deserved that seat. Bas bc. He said ""jo photu me blur hota hai"" which is  ""SHadow depth of field"" makes me sad.

EDIT:- Adding extra point which is totally off topic but have surely done everything to bring my moral down. FUCKING RELATIVES. Fuck them all. I hope they die a painful death.

Photography,21 (F) Backpacking India solo in October! Seeking advice/tips!,37,4uu5hv,SilkyWizard,68,"Hey Guys! Firstly, all my flights are booked. This isn't a ""is it safe"" thread :) I am well aware of the dangers and scams. I have done and am doing my research. I know what to wear etc. Thanks for your concern!



I'm flying into New Delhi on the 19th of October, staying for one night then probably heading off to Jaipur the next day. I would rather avoid going to Agra, and want to get out of Delhi ASAP so i'm going to skip the Taj/Save it for next time.




Im hoping to head to Pushkar after that, and then off to Udaipur and Jodhpur, after that I have no sort of sense of where to go next. I want to go in the general direction of the south (Goa, Kerala etc.) I'm hoping to spend 3-4 months travelling around. I should have $2000-2500 AUD to spend (100,488 - 125,606 Rupees) maybe even more. Any advice on time I should spend in certain cities etc. would be greatly appreciated. Im really into photography and video. Really keen on going to markets, trying lots of food, buying clothes, seeing some awesome architecture etc.



Would like some recommendations on: - Doing classes, yoga, massage, cooking etc. where to do them - Buying clothes, places to avoid or places to 'save space' for - Activities (like camel ride in Jaisalmer, which I probably wont be doing this time)



I want to know how to go about money; Should I get out a large amount before I go? Use my card? Are there many ATM's around? Whats a good system to have to avoid getting my money stolen.



Any other advice or anything would be cool. Also if you're going to be in Rajasthan around the same time let me know!

Photography,Kota District Collector's letter to the parents of IIT aspirants [NP],185,4i91ig,grasssrootz,40,"Dear Parents,

On behalf of Kota City, I take this opportunity to welcome your child to a city of wonders which processes the young minds of this country and fuels their passion to become the architects of Modern India.

My humble request at the beginning of this letter is to read this with some patience and time and it would be ideal if both the parents can read this together.

It is the dream of every parent to see his child touch the pinnacles of success and reach places which only few can afford. Every parent plants a seed in the mind of the child which over a period of time bears fruits but after careful nourishment and tendering since the seed is so tender that any mishandling may fail us from realizing our dream.

It is a very difficult situation for parents to leave their child in a place where they do not live and things become still difficult when the purpose for which the child is left behind is for dedicated and committed efforts in scaling excellence in education.

When parents look at the huge billboard signage/hoarding/ newspaper clips depicting pictures of young beautiful children who have achieved what they dream for their child, the resolution to inspire and motivate their children becomes still stronger.

Good career in the field of Engineering & Medicine, as the case may be, is more or less like certain insurance in terms of decent earning and living standards. I sincerely think that in most of the cases, this is the very reason that makes us dream such careers for our children.

There is nothing wrong in thinking on a certain kind of Assured Career Insurance for one’s child since limited resources and high degree of competition demands one to think ahead of times.

However, I think we all agree that the world too has changed drastically in the last 15-20 years so much so, that most of the facilities and services that were available for a limited few are now available to many due to the huge progress in technology which was witnessed in this period.

Art, Entertainment, Professional Sports, Literature, Health & Fitness, Entrepreneurship, Journalism, Photography, Event management, Music, Adventure, Destination tourism, etc, to name a few too witnessed immense growth in comparison to the bygone era.

Many of these even created a new niche which not just nurtured creative potential of the human mind and its capabilities but also were very successful career options.

Well, the point is not about asking you to see them as better options but certainly to see them also as options.

It is a matter of fact that today, young children are facing immense amount of pressure relating to their academic performance and due to the same many of them go through various levels of stress.

Even if we consider that a certain element of stress would exist in competition parental support, care and the right kind of family situations would help the child to cope with any difficult situation.

However, current reality is that due to the lack of right kind of conditions and support systems, many children are going through stress uncared and unattended for and in a few cases such situations disabled the children to such an extreme extent that they committed suicide…

Don’t get frightened suddenly as to what is being said about your child… Your child is perfectly safe and sound and you have no reasons to worry, but you have reasons to have concern of your child which I believe you will understand as we read my letter further.

I consider myself a very unfortunate person because I got a chance to read around 20-25 Suicide Notes of Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

Am I giving so many adjectives to such children because they committed Suicide?

I am sorry. Answer is No… They were in fact, as I said earlier, Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

A Girl with an amazing command of English language in her suicide note (grammatically perfect 5-page Suicide Note with beautiful running handwriting) thanks her mother for giving up her career for raising the children… Subtle hint that she was pricked on this matter again and again.

Another girl wants her grandmother to become her mother in her next birth. Another requests her parents to allow her younger sister to do what she likes and not what they like. One tells candidly that he was manipulated to study science which was not his taste. Many simply write in fewer lines that they could not fulfil the expectations of their parents. Rather few say they were not really capable of doing what is being asked for by them.

All of them thought that Death was a much peaceful and effortless action than going through this dilemma of artificially doing what parents want them to do.

As they say “Tip of the Iceberg” reveals little and hides mountains within, similarly apparent Suicide Cases reflect numbers but reality or the hidden mountain is all those children who did not opt to take this extreme step but certainly are going through stress/worry/anxiety due to pressure on performance.

Many Parents cannot believe after the disaster that it was their own child who took such a drastic measure and I don’t mean to hurt their sentiments any further but the reality is that the child was mentally looking for some blade of grass which a drowning man searches for. That blade of grass could have been your simple appreciation of his efforts… your solacing words of comforts of asking him to do his best and forget the results your absolute unconditioned appreciation of his extraordinariness.

In return, what the child got was threats of performing still better…psychological manipulation by repeat and re-telecasting of the hardships you have gone through for the sake of family. comparison with better performers (neighbors, relatives, children of colleague, ancestors…could be anyone) sharing imagination on the loss/notional gain of social status being dependent on child’ s performance.

We need to understand that statistically speaking not many children commit suicide in comparison to the total number of children coping with such academic pressure if we analyze the numbers but life analysis tells us that their hopes and dreams are overlooked and hurt many a times. So it is high time we pause and contemplate a bit. I need to take a pause here since I hear many of you saying kids do not like many things which are good for them. So the question I tend to hear from you is… Should parents go childrenâ€™s immature ways? Not necessarily.

Well let us try to see what all good things they resisted… Eating right, sleeping right, talking right, behaving right, seeing right, listening right, reading right etc.

Child actually observes parents and never follows anything blindly. Moreover, there is one thing which is certain… Child analyses and looks at the parents to see whether in case any of those things preached are followed by parents to begin with and if so..Whether their parents are really loving, joyful, peaceful and happy by doing so.

They tend to pick up only those habits of their parents that make them happy and peaceful…In case you have seriously messed up situations, your child may even not like you.

It may appear strange and extremely annoying… But there is a possibility of your child not liking you… This comes in many forms and shades. Absolute dislike, not liking few traits of yours, not liking you by comparing you with someone better, not liking you for your over protective care and concern which you may think as love but is suffocating for the child, not liking you for your double standards (we may have…) etc.

So, is it the objective of this letter to make you realise that your child dislikes you?

Answer again is a big No.. Your child does not dislike you… I am just making a point that unconsciously we may have created such a situation, which we need to undo…

Children are parents’ responsibility and we are no one to teach a parent their responsibility nor do we intend to do so… Parents really think good for their children’s future but the point I need to make is that your dreams are always limited to your experience of what is good… what is successful… what is the best thing… Well, the truth is your child may surpass your imagination and reach places which you never even dreamed of…

We all come from different segments of the society in terms of social & economic status, culture, religion, belief systems etc. However as far the natural principle of upbringing a child is concerned they remain the same everywhere.

I am not an expert in Parenting nor have many credentials in “Right Child Care Practices” and I fully understand that different kind of children need different kind of interventions yet I would request you to divert little attention to these fundamental aspects relating to child management.

Creating the right kind of atmosphere for the child to grow and flower in home by making home a really happy, loving and peaceful place to live.
Understanding the needs of the children. There are two extremes in this case…Making the child go through terrible hardships to realise “Your” dreams is one end and the other end is over-pampered care… Both of them definitely do not work.

Take time to switch from teaching mode to learning mode from the child since children show you the way to be really happy and peaceful at times…Instead of learning form them we tend to always assume the role of teacher/preacher.

Allow the child “to be” on his own terms and here I mean especially the child’s engagement with nature and world around and empower them with the right kind of communication skills which are more accommodative. Interaction with the other gender due to their coming of age is not an aberration but a normal process, which you can keep a note on but not try to prevent it totally.

Spend time with children without complaining of your office, life situation, problems, hardships all the timeâ€¦. It may be really too late before you want to spend and there is no more time available with the child. Why? Because we may have made him just like ourselves in an effort to tutor him. We certainly are not the benchmark for the child. Many a times, we may be regressive rudimentary types in comparison to the ability of the child.

Just a final thought. Are we interested in making the child realise “Your Dreams” at any cost or should it be like creating such situations that the child realises “His/Her” Dreams?

I could have simply attended a Parents Counselling Session during admission and spoken on these issues but usually it so happens that in such gatherings we are conditioned and influenced more by impression of the person sitting next to you or people who think different.

Nothing wrong in disagreeing but it is best to disagree on own terms instead of getting influenced by others. Finally, I would like to tender my unconditional apology for taking your time and telling you things about Child Management in which I am no expert and my words in this letter have been gathered by my limited experience in Kota dealing with similar cases and certainly there are great men who have inspired me to put my thoughts before you.

Be the Best Parent in the World!!!!
I am sure there is no competition there

Photography,How to deal with corrupt misbehaving customs officers at the airport?,22,4fnw6k,vitaminsboy,14,"I am not an indian but I am posting on this sub because I know people in india also have to deal with same type of corruption.  I am currently studying in a foreign country and once per year I get a chance to see my family. Last time when I went back home I had two laptops with me. One of them was my personal laptop and the other one of my university(which I have to return back at the end of my degree). Some people had told me that they are not going to charge you tax if they are used laptops. But when I arrived at the airport they asked me to pay tax on the laptops. They asked me to pay 50 dollar import tax on the 2nd laptop. I told them that they were not new laptops but used ones. While I was talking to one of the officers another guy came from behind and started shouting at me. ""WHAT IS THIS ? OPEN YOUR SUITCASE. WHAT IS THAT ? WE KNOW YOU HAVE TWO MOBILES ALSO..."" . I realized later that they were only trying to pressure me into bribing them. Of course, I did not bribe them but I ended up paying 50 dollars on something I did not even own. Keep in mind that I am a student and 50 dollars is a lot of money for me. I come from a middle class family and my scholarship pays for my university.

This year I am traveling again. Of course, this time I will not take two laptops with me but I have to take some candies and presents for my family. I wanted to take a lot of presents for my mother but because of this type of behavior I am scared of taking anything. Is there any way to deal with these people without losing your hard earned money ? The presents I am going to take will be around 2000 rupees(which is the limit). Could be a bit more than 2000 rupees. How should I respond if they behave like that again ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4fnw6k/how_to_deal_with_corrupt_misbehaving_customs/
Photography,[askindia] Am I really thinking wild? Confused. [career help],21,7gdwwd,shitheadchad,7,"I'm a 27 guy and currently working in a hectic job in a small town away from a big city with no like minded people around me or even friends to hang out. I'm stressed and with a lot of thoughts in my mind. One thought/idea ain't letting me sleep these days. I want to start a photography based business in a nearby big city. I've been in love for photography but since I've started working, I hardly get time. Don't have any like minded people around me, or even if, can't give much time. I've had a small business earlier which was unsuccessful but learnt a lot during college time. Now working for a year has got me a hang of how to deal with people, manage them, get results. 

Now coming back to my idea of photography and filmmaking business, it ain't any disruptive business but something I've loved. I have a small portfolio which ain't much impressive, not of any models in the photos but general landscape, street and travel. I don't intend to be the next fashion photographer either. So the idea is leave this work, get to the nearby city, start a photography firm with initially teaching the basics and advance of photography, not the costly ones but even college students which can afford. Side by side, also lectures from the well knowns in the field who might help me get some traction along with what I've been doing. I plan to get some amount of initial money from home for this. Pick up a few students, with some contacts, get some photography paid jobs. Get those students paid with some margin for me, get more contacts and  follow it up. The jobs I tend to initially get are concerts, photoshoots and even weddings. Photography instruments and cameras can be rented. A lot of things I feel I can do. 

But now the only fear is jumping out of my well paying hectic job at this age for something like this. How much harm will it do to my career if I fail out and if I want to go back to my work life again? How do I see the future when this field is jam packed with every photographer and film maker out there. I don't plan to bring anything different in photography but satisfied clients, good photographs and create a team which can deliver this with me. This all as happiness in what I will do and something belonging to me. 

I also thought of doing this after trying out for mba, as it might give me a cushion. Maybe help me out. But again confusing.

So how wild is this? I need some sane suggestions here, haven't asked my family or friends. 

I've not edited any part of this text, just raw, straight out of my confused mind. Please be gentle, already stressed and confused about all directions in career.

tl;dr: 27yo guy, hectic job, wants to leave for starting a photography business with not much experience and not a disruptive business but something just for happiness. Confused guy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7gdwwd/askindia_am_i_really_thinking_wild_confused/

But he is finding it difficult to find a job. He has tried everywhere but can't seem to find any good jobs. He is getting very depressed and lost interest in life. It breaks my heart to see a guy who followed his dreams and is giving up now.

#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

* Do
 * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
 * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
 * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
 * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
* Don't
 * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

Coronavirus,Help needed for a friend in Coronavirus crisis,74,fzy79t,muybien768,13,"Hi everyone, I know it's super awkward to ask for this kind of help at the moment. But one of my closest friends is stuck in Delhi (Kalkaji, South Delhi). He was returning from Ranchi to his home in Noida after giving an interview there. Unfortunately, when he returned to Delhi, the same day, all cabs/metro/buses stopped working due to strict lockdown measures. And UP border as well as Delhi was sealed. Consequently, he could not reach Noida and had to settle for getting a PG room somehow but was still living in scarcity of food etc .He tried asking for police help from both Delhi and UP police, but no help. Now, the accommodation manager has increased per day rent to around  Rs. 1200/night. And with coming summer and further scarcity of food, etc., it is becoming increasingly tough for him to manage. All his savings are nearly finished. I tried to help whatever little I could financially. And hoped that lockdown would end on April 14 and he might move back to his home. But now with lockdown further extended, chances of his survival are getting really slim. Plus, there looks no definite end to lockdown to be hopeful.

I will be extremely indebted if any of you might help at the moment. If someone has a room available in a house and can keep him for a few days, that would be seriously life saver. He can still pay something for the room, but hopefully he will get to use the kitchen or something, so that at least he gets meals once a day. 

As I said, I know it's super awkward to ask for this kind of help at the moment and probably we won't get any. But I am trying with all my luck if some miraculous solution emerge. If it helps, he was already screened for Covid at Delhi airport and was tested negative. Also, he has been mostly living alone for the past few weeks and do not have any symptoms.

If cats are too expensive, I'm thinking of going with a guinea pig or a hamster but idk how fun having one of those will be.

**Tl; dr**

In today’s speech announcing the extension of India’s national lockdown till 3rd May, 2020 the country’s Prime Minister requested citizens to [**download the** ***Aarogya Setu*** **application**](https://www.news18.com/news/tech/pm-modi-says-aarogya-setu-app-is-critical-in-the-fight-against-covid-here-is-how-it-works-2576857.html). Unfortunately, the application remains a privacy minefield and it does not adhere to principles of minimisation, strict purpose limitation, transparency and accountability. IFF’s Working Paper, analyses the application, highlights how it is inconsistent with the right to privacy, is conceivably a risk toward a permanent system of mass surveillance, and suggests clear recommendations to arrest these risks.

**Background**

On April 13, 2020 IFF released its working paper called,  “[***Privacy Prescriptions for technology interventions on COVID-19 in India***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UK5rElhcdP5T3Y-8fYP6cCgQKKpQBeOX/view)”. A significant portion of this working paper is dedicated to the proliferation of experimental contact tracing applications not just in India but across the world. India has also launched its own contact tracing solution called *Aarogya Setu*.

IFF’s working paper was alert to this and Chapters 5-7 devote significant space in studying the emergent government and non-government practices, standard setting processes and first principles in the space. Chapter 7 of the paper studies three specific models of contact tracing including the Singapore Government’s *Trace Together* application, MIT’s *Private Kit: Safe Paths* initiative, and *Aarogya Setu*.

**What is Contact Tracing?**

According to the WHO, contact tracing occurs in three steps namely (a) contact identification; (b) contact listing; and (c) contact follow up. In particular, contact tracing is a pillar which helps public health officials in containing and the pace of transmission of the virus. This pace of transmission is measured by the unit R0 (R naught) which essentially connotes the number of people an infected person can spread the disease onto.

Contact tracing has traditionally been administered through the use of on ground personnel and volunteer armies. However, with the ubiquity of smartphones, which collect vast troves of personal information, governments across the world believe surveillance can aid with rapid contact tracing. But owing to the peculiarities of the coronavirus, authorities across the world are beginning to realise the limited efficacy associated with respect to location surveillance (both with cell tower data and with GPS signals).   


As a result governments and other groups have either released or are developing smartphone apps that use Bluetooth beacons or GPS signals to log instances wherein a user’s device comes in contact with another user’s device. When a user of the app is detected to have Covid-19, contact tracing officers might be able to use the app to identify their close contacts in the prior days or weeks.  


**What’s the Risk?**   


With the creation of such systems, come new risks of institutionalisation of mass surveillance. Critically, India lacks a comprehensive data protection law, outdated surveillance and interception laws, or any meaningful proposals for meaningful reform. In domains like disaster relief,  most apps which are purported as ‘contact tracing’ technologies, they often devolve into systems of movement control and lockdown enforcement.

A lot of technology solutions with no demonstrable scientific value to the national response can be passed off as being in the public interest. It leads to poor deployment of public resources and also makes it difficult for crisis responders to discern between “snake oil” and quality technology products. These risks are exacerbated in technology markets since there are no adequate checks and balances in development phases which ensure quality.

Such systems inadvertently discriminate against regions which have fewer concentrations of smartphones. Specifically, it can lead to harmful outcomes for people residing in economically weaker areas. In countries public health systems are already creaking under the looming threat of capacity deficits. If such systems wrongly urge people to pre-emptively take tests then there is a risk that public health systems may be overwhelmed prematurely.

It may also exacerbate the risks associated with the harvesting of personal data like health information, and also see the creation of new privacy invasive systems.

**How to prevent these risks?**

Such systems must consider embedding the following principles among others:

1. The usage of these applications should be voluntary
2. All data should always be stored locally on people’s devices
3. This data must be encrypted
4. No Government can access it at a later point, so must ensure nothing is centralised in a server
5. Governments must appreciate that any data from location information, to proximity confirmations, to health status, to whether they have been placed in isolation is sensitive personal information.
6. Privacy by design is more than just assurances that phone numbers are not recorded, all data is encrypted, pseudonymisation is deployed or that the use of the app is “voluntary” and based on consent. Most of these protections have known techniques of circumvention.  


Therefore, we need to adhere to two principles:

1. Strict limits  (in terms of collection and duration )every step of the way; and
2. Comprehensive evidence-based justifications every step of the way

**Aarogya Setu compares unfavourably to Singapore and MIT**

**Is this for disease control or for other purposes?**

In other countries, health authorities are leading the efforts to respond to COVID-19. For example, in Singapore only its health ministry can use these systems or have access to any limited data/interaction which is shared with them. European authorities are making similar commitments. They assure citizens that law enforcement personnel will not have access to these systems or the data therein.

In India, multiple committees have been set up in the context of *Aarogya Setu* or other technology responses to the coronavirus. But formal notifications nor press reports have any reference to major involvement of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Instead health authorities are being tertiary institutional players.

To protect people’s right to privacy, countries (including Singapore) say that contact tracing will be used strictly for disease control and cannot be used to enforce lockdowns or quarantines. ***Aarogya Setu*** **retains the flexibility to do just that, or to ensure comply legal orders and so on**.

**Minimisation? What Minimisation?**

1. Singapore monitors people’s interactions through Bluetooth beacons, MIT does it through GPS, and **then there’s India which uses both**.
2. Other apps just collect one data point which is subsequently replaced with a scrubbed device identifier. India’s Aarogya Setu **collects multiple data points** for personal and sensitive personal information which increases privacy risks.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zy6tp8hvbss41.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9ea4b8aca61a8e38ec771f8ad785c5211b2bf17

https://preview.redd.it/mnrv4i6wbss41.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23f8c169d0699880af385910b6ee8b4799d23955

**No Transparency leads to discretion**

The only information we have of the app is its frontend and its rather pedestrian Terms of Service (TOS) and Privacy Policy. Other projects release as much information as possible in pursuit of transparency. This may include an accompanying manifesto, technical specifications, general FAQs, and even its source code. Not only does *Aarogya Setu* go the opposite route but it also prohibits external good faith actors from reverse engineering the application for further scrutiny, information security and other related research which help facilitate stability.

Similarly, the app is capable of wrongfully identifying people as COVID-19 positive as admitted in the app’s Terms of Service. We ask in our report the question in our paper, does this mean people can get diagnosed as being infected with coronavirus based on an application rather than an actual medical test? Similarly, does this mean that a false positive entails that I cannot use public transport and go to work or leave the city to visit friends? This evokes imagery of the Chinese model of surveillance during COVID-19 and we have highlighted these risks as well in the report.

**No Accountability and No Auditability**

The Government has a blanket liability limitation clause inserted into its service agreements and privacy policies. This means citizens cannot hold the Government accountable or seek judicial remedy should they wish to ensure the Government’s processes are compliant with the right to privacy.

Second, the Government talks about certain obligations to delete certain personal data from its application after a 30 day time period. However, as expected this claim comes with enough exceptions which facilitate government discretion. This is compounded with the fact that both researchers and individual users cannot actually check if the Government has deleted people’s personal information and has no means of transparently auditing what the app is doing in the backend.

**Risk of Permanence and Compromises to Autonomy | The Anonymisation Gambit**

Finally, the app runs very palpable risks of either expanding in scope or becoming a permanent surveillance architecture. People are describing the current times as 9/11 on steroids. And with 9/11 we saw the creation and proliferation of mass interception capabilities for some governments. The Government has failed to provide any defined period by when it intends to review, delete and ultimately destroy its systems and data which is collected under the *Aarogya Setu* project. Second, there are already reports which confirm that this server is being linked with other government datasets. Such linking increases risks of permanent systems of mass surveillance.

Finally, the Government says that the TOS and Privacy Policy do not apply in any capacity to what falls under the category of anonymised data sets. The government cannot just say something is anonymised and aggregated so no longer personally identifiable without showing its citizens how it is ensuring this. This level of transparency is a minimum, since the vulnerability of anonymised datasets to people’s informational privacy and security is well documented in information security communities. Considering the risk of these anonymised data sets becoming permanent systems of data analysis, the Government has to keep itself accountable to public scrutiny.

**Conclusion**

IFF has addressed all of these challenges and many more when undertaking its case studies, and the paper eventually sets out a series of 17 recommendations to ensure people’s informational privacy are protected even in these uncertain times, wherein Indian authorities are viewing civil liberties as an afterthought.

https://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fl0pdv/mark_cuban_says_bailed_out_companies_should_never/

The execs of the top US companies who have tonnes of money as it is , I'm not sure exactly, but messed up. Didn't save any money, kept reinvesting profits in their own stocks so that company value goes up and now are basically going through heavy losses and have put the jobs of citizens at risk plus they want the government to use taxpayer money to bail them out.

And from what I gather these companies will remain privatised and won't be nationalised.

There is an uproar within the US against this and a comment I really liked stated ""Why should the profits be privatised and losses be socialised"" 

Anyway, I want to know what the policies are like in India. If India has similar policies and private companies in India will go through the same thing?

What are the policies Indian government in similar situations? Is buying your own stock also legal in India? 

If someone could also explain the situation in US and in similar context the Indian economy and situation. That will be greatly appreciated.

The hospital in which he was admitted told his family that you have to announce to the media that he died of covid-19 or we won't give you the body. After several requests they gave the body after 3 days (maybe after taking a large amount of money, bribe or something).

This was only because he was a muslim and this happened in a small town where hindus have already stopped buying from muslims and vice versa.

I am an exmuslim myself but when I heard this, first of all it made me sad that such things are happening in times when humanity should stand together and fight (not literally because social distancing.

Coronavirus,Explainer: The proposed “zones” idea and why it is a disastrous one.,78,fzus0u,StorySpiral,56,"The government is apparently floating the idea to create zones of three kinds, red, orange and green. Red zones are hotspots with 15 or more cases, and there will be no activity in them. Orange zones have less than 15 cases and they will have limited public activity, like limited public transport. Green zones have no virus cases where restrictions will be relaxed. (They’ve not yet come out with a full list of relaxed restrictions in this)

My problem is a very obvious one: We are NOT testing enough. Because of this, we don’t actually have a conception of which zones are red, orange or green. That means because of the virus’ 2-week incubation period and the fact that it is asymptomatic means that there will be people roaming around without realising they are infected, causing green zones to also eventually turn orange or red.

Coronavirus,So what are the superstitions or beliefs that your family has been following in these times of Coronavirus?,19,fxtdhx,tor17no,17,"We know various kinds of superstitions or *desi nuskhe* go around on Whatsapp and our family members happily laps them up. So what are some of these quirky beliefs that your family has been following these days to be protected from the coronavirus?

For example, in my family whenever we get anything from outside, like vegetables, fruits, groceries (in sealed packets), we wash them outside our house bringing them in. First we wash them with a solution of water and baking soda/salt and then keep them to dry in the sun for an hour or two. And then the person who went out to get the stuff(which is mostly me) has to immediately take a bath and wash the clothes as well.

[Here is todays stuff in the sun after being thoroughly washed.](https://imgur.com/a/mhoGdgZ)

I don't if this would work in keeping the virus away, but atleast it gives mental peace to my family. So we probably will keep doing it for the foreseeable future.

>The last fortnight has been unusually busy for psychiatrists and mental health professionals, who are flooded with distress calls from men and women confined to their restricted spaces

Anxiety, stress, fear of consequences, loneliness, failure, uncertainty of career, and restlessness, etc are some of the complaints they seek professional solutions to.

He has been receiving calls personally on how to handle the isolation and loneliness and feels that people need to just calm down and engage themselves productively at their homes.


>Brahmananda Rao, chief operating officer, said they expect a lot of calls from alcohol addicts. “Addicts do not know who to talk to or how to handle themselves or get cured. Only a counsellor can guide them to fight addiction. We help them with remedies and choices available in government facilities. Not all need to go to the hospital.”

Coronavirus,A Gist of Indian Innovation To Combat COVID-19,10,fzjd8h,Intepat_ip,2,"The contagious COVID-19 outbreak has caused a catastrophic effect around the world. Countries are struggling to control and contain the spread of this disease. India, with its massive population, is making the best efforts to fight against the COVID-19 virus. The 21 day lockdown period has not locked down the creative minds of the researchers and engineers of our country. India supports all forms of innovations in the diagnosis, [treatment](https://www.intepat.com/blog/patent/the-global-patent-race-for-covid-19-vaccine/), prevention, and spread of COVID-19.

We keep hearing many heart-touching stories of researchers and doctors working to combat this dreadful disease. Here is a gist of what the innovation community of India is up to and how our Government supports them.

##### Innovations across the Country

###### Triple-Layered Anti-infectious Gloves 

About 8.3% of the total cases in Italy are health workers who treat and take care of infected people. A team of Indian youngsters from Viral Brain System have realized the seriousness of this issue and have designed triple-layered gloves that are anti-infectious. The gloves not only protect the user’s hands but also disinfect everything the personal touches while wearing the gloves. These gloves, once opened, can be used for a maximum period of three days. The inner and outer layers of the gloves are made of latex, while the middle layer contains the sanitizer or any disinfecting chemical. The prototype is in testing and can be expected in the market soon.

###### Anti-bacterial Clothing

[Thermaissance](https://thermaissance.com/), a startup from the GTU-incubation center, has come up with specially designed anti-bacterial clothing for hospital staff. The innovation makes use of nano silver-based technology that is capable of destroying both positive and harmful bacteria. This reduces the risk of exposure and spread of diseases among hospital staffs that are in close contact with the COVID-19 infected people. They have also come up with cheap, anti-bacterial masks tested in a NABL accredited laboratory in Mumbai for their authenticity. The masks offer 99% protection from germs even after 60 washes.

###### Colour-changing Mask

A three-layered color-changing mask to detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus is at the concept stage of innovation by the [Babaria Institute of Pharmacy](https://bitspharmacy.org/). The mask prevents the entry of Coronavirus and also acts as an indicator when exposed to the virus. The membranous layers of the mask consist of enzymes and chemical reagents that can copy DNA to RNA. When the mask comes in contact with Coronavirus particles, the mask constituents react with the virus and form a solid pink color. The change in color will indicate exposure to the virus.

###### 3-D Printed Toothbrush

The innovation from the startup, Pragratham, addresses the importance of oral hygiene in the survival rate of corona virus-infected persons. This toothbrush is specially designed for COVID-19 patients in ICU. This open-source design requires a 3-D printer and cotton gauze to construct the toothbrush. It takes an hour and 45 minutes to produce a single 3-D printed toothbrush. The product has received positive feedback when tested.

###### The Quarantine Watch App

The senior IAS officer Munish Moudgil with his team in Karnataka has launched India’s first unique mobile app to facilitate active tracking of people in quarantine. The application works on both android and iPhone platforms. The home-quarantined person should download the app, fill in essential personal details, and send selfies. The system will identify good resolution selfies, and officials from the District Photo Verification team will check for the originality of the selfie. The application has also enabled GPS tracking to trace their whereabouts effectively.

###### Online Training Programme

The Karnataka Government has launched a 1.30-2.00 hour training programme to train doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The programme is freely accessible on YouTube. The programme helps doctors to prepare themselves and also teach them on specimen collection and transport, clinical management, and supportive therapy for COVID-19 patients.

###### Sanitization Units

PadCare Labs, a Pune-based startup, has designed a sanitization unit to disinfect the surface area. The unit working on the principle of UV mechanism can disinfect an area of 80 sq ft with a 99.99% bacterial reduction in 15 minutes. The organization will be installing the units in a local hospital soon.

###### C-CAMPs Initiatives

The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Platforms ([C-CAMP](http://www.ccamp.res.in/)) has launched COVID-19 Innovations Deployment Accelerator (CIDA) to identify and support innovations that help in combating Coronavirus. The program has partnered with Social Alpha, United Nations Health Innovation Exchange (UNHIE), India2022 Xynteo, India Health Fund, MedTechConnect, AIC-CCMB, and CCMB to select innovations and develop them to large scale applications. The companies with projects towards the following criteria were nominated for funding.

###### Preventative Measures

[Anabio](https://www.anabio.ie/) Technologies Pvt Ltd works on innovating new preventative technologies that offer better protection than the existing ones. The technology from this company aims to transform a mask or a regular cotton cloth into a protective agent against Coronavirus. This technology will work on meeting the needs of N95 masks and other personal protective equipment.

###### Diagnostics

There is a rising need in India to perform mass-testing to identify and isolate people infected with COVID-19. CoSara Diagnostics Pvt Ltd and Ampligene Diagnostics Pvt Ltd are working on developing easy-to-use, affordable, quick, and accurate diagnostic technologies.

###### Respiratory Devices

5-10% of the Indian population will require ICU in the event of community spread in India. There is a rising need for invasive and non-invasive respirators to treat critically ill patients. US FDA has approved the use of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machines (CPAP) to meet the scarcity of ventilators. Coeo Labs and Avyantra are working on innovations in the mass production of respirators to achieve this scenario.

Many such innovations are going around in the nook and corner of our country to fight back COVID-19. Our Government has also launched several incubation programmes to encourage innovators working on combating this dreadful disease. The active contribution from young [entrepreneurs](https://www.intepat.com/blog/intellectual-property/intellectual-property-rights/) and researchers is inevitable to serve our country during this massive health crisis.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzjd8h/a_gist_of_indian_innovation_to_combat_covid19/

Coronavirus,India to extend lockdown by 2 weeks,13,fz4rsf,TheRobotsHaveCome,2,"India is set to extend its nationwide lockdown for another two weeks, until April 30, as its confirmed coronavirus caseload continues to soar, with no sign that the severe restrictions on most economic activities have flattened the curve.  India confirmed its highest ever daily number of infections at 1,035 over the past 24 hours, health ministry officials said. This brings the total number of confirmed coronavirus patients to nearly 7,500. Of those, 642 have recovered, and 239 have died.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi engaged in a four-hour dialogue with chief ministers of Indian states on Saturday to discuss whether to lift the lockdown, which has caused extreme hardships to India’s hundreds of millions of casual and informal sector workers, whose incomes have collapsed since the restrictive measures were introduced on March 22.  Mr Modi made no official statement or comment after the meeting concluded. But Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of New Delhi, made it clear that the lockdown would not be lifted on April 14, when it is currently due to expire. Mr Modi is expected to address the nation on Sunday or Monday night about the extension.  Analysts and industries expect that Mr Modi may announce some relaxation of the restrictions for farmers, who are poised to harvest their annual winter wheat crop. Industrial businesses, especially exporters, are also hoping for some relaxation for manufacturers so they can maintain the supply of essential items, and fulfil international orders.  However, all India’s public transportation systems -- including urban metros rails, the railway network, and all domestic and international passenger flights -- are likely to remain suspended.

Coronavirus,"The need to investigate the NSO Group, which was behind the Pegasus software, is now more than ever.",68,fyawr9,InternetFreedomIn,4,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p3vb8eexzxr41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a80eb8a5aafc7092e4017557ca41921f18c872f1

**Tl;dr**

According to a Hindustan Times [**report**](https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/pegasus-creator-nso-group-has-a-covid-19-software-why-you-should-be-worried/story-SMsYXKFoz9OPG2VBIKrA8L.html) dated April 07, 2020, the NSO Group has created a surveillance application to track COVID-19 infected patients which they have been actively pitching to almost a dozen governments around the world to use. This is the same company which was behind the Pegasus software that was used to hack the Whatsapp applications of a substantial number of Indian citizens mainly journalists and human rights activists in May and June of 2019. Mindful of the potential harms of this COVID-19 application being used by the Indian government, we wrote to the Chief Ministers of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh urging them to establish committees to investigate the Whatsapp hack. Our key recommendations were to include victim and expert testimony in the investigation which should be carried out in a transparent manner.   


**What happened?**

Last year on May 14, 2019, an [**article**](https://www.ft.com/content/4da1117e-756c-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab) published in the Financial Times for the first time reported that Whatsapp, “discovered that attackers were able to install surveillance software on both iPhones and Android phones by ringing up targets using the app’s phone call function.” As per a statement by Whatsapp, this vulnerability was patched and closed. On October 30, 2019, Indian Express published a [**report**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/whatsapp-confirms-israeli-spyware-used-snoop-on-indian-journalists-activists-pegasus-facebook-6095296/) containing statements made by Whatsapp which confirmed that the victims of the hack in India were mostly Indian journalists and human rights activists. Of these a significant number are situated in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh as the hack targeted lawyers related to the Bhima-Koregaon case in Maharashtra and Dalit activists in Chhattisgarh.   


**What is the law related to hacking?**

Surveillance such as this which was carried through the Pegasus software developed by the NSO Group puts the personal and informational privacy of citizens at risk. This goes against the decision in J*ustice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India* which affirms informational privacy as one of the facets of the right to privacy.   


Additionally, the Information Technology Act, which deals with interception of data, expressly prohibits hacking. Under S. 66 of the Act, hacking is a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may extend to five lakh rupees or with both.  


**Attempts at reputation laundering by the NSO Group**

We are bringing this up again right now because we are especially concerned about the operations of the NSO Group in India. It was reported in the Hindustan Times on April 07, 2020 that NSO has now developed a surveillance app to track the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The report also said that the NSO Group  is “actively pitching surveillance tools to their governments and to others around the world.”   


It was not made clear whether NSO has approached the Indian Government. However, since the NSO Group has already been accused of illegal surveillance, privacy experts are of the opinion that the company might try to exploit this crisis to market intrusive systems. [**The coronavirus pandemic presents a golden opportunity for corporate actors  like the NSO Group to recast previously unpalatable behavior as life saving intervention.**](https://theintercept.com/2020/04/02/coronavirus-covid-19-surveillance-privacy/)  


**Our recommendations**

1. We recommend that the State governments of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh should establish an investigation committee to look into the hack committed in their state.
2. The Committee should have a fixed timeline in which to complete its investigation and submit its report to the State governments.
3. The Committee should allow for the victims (or legal counsel on their behalf) of the hack to testify before it.
4. The Committee should allow experts in the field of data privacy to testify before it.
5. The Committee should facilitate the registration of open FIRs and encourage that investigations are commenced immediately.
6. The Committee should operate in a transparent manner.

Policy/Economy,"Questions about Indian billionaires, Private Indian companies, government policies and economy with respect to Coronavirus",8,fz873c,VizKaz,0,"I read this post highlighting Mark Cubans views of US government bailing out private companies. 

https://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fl0pdv/mark_cuban_says_bailed_out_companies_should_never/

The execs of the top US companies who have tonnes of money as it is , I'm not sure exactly, but messed up. Didn't save any money, kept reinvesting profits in their own stocks so that company value goes up and now are basically going through heavy losses and have put the jobs of citizens at risk plus they want the government to use taxpayer money to bail them out.

And from what I gather these companies will remain privatised and won't be nationalised.

There is an uproar within the US against this and a comment I really liked stated ""Why should the profits be privatised and losses be socialised"" 

Anyway, I want to know what the policies are like in India. If India has similar policies and private companies in India will go through the same thing?

What are the policies Indian government in similar situations? Is buying your own stock also legal in India? 

If someone could also explain the situation in US and in similar context the Indian economy and situation. That will be greatly appreciated.

Policy/Economy,We would have gone into a recession regardless of a virus (PART RANT),84,fupeo0,abbawaddadu,21,"People seem to forget we already had major financial issues that no one is really highlighting. Such as the bad rollout of Demonetization, the ILFS issue leading to an NPA issue, the slow growth of the real estate industry in certain metropolitan areas. The consolidation of banks, the issues with Yes bank and the impending NBFC crisis. On top of it Air India's bad performance and a bunch of real issues that have happened over the past 5 years internationally such as the trade war, Brexit and currently the oil war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.

The Virus isn't something that would have wrecked the economy itself it's something that multiplying the impact of the already existing issues. The situation is right now not similar to 2008 because that situation was a fundamental shift in what we thought was right. This is a trust issue in the markets and economics. There is a mistrust between the stakeholders of commerce.

We will get out of this virus eventually and the markets will recover. The stock markets are drama queens that are sensitive to everything. If Trumps stupid words could trigger a downward trend, then imagine what would have happened if shit actually hit the fan. Remember all the loss of wealth is imaginary in sort as it's based on perceptions. You haven't actually lost the money as long as you don't book your losses. For a person who had invested 5-6 years back in a stock, he or she had lost an opportunity profit but nothing was ever promised. That's why all these instruments come with terms and conditions.

If a share falls by 30% that doesn't mean that a company with really good fundamentals and performance track will lose 30% of their intrinsic value over minutes. On the other hand if a company was extremely leveraged and had pre-existing skeletons in the closet, it""s going to be horrible for them. This time is more of a period of companies opening up and being honest about their positions and less of a China propoganda or lockdown bad thing.

It's sad to see people lose their jobs but it doesn't matter weather 1 million lose their jobs every year or 6 mill in one freak event but it was going to happen eventually. There is a fundamental demand side shock that has happened in India tracing far back as 2016. It's ironic that the enemies and black money hoarders of the economy, the informal sector, your vegetable vendors, your kirana shops your local chai walla, are currently the world managing and actually saving local district microeconomic commerce with their supply chains and flexibility. 

Right now the world is in an icu and we are paying a massive hospital bill not because of the disease but because of lack of investment in the essentials like infrastructure, healthcare and education. The investment was directed towards other fancier things because it seemed cool or a matter of izzat to do so at the time. I hope after all this is done people don't forget about the local kirana shops and supply chain guys who managed to keep things running.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fupeo0/we_would_have_gone_into_a_recession_regardless_of/

Policy/Economy,[Policy] Creating Jobs in the Indian Economy,161,66u52j,ringtring,82,"An AskIndia thread asked the same question. I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I'll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction. Writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself.

Please note I'm only looking at the big picture. I'm not trying to minimize the suffering of lakhs, just want to get an overall view of DeMo and its effects on the economy, black money and the tax base.

**The Good:**

* Under the new Amnesty scheme,  ₹4900 crores of unaccounted income was declared by around 21000 people. (Source - [Rs 4,900 crore black money disclosed under PMGKY, Rs 2,451 crore tax collected from it)](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/black-money-rs-4900-crore-disclosed-under-pmgky-rs-2451-crore-tax-collected-income-tax/story/259891.html)
* Over 2 lakh shell companies (corporations that exists only on paper and are often linked to money laundering and movement of black money) were struck off by the government, rendering them illegal. (Source - [India Cancels 2.24 Lakh Suspected Shell Companies Post Demonetisation](https://www.bloombergquint.com/law-and-policy/india-cancels-224-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation))
* In similar but separate action, around 3.09 lakh board of directors were disqualified for their companies failing to file financial statements and/or annual reports for a continuous period of three financial years. (Source - [Govt cancelled 2.24 lakh suspected shell companies post demonetisation, disqualified 3.09 lakh directors](https://www.firstpost.com/business/govt-cancelled-2-24-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation-disqualified-3-09-lakh-directors-4194085.html))
* 48 per cent increase in deposits in Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) accounts, with addition of 18 million accounts post-demonetisation (November 9 to January 25, 2017). The latest data indicate that 38.2 million new accounts were opened until July 26, 2017 since demonetisation. (Source - [Demonetisation and Bank Deposit Growth](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/MSM_Demonetisation.aspx))
* India witnessed a great jump in the account ownership during 2014-2017 as 80 percent Indians owned a bank account in 2017; there were only 35 percent bank account holders in 2011. Please note this is in(significant) part due to the PMJDY accounts. (Source - [55 percent of all new bank accounts in the world opened from India: Global Findex Report 2017](https://www.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/19-crore-indian-adults-do-not-have-bank-accounts-global-findex-report-2017-1524203973-1))
* Several measures taken to improve transparency in the gold market, including GST have seen a shift from off-book transactions to accounted transactions (Source - [Demonetisation, GST impact: India is fast ceding gold market share to China](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/demonetisation-gst-impact-india-is-fast-ceding-gold-market-share-to-china-118050300388_1.html))
* Much more transparency in the real estate segment which is rife with black money dealings. DeMo paved the way for new acts such as the RERA which further increase transparency. The immediate drop in the prices in real estate (\~30%) can be attributed to black money not playing such a big part anymore (Source - [Demonetisation impact: Real estate sector still recovering from the jolt](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/demonetisation-impact-real-estate-sector-still-recovering-from-the-jolt-2432723.html)). The real estate segment seems to recovering from the jolt, but now with much higher accountability. (Source -  [Impact of demonetisation on real estate recedes](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/impact-of-demonetisation-on-real-estate-recedes-117061400058_1.html))
* Direct Tax collection has increased siginificantly due to DeMo. Corporate income tax grew at 14% and Personal income tax grew at 13%. Net collections increased by 17.1% in FY18 and 14.6% in FY17, despite income tax rates staying mostly the same in the last couple of years. Since the note ban, direct tax buoyancy doubled from 0.6 times in FY16 to 1.3 times in FY17 and accelerated further to 1.7 times in FY18.  (Source - ['Direct tax collection up since demonetisation'](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/direct-tax-collection-up-since-demonetisation/articleshow/69077749.cms) and [What demonetisation did to tax collections](https://www.thehindu.com/business/what-demonetisation-did-to-tax-collections/article23550004.ece))

**The Bad:**

* Labourers in the textile, footwear, plastic and metal industry have been adversely affected by the demonetisation move.Labourers in the organised and unorganised sectors bore the biggest brunt of this move. In the time since the note-ban, over 50 lakh men have lost their jobs. The unemplyment rate hit a 45-year high of 6.1 percent in 2018. (Source - [50 lakh people lost jobs since demonetisation, says Azim Premji University report](https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/jobs/50-lakh-people-lost-jobs-since-demonetisation-says-azim-premji-university-report/story/337980.html))
* In the immediate aftermath of DeMo, MSME's were the most badly affected. Small businesses with no access to PoS machines suffered during the immediate aftermath. This inadvertently led to the bigger players overpowering the market. (Source - [Demonetisation: Indian SMEs suffered a blow, still struggling to find their footing](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/demonitisation-indian-smes-suffered-a-blow-still-struggling-to-find-their-footing/articleshow/61541952.cms?from=mdr))
* The manufacturing segment was hit pretty hard. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 49.6, indicating a contraction. Cash flow issues battered the entire sector, leading to lower employment, reduction in production activity and rise in input costs. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) saw just a 4.9% growth in November, compared to 6.6 percent in October. (Source - [Demonetisation hits manufacturing sector](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Demonetisation-hits-manufacturing-sector/article16979062.ece))
* Agriculture was one of the worst hit sectors. The Ministry of Agriculture acknowledged that due to the lack of cash, millions of farmers were unable to purchase seeds and fertilisers ahead of the rabi season. Due to the shortage of cash, about 1.38 lakh quintals of wheat seeds of the national seed corporation were not even sold. Sale, transport, marketing and distribution of ready produce to wholesale centres or mandis, is dominantly cash-dependent. Disruptions, breaks in the supply chains feedback to farmers as sales fall, increased wastage of perishables, lower revenues that show up as trade dues instead of cash in hand and when credited into bank accounts with limited access affect the sector. Incomes and profit margins were hit hard. (Source - [Demonetization: The impact on agriculture](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/B1vFTOgwqHjdM5nkmg2CxJ/Demonetization-The-impact-on-agriculture.html))
* The rural and informal economy suffered disproportionately as most of the transactions are cash-based. The pile up at wholesale markets lead to a sharp decline in the Wholesale price index (WPI) of perishables in the immediate aftermath of DeMo. (Source - [How demonetisation affected the Indian economy, in 10 charts](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/ySbMKTIC4MINsz1btccBJO/How-demonetisation-affected-the-Indian-economy-in-10-charts.html))
* A systemic liquidity crunch was created due to the note ban leading to massive disruption in the supply and demand of several goods. The performance of the equity markets saw a sharp reversal, but recovered quickly enough. (Source - [INDIAN DEMONETIZATION AND THE LIQUIDITY CONUNDRUM](https://insight.factset.com/indian-demonetization-and-the-liquidity-conundrum))
* Economic growth slowed to 6.1 percent, a loss of 2-3 percent. Please note we were already on the cusp of an economic slowdown and the subsequent measures such as DeMo and GST further aggravated the issue. (Source - [Demonetisation hit growth by 2 percentage points: US Study](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/demonetisation-hit-growth-by-2-percentage-points-us-study/articleshow/67154320.cms))

**The Ugly:**

* The excercise led to the death of several people, and caused immeasurable distress to a significant percentage of the population. I don't feel the need to go into detail as this is not the point of this post.

A couple more points I'd like to add:

* Just because **99.3%** of the cash in circulation prior to DeMo has returned to the system doesn't mean that the excercise was a complete failure. The issue of black money was tackled on several fronts. I believe the main point of DeMo was never to take out a significant chunk of currency out of rotation (despite what the government says). I believe the government got everyone on the black-money bandwagon as a way to make people feel that they personally were helping in the fight against black money. Again, just my theory.
* I believe the true purpose of DeMo was to bring **more transparency and accountability** to the economic system, in addition to making more and more of India **tax compliant and a part of the formal economy.** I do believe that the informal sector plays a very important role, particularly in the times of economic crisis, but that's a story for another day.

Summing up, I'd like to point out that DeMo can neither be categorized as a success or a failure. It has its place, in the grey, neither black nor white as some people believe. That's the point of my post.

The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today’s situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. 

This pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?

Businesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren’t performing. 

Remarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. 

A critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**

Studies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, “Out of Adversity comes Opportunity”. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. 

Real Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.

**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**

1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.

2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.

3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   
 (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.

4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.

5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.

While the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: 

 **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‘Home’ is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. 

**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector’s growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India’s GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector’s contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India’s GDP by 2025.

· **Real Estate – Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India’s Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**

· **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.

· **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. 

· **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.

· **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.

· **Long Term “Assured” Wealth Building Asset with “Predictable “ Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **“Predictable” Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an “Assured” Capital Appreciation in long term**, don’t be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company’s stock price or your bank’s health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own 

· **“Helps you Raise Money Quickly”** \- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!

· **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \- **“Wine and Real Estate improve with Age”** \- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!

· **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.

· **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.

· **Co-living market** size across India’s top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.

· **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.

· India’s improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.

**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**

Probably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why –**

1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.

2. **Low Demand – Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.

3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.

4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.

5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.

6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.

7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it’s time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.

**Final Thoughts:** 

**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**

\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, 

\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, 

\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly 

\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... 

Simply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process

**The Bottom Line**

**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**

Real estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor’s portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual’s cash flow and wealth.

**“BUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don’t WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**

The taxes on Petrol and Diesel have grown by over 100% in the tenure of Modi government. While the other big economies are trying to ensure that they do not go in economic slump by easing their monetary policy, India is busy dampening consumer confidence.

This news closely follows another one where the Modi government fired Urjit PATEL for not financing 1.56L crores worth of government expenditure.

The markets are reeling heavily downwards under pressure due to C scare, and it is very likely that the investors will pull out their investments from higher risk based emerging economies. In a looming recession, the growth can flee and the institutional investors may pull out in hoards.

The Indian banks are failing and the modi government is further dampening the consumer confidence by raising taxes on staple like Petrol. The recent drop in oil prices was perfect opportunity for the government to announce a reduction.

This mass exodus of migrant workers is what happens when a government is myopic to the point of blindness. A proper plan could and would have prevented this. A proper stimulus package planned in advance, and not one quickly put together in reaction to this, should have been there. This mass exodus has many, many, many problems surrounding it. For one, can you imagine people turning into nomads overnight when food and water that's usually available everywhere is missing thanks to a lockdown? Can you imagine, how these men, women, and children are supposed to *walk* hundreds of kilometers in absence of public transport? It's beyond cruel what the Centre has compelled these already oppressed groups of people to do right now. These migrant workers will also (many already are) face the brutality of lathi-happy cops. With state borders locked, they will essentially remain nomads, unless proper arrangements are made for them.  And, worst of all, these migrant workers, who don't have the luxury to wash hands for twenty seconds with soaps (can't afford soaps, can't afford to waste what little water they have), how are they supposed to remain safe from the pandemic? It's also equally likely that they make take the coronavirus along with them to their villages. And let's not forget that rural public healthcare is already in shambles. Those rushing to fellate the prime minister for his ""brave"" and ""strong"" step do not fucking understand how this lockdown has already disrupted the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.

Policy/Economy,Opinion: BJPs policies have alienated a large section of Middle Class Hindus,138,f15kgm,Sulh-i-kul,55,"One of India's Election Commissioners, Ashok Lavasa, in a brilliant [recent ](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-difficulty-of-being-honest-prevention-of-corruption-act-ashok-lavasa-election-commission-of-india-6188078/)article  wrote,""People are generally good; they are also generally timid"". And I think it defines our middle classes perfectly.

India has always had an aspirational middle class. This middle class is largely moderate, driven by ambitions of economic prosperity and social stability (just like the middle classes of any other country). They want to be socially and economically upwardly mobile, resent overtly divisive policies with uncertain ends and are busy in their lives (thus the timidity).

Now, the point of a democratic society is democratic changes (a.k.a gradual changes). There's a reason we're regarded as elephants and China's as a dragon. We praise China for what they've done with their economy but hold dear what we have i.e our voice.

Modi Govt seems to be constantly stirring the pot with radical policies. This has started affecting the lives of a common Indian more than ever, and negatively too. Modi supporter or not, demonetisation, for example, in hindsight, is uniformly chided for being wasteful and avoidable.

Middle and lower middle classes will now increasingly start disassociating with what this govt stands for. The CAA crackdown, kashmir situation but most importantly the incompetent handling of the economy will soon have them looking for viable alternatives. A BJP, which for the longest time stood for economic liberalisation, corruption-free politics, efficient governance - atleast in the minds of the educated - now stands exposed with its vitriolic campaigns and its ineptitude to handle nuanced issues like the Kashmir problem. 

I see a political vacuum forming soon, and a desperate search for alternatives by the upwardly mobile middle and lower middle classes and an opportunity for something new.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f15kgm/opinion_bjps_policies_have_alienated_a_large/

It picks up bluetooth signals that it comes in contact with. So even if the person standing next to you has this installed, and you don't have your bluetooth hidden, your location is noted and added to the social graph.

Policy/Economy,"Economists of r/India , can you give your views or comments on inflation in India and it's relationship to unemployment . Read details below",7,g141sz,ParmanuMan,2,"Recently , I was reading an article on inflation and unemployment

>A.W. Phillips was one of the first economists to present compelling evidence of the inverse relationship between unemployment and wage inflation. Phillips studied the relationship between unemployment and the rate of change of wages in the United Kingdom over a period of almost a full century (1861-1957), and he discovered that the latter could be explained by (a) the level of unemployment and (b) the rate of change of unemployment.

>Phillips hypothesized that when demand for labor is high and there are few unemployed workers, employers can be expected to bid wages up quite rapidly. However, when demand for labor is low, and unemployment is high, workers are reluctant to accept lower wages than the prevailing rate, and as a result, wage rates fall very slowly.

>A second factor that affects wage rate changes is the rate of change in unemployment. If business is booming, employers will bid more vigorously for workers, which means that demand for labor is increasing at a fast pace (i.e., percentage unemployment is decreasing rapidly), than they would if the demand for labor were either not increasing (e.g., percentage unemployment is unchanging) or only increasing at a slow pace.

Does this mean the current government's quest for low inflation is indirectly leading to unemployment going up .

Low inflation means companies and investors have no initiative to invest . However during times of inflation , investors look for places to invest their money in since it will keep on losing its  value if it kept ideal .

During Congress years of 2004-2014 , high inflation also most probably lead to increased consumer spending and expenditure. Since a large sector of Indian economy is dependent on internal consumption , it experienced significant growth due to it 


The reserve bank of India has been also extremely focused on fighting inflation . Many people are saying that this obsession with inflation is causing them to keep interest rates too high , as a result of which private companies have no initiative to borrow loans for new ventures


>As these examples of hyperinflation show, states have a powerful incentive to keep price rises in check. For the past century in the U.S., the approach has been to manage inflation using monetary policy. To do so, the Federal Reserve (the U.S. central bank) relies on the relationship between inflation and interest rates. If interest rates are low, companies and individuals can borrow cheaply to start a business, earn a degree, hire new workers, or buy a shiny new boat. In other words, low rates encourage spending and investing, which generally stoke inflation in turn.By raising interest rates, central banks can put a damper on these rampaging animal spirits

Policy/Economy,"Delhi Government today raised the minimum wage to highest for any state in the country, after SC ruled in their favour. Almost 3 times as much as UP. Will immediately benefit 55 lakh workers.",284,dooafc,kash_if,102,"Delhi government had tried to raise the minimum wage in 2017 but this had been taken to court by a number of associations of employers. High Court ordered against the hike in 2018, which was then appealed to Supreme Court. 

Delhi government then constituted a Minimum Wage Advisory Committee in November 2018 that finalised the wages. This amounts to Rs14,842/month for unskilled workers, which was submitted before the Supreme Court. The SC has now accepted Delhi Government's proposal. 

Comparison with some other states:

> Delhi ₹14842

> Haryana ₹8827

> UP ₹5750

> Gujarat ₹8190

> Maharashtra ₹10411

> [National Minimum Wage](https://thewire.in/labour/delhi-minimum-wake-hike) ₹ 4,576 (recommended, but not implemented ₹9,750) 

Of course Delhi has a higher cost of living, but I can't imagine other cities like Lucknow being 3 times cheaper. Therefore other state governments also need to look at their wages and revise them. 


> A Bench of Justices U.U. Lalit and Aniruddha Bose, in an order passed on October 14, permitted the Delhi government to bring into effect its draft proposal to revise minimum wages of unskilled labourers to ₹14,842, ₹16,341 for semi-skilled, ₹17,991 for skilled workers, ₹16,341 for non-matriculates, ₹17,991 for matriculates who are not graduates and ₹19,572 for graduates and above.

> In an affidavit filed on August 26 this year, the Delhi government said it has proposed the revised minimum wages taking into consideration “the average prices of food items and clothing component and other prescribed percentage of other components i.e. housing, light & fuel and education/social obligation”.

Policy/Economy,Moody’s lowers India’s GDP growth forecast to 5.3 per cent in 2020 on coronavirus implications on the economy.,60,fk0dx5,drgnfly61,3," Moody’s Investors Service on Tuesday lowered India’s GDP growth forecast for 2020 calendar year to 5.3 per cent, on coronavirus implications on the economy.  

 February projected a 5.4 per cent real GDP growth for India in 2020. This too was a downgrade from 6.6 per cent earlier forecast. 

 “A number of governments and central banks have announced countervailing measures, including fiscal stimulus packages, policy rate cuts and regulatory forbearance; however, the effectiveness of policy easing will be blunted by measures to contain the outbreak, and policy space is constrained for some sovereigns,” 

 Moody’s said oil price shock adds to growth and fiscal pressures for exposed sovereigns. “A period of lower oil prices will further weigh on the economic and fiscal fundamentals of oil exporters, while mitigating the trade shock for importers.”

Policy/Economy,Why Russia in the Revolution of 1905 is analogous to India today,6,fjkxnm,Desipornthrowaway,8,"Russia in 1905 was controlled by a very hated Tsar. He was in control only because he controlled the police and media. The courts were also controlled by him and thus no real justice was possible. 

Ring a bell? Read on. 

He ruled only for the vested big industry and land owners. They made policies and he simply was their puppet. Farmers were in distress and yes you also had farmer suicide but the Tsar didn't care because his sycophants told him he was the best Tsar ever and that the Economy and people were in great shape?

 Ding ding ding. 

Now in 1904 and 1905 began a series of mass democratic protests, all inorganic and a will of the people. Did the Tsar listen to them? No, he ignored them at best and at worst unleashed his army and police on unarmed masses murdering them by the 1,000's. 

You have made the connection haven't you. 

As this was all making the Tsar look bad, a group of fascists called the Black Hundreds, supported by the police came up. Like the RSS today they were a fascist mob who used the support of the state to silence dissenting voices by violence. Now go read about them and you will see that they mirror the RSS exactly. A summary from Wikipedia. 

>The Black Hundreds were also noted for extremism and incitement to pogroms, nationalistic Russocentric doctrines, different xenophobic beliefs, including anti-Ukrainian sentiment[4] and anti-semitism.

Replace russocentric with Hindutva and anti Ukrainian with Bangladesh and semitism with Islam and you have the exact same Ideology. 

Whenever a peaceful protest came up, these thugs will show up, murder the peace loving protestors while the police turned a blind eye. 

This is exactly the same as India under the Fascist thug Modi.  

I do hope that the people rise up and eventually overthrow him, restoring the rule of democracy we had before him.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fjkxnm/why_russia_in_the_revolution_of_1905_is_analogous/

Policy/Economy,Lives & livelihoods in India,7,fzfkko,Nawin1993,1,"Lives and livelihoods

Context:

The Prime Minister, while announcing the lockdown had to decide between saving lives and ensuring livelihoods. He rightly privileged the former over the latter then. As India nears the end of the lockdown period, the serious damage to the economy and livelihoods is beginning to make itself apparent. The editorial talks about various measures to manage the unprecedented crisis on the economic front.  

Issues:

There is tremendous pressure from industry bodies to opt for a nuanced policy that will help economic activity to restart.
They fear a collapse if activity is stopped for another fortnight.
Lives could be lost to hunger and livelihoods sacrificed in the lockdown.
Way ahead:

One way to sidestep this existential dilemma is by bringing on a second round of an economic relief package that goes well beyond the first both in terms of the financial commitment and the spread. 
The ₹1.7-lakh crore package announced by Finance Minister was a good start but barely accounted for 1% of GDP. India should spend at least 5% of GDP for now — about ₹10-lakh crore. 
The cash transfers to the poor should be hiked to at least ₹3,000 a month for the next three months. This should be in addition to free rations and cooking gas, as was announced earlier.
Out-of-the-box ideas for delivering support and also for raising the required funds might be required. 
The government should let go off fiscal conservatism and go all out to spend and support the economy. Economists are unanimous that there is little option now but to print money and spend (what the developed countries are doing).
In the harvest season, farmers need logistical support for moving their produce to markets.
Lenders, including NBFCs, should be granted freedom to reschedule their loan accounts so that borrowers are not under pressure to repay for fear of turning delinquent. 
A credit guarantee fund that will support non-delinquent borrowers for the next six months will be a good option. 
Such a fund can be financed through a domestic bond offering. 
The bankruptcy code should be suspended for the next six months, at least for MSMEs. 
A GST holiday for the next three months would be a good option.
The loss of revenue will be ₹3-lakh crore at worst, but in reality will be much lower than that because economic activity is at a standstill now. 
Such a move will ease cash flows for business and also obviate the need for statutory compliances at a time when the focus will have to be on getting businesses back on track. 


Conclusion:

The crisis now is without precedent and the solutions must not be conservative. Generous support from the government, and quickly delivered, is the need of the hour.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzfkko/lives_livelihoods_in_india/

### 1) SARS-­CoV-­2 

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer­reviewed, open­access journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS­-CoV-­2, the virus causing the COVID-­19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-­2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

### 2) G20 Meeting in Saudi Arabia

* Recently, the ministers and central bankers from the world’s largest economies participated in the G20 meeting held in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia).
* It was presided by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the first Arab nation to hold the G20 presidency.
* The 2020 G20 Presidency will focus discussions, forums, working groups and Ministerial Meetings under the theme of “Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All”.

#### Key Points

* Global Economy:
   * The global economic growth remains slow and downside risks due to the geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty.
   * Though the economic growth is expected to increase in 2020 and 2021 due to loose monetary policy and an easing of trade tensions.
* IMF’ Views at the Meeting:
   * It projects a “V-shaped, rapid recovery” for the global economy, but it warns about the uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19).
   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

### 3) International Judicial Conference 2020

The International Judicial Conference 2020 was held from 21st-23rd February 2020 in New Delhi.

* The Conference was organized by the Supreme Court of India.

* Gender Justice: The recent directives for granting equal status to women in the Army, guidelines for preventing sexual harassment at the workplace, etc. were appreciated.
* Global Reference: The Chief Justice of India said that the Supreme Court’s judgments are cited by courts of other countries and have served as a “beacon of hope” to independent and developing nations.
   * A 2001 verdict of the South African court cited the Indian case of Narain Das Jain v Agra Nagar Mahapalika decided by the Supreme Court in 1991 to benchmark the compensation to be provided while acquiring land.
* Use of ICT: The need for technology was highlighted to deliver speedy justice.
* The Government is making an effort to connect every court of the country to the E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project. The establishment of the National Judicial Data Grid will make court procedures easier.
* Future Challenges: It was highlighted that issues like data protection and cybercrimes pose new challenges for the judiciary.

#### E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project

* The E-Courts Project was conceptualized based on the ""National Policy and Action Plan for Implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the Indian Judiciary - 2005"" submitted by the e-Committee of the Supreme Court of India (set up in 2004).
* The main objectives of the e-Court Project are as follows:
   * To provide efficient & time-bound citizen-centric service delivery.
   * To develop, install & implement decision support systems in courts.
   * To automate the processes to provide transparency of Information access to its stakeholders.
   * To enhance judicial productivity both qualitatively & quantitatively, to make the justice delivery system affordable, accessible, cost-effective & transparent.
* The e-Courts National portal (ecourts.gov.in) was launched in 2013. This provides Case Status, daily Case-list, Cases Filed and Cases Registered through the Case information System (CIS) Software.
* The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is a part of the e-Courts Integrated Mission Mode Project. It was launched in 2015. The aim is to track judicial performance across different courts in the country.
   * The NJDG is working as a National data warehouse for case data including the orders/judgments for Courts across the country.
   * NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage & reduce pendency of cases.
   * It also helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delay and arrears in the system, facilitate better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, facilitate better resource management.
   * NJDG has specifically helped India improve its ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report.

### 4) Craspedotropis Gretathunbergae

A group of scientists has recently discovered a new species of land snail in Brunei.

* The new species reside in tropical rainforests and are sensitive to drought and extreme temperatures (which have become more frequent due to climate change).
* Hence as an honor to Swedish Climate Change activist Greta Thunberg, who has been making efforts to raise awareness about climate change, the new snail species was named Craspedotropis Gretathunbergae.
* Recently, a tiny species of beetle was also named after her as Nelloptodes Greta.
* In 2018, a new species of beetle (Grouvellinus Leonardodicaprioi) was named after the actor Leonardo DiCaprio (an American actor, producer, and environmentalist).

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

### 7) World’s largest cavefish discovered in Meghalaya

A team of experts from the UK, Switzerland, and India have discovered the world’s largest species of cavefish in Meghalaya’s Jaintia Hills.

#### About

* The cavefish, similar in anatomy to an endangered mahseer species, is around one and a half feet in length and was found inside a remote cave in Jaintia Hills.
* The fish has no eyes and is white due to a lack of melanin pigmentation.
* As they live in a nutrient-limited environment most of these species are small.

### 8) Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* The State Government of Arunachal Pradesh intends to build a highway through the 862 sq km Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) in East Kameng district.
* The Government had in the past built a highway through the Namdapha National Park.

#### Key Points

* The project is named the East-West Industrial Corridor which is a proposed elevated corridor at the tiger reserve, to be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs.2,550 crore.
* The highway aims to connect Bhairabhunda in West Kameng district and Myanmar in Changlang district along Arunachal Pradesh’s border with Assam.
* The argument over an elevated corridor at the PTR was that it can ensure the free movement of wild animals.
* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state’s foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.
* The vegetation is predominantly tropical semi-evergreen forest.
* What makes PTR special are the brilliant efforts of the Forest Department and local communities like that of the Nyishi Tribe who inhabit the area around the park to protect the wildlife here.

### 9) Amendments in Arms Act, 1959 and Arms Rules, 2016 notified

* Shooting is an important Olympic sport in India. The Indian shooters have excelled in international competitions. Keeping this in mind, the Ministry of Home Affairs, vide its notification issued under the Arms Act 1959, has made provisions to provide adequate firearms and ammunition to the shooters for their practice. The Ministry of Home Affairs vides its notifications dated 12th February 2020 has amended the provisions of the Arms Act, 1959 and the Arms Rules, 2016 to increase the number of firearms that can be kept by the shooters and enhanced the quantity of ammunition fixed for their practice for the year. These provisions shall greatly facilitate their shooting practice.

If a shooter is renowned in one event, he can keep maximum eight (previously it was four), if a shooter is renowned in two events he can keep maximum ten (previously it was seven) and if a shooter is renowned in more than two events, he can keep maximum twelve (previously it was seven) firearms under exempted category. The junior target shooter/ aspiring shooter is now allowed to possess two weapons (previously one) of any category in which the person is a junior target shooter/aspiring shooter. This provision shall facilitate shooters in practicing with various types of firearms. Apart from the above exemptions, the shooters are entitled to possess two firearms as normal citizens under provisions of the Arms Act, 1959.
* Similarly, by amending the provision under Rule 40 of the Arms Rules, 2016 the quantity of ammunition that can be purchased by the shooters during the year for the practice has also been increased considerably. As per the new provisions, for .22 LR rifle/pistol 5000 instead of 1000, for another type of Pistol/Revolver 2000 instead of 600 and for shotgun calibers 5000 instead 500 can be purchased by the shooters.
* Apart from this, the Ministry of Home Affairs has also made other necessary amendments in the Arms Rules, 2016 by amending the Arms Act, 1959, vide the Arms (Amendment) Act, 2019. Through these amendments, it has also been clarified that no license is required for Indian citizens for acquisitions, possession of small arms falling under the category of curio. However, an appropriate license as prescribed would be required for use or to carry or transport such as small arms. Without the endorsement of such firearms in the prescribed license of the owner, no ammunition shall be sold for their use.

He always touts his horns when representing india by elevating it as world largest democracy.

As far as I have gathered:- 

He's not really giving people any financial support. He only urged people to not leave the disadvantaged behind. I understand that. But dude, even people who will be paying them will have no income stream left. 

So what maybe you pay your employees. Will your landlord be generous enough to forget your monthly payments. Maybe he is, but now even he has to pay property tax without any income stream.

He's not providing tax cuts or financing salaries of people. 

Now when this shit storm is all over he doesn't even have any policies if place if he decides a full lockdown. Many business will become bankrupt. Many company will be dissolved. It will be a period of unstable financial turmoil. Many life's will be ruined and that fucker will still not be accountable for all his action ( like erection of 3000 crore statue ) or rather his inaction. 

This could very well lead to another event like Great Depression. Without support from government many people will be laid off and many will become bankrupt.

Many households and companies find it difficult to cope with the current lockdown situation. As important as it is to get work turning out, it is more important to ensure the safety and well-being of all our employees. Fortunately, we at Lohono Stays have managed to tackle the challenge caused by this pandemic. Realising the density of the situation soon enough, we were able to proactively apply the work from home policy.

Applying the work from home policy well in time, helped us safeguard the interests of all our team members. However, this was not the smoothest ride. Considering our operations run in over 4 locations across India and South East Asia, we had to ensure that everybody was secure. We ensured that every staff member or villa member staying at our luxury holiday homes received the bare necessities to get through these quarantined times in perfect health. To enhance the productivity of all our team members, our CEO, Mr. Nibhrant Shah personally suggests good articles to read and encourages all to build on their skillset. Our team members are also encouraged to take up online courses, better yet we are setting up online MasterClasses for them. These will help all team members to learn and grow every day.

Our team is constantly working on improving the sanitation and comfort offered at our villas for rent in Goa, luxury villas in Lonavala, Coonoor villas for rent and private villas for rent in Alibaug. We want to be able to immediately get back into action as soon as things are up and running again. We at Lohono Stays, urge everyone to stay safe and stay at home. This battle can only be won by everyone staying indoors.

Most of the IT companies did start allowing Work from Home (wfh) for a majority of their employees. But some were left out from this under the pretext of essential work for banks such as Wells Fargo. They were forced to work from Office and only after much hue and cry and police raids did they allow the employees to take the desktops home as late as 24th March. This has opened a scope for the spread virus since the virus can still be transmitted amongst employees with out the employee showing any sign.

It has also come to notice that unofficially many employees were threatened of pay cut if they are unable to take the desktops home in spite of 24th Mar lockdown.


The pertinent question arises as to what happens when these employees and their families are found to be infected..? Will they have complete access to health care under company policy? But then, what about their family?

How will they manage their expense if there is mass lay-offs? Given that they are considered too rich to receive ration from govt and too poor to receive grants in the form of bail-outs.

Signs are not encouraging, given that top officials of [corporates](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-03-25/billionaires-want-people-back-to-work-workers-aren-t-so-sure) (including retired) are not providing encouraging statements (though overseas it will have rippling affect in India) & many companies [like this](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/coronavirus-impact-future-groups-kishore-biyani-in-a-difficult-situation-as-lenders-invoke-shares-report-5070601.html/amp) are already finding excuse of pre-existing loans which signals deferment  of salary pay, for many if not all.

	1.	Are NRC and CAA separate?

Yes. 

NRC is not a law, It is a process mandated by  the Indian Citizenship ( Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules 2003.
Source

But are they connected? 

YES.

Since any rules issued from time to time by the government are taken into consideration while interpreting any law. In fact there is a clause in every Act specifying the same, in our case, Section 18 of the Indian Citizenship Act 1955.

Source

	2.	What is the CAA, how can it be misused?

(a) CAA and why it’s unconstitutional

The core idea is to make it easier for  undocumented immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan to get Indian citizenship. The catch is that these immigrants can’t be Muslims.

Are there really ‘persecuted minorities’ that would benefit from this legislation?

Yes, 31,313 individuals to be precise.
This was revealed by the government itself during a hearing by a parliamentary committee on the 2016 version of the Bill. The committee had asked how many people would benefit from the legislation. The Intelligence Bureau replied:


But by specifically excluding Muslims (and Jews), the Bill has raised justified concerns that the Modi government is trying to enshrine religious discrimination into law. 

This when Article 14 of India’s constitution prohibits discrimination on religious basis.

Why does this Act violate Article 14?

Article 14 is Equality of Law.

‘the state shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of laws within the territory of India prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth’

The opposition MPs had pointed this out but Amit Shah insisted the exception to Article 14, “reasonable classification” when making laws. 

In simple words the State can discriminate between citizens on above grounds if special benefits are offered to them for eg; reservations for marginalised communities.

This matter of whether “reasonable classification” is justified is why the Act is being contended in the Courts and will be decided later.

(b) How can CAA be misused?

CAA can be amended only by parliamentary procedures. 

The government has said that the amendment was made to provide remedy to the six communities namely Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan seeking shelter from religious persecution or fear of religious persecution.

However, religious persecution is not cited anywhere in the CAA, 2019. The bare act reads:

""Provided that any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014 and who has been exempted by the Central Government by or under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or from the application of the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 or any rule or order made thereunder, shall not be treated as illegal migrant for the purposes of this Act;"" 



Religious persecution is actually mentioned under the Rules to the amended Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920.



This is very important to understand because the Government can make changes to these rules anytime they want. Rules are basically subordinate laws that the central government can issue through a gazette notification at any time. These laws do not require the approval of the parliament.


*The above point will be important while explaining NRC.

3. What is the NRC?

The National Register of Citizens (NRC) is a registry maintained by the Government of India containing names & certain relevant information for identification of Indian citizens. 

The Nationwide NRC is as a process already underway through the NPR, which is proposed to be implemented in the 2021 census.

(a) What is the NPR?

The NPR is a list of “usual residents of the country”. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, a “usual resident of the country” is one who has been residing in a local area for at least the last six months, or intends to stay in a particular location for the next six months. 

Unlike the NRC, the NPR is not a citizenship enumeration drive, as it would record even a foreigner staying in a locality for more than six months.
 It is mandatory for every “usual resident of India” to register in the NPR.

The NPR will collect both demographic data and biometric data. There are 15 different categories of demographic data, ranging from name and place of birth to education and occupation, that the RGI is supposed to collect in the NPR. 

For biometric data it will depend on Aadhaar, for which it will seek Aadhaar details of the residents. This will allow the Union government, for the first time, to connect their biometric details with information like the birthplace of their parents.

Apart from this, in a test run going on across the country, the RGI is seeking details of mobile number, Aadhaar, PAN card, Driving Licence, Voter ID card and passport (in case the resident is Indian). It is also working to update the Civil Registration System of birth and death certificates.

Even as issues of privacy associated with Aadhaar continue to be debated in the country, the NPR is on a drive to collect detailed data on residents of India. With the recent introduction of Personal Data Protection Bill, in which the Centre exempts its agencies from some or all provisions of the proposed bill there are a lot of red flags being raised about misuse of such data.

Source

(b) How is NPR linked to the NRC?

The legal framework for the National Population Register is grounded in the Citizenship Act, 1955. In 2003, the Act was amended by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led BJP government to introduce the category of an “illegal migrant”. To implement this amendment, a set of rules were issued. 

(The link to the rules is the same as 1. Are CAA and NRC different)

The rules read: “The Central Government shall, for the purpose of National Register of Indian Citizens, cause to carry throughout the country a house-to-house enumeration for collection of specified particulars relating to each family and individual, residing in a local area including the Citizenship status”.

How would these registers of citizens be created? The rules explicitly spell it out: 

“The Local Register of Indian citizens shall contain details of persons after due verification made from the Population Register.”

When the Local Register is generated from the Population Register, a “verification process” would be carried out which would create the category of “doubtful citizenship”. 

The final National Register of Citizens would be prepared by asking doubtful citizens to prove they are Indians as part of a “claims and objections” process.

This Population Register mentioned in the rules is nothing other than the National Population Register.

 In a gazette notification issued on July 31, 2019, the Modi government passed an order to “prepare and update the Population Register” in every state other than Assam.

(c) Arguments against NRC.

	(i).	A botched exercise in Assam

The National Register of Citizens in Assam was updated over the past few years to identify undocumented migrants who had come mostly from Bangladesh after 1971. 

The updated NRC was supposed to document all those people whose names were listed in the NRC of 1951 and were still alive as well as their living descendants who could prove they were permanent residents of the state.

It was a botched exercise. There were many errors during the process.
Source

 In all, around 19 lakh people in Assam were excluded from the final register. 
Source

Soon, the BJP started complaining that many undocumented immigrants had been included in the register, while around five lakh Bengali Hindus were excluded. In fact, even some people who had campaigned for the BJP found themselves excluded.

Source: BJP complaining about a botched NRC
Source: 5 lakh Bengali Hindus excluded in NRC
Source: BJP campaigners find themselves excluded

Anyone who is not able to prove citizenship under NRC is put in detention centres.
Reports of the violation of Human rights in these detention centres is alarming.

Source: A newborn died in a detention centre in Assam. Their mother was later found not to be a foreigner.


	(ii).	Loopholes and inconsistencies in the existing citizenship laws

There is a lot of speculation around cut off dates and proving of ancestry based on the pilot NRC launched in Assam but nothing concrete so far can be determined since the nation wide Bill hasn’t been drafted.

But one thing we know for sure - every person resident in India will be required to prove their citizenship.

How does one prove their citizenship?

This is where matters get complex.

If we don’t consider the speculated ancestry provision which may or may not be included in the nation wide NRC, The current law for citizenship is as follows -


The Citizenship Act defines a citizen as:

Section 3:

Citizenship by birth —

(1) Except as provided in sub-section (2), every person born in India,—
(a) on or after the 26th day of January, 1950, but before the 1st day of July, 1987;

(b) on or after the 1st day of July, 1987, but before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 and either of whose parents is a citizen of India at the time of his birth;

(c) on or after the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003, where—
(i) both of his parents are citizens of India; or
(ii) one of whose parents is a citizen of India and the other is not an illegal migrant at the time of his birth, 

shall be a citizen of India by birth.

Short of this is,

If you were born in India before 1987 but after 1950, you are a citizen.

If you were born after 1987 but before 2003 and either of your parents are Indian citizens, you are a citizen.

If you were born after 2003 and both your parents are Indian citizens or one of your parents is an Indian citizen and the other is not an illegal immigrant, you are a citizen.

So if you were born before 1987, you’re an Indian citizen by birth.

If you’re born after 1987 you have to prove that your parents are Indian citizens. (What about the orphans?)

How do you do it?

If you’re born before 1987, you can prove citizenship by provision of birth certificate or other documents as may be prescribed by the NRC.

Assuming your parents were educated and organised enough they would be able to preserve your birth certificate and other such documents but people from lower middle class or slightly under privileged backgrounds may not have done the same because they weren’t educated and informed enough about the importance of these documents. This leaves a person in a state of handicap.


If you’re born after 1987, considering that  almost 44% of India’s population is under  24 years of age and a total 85% of the population is under 54 years of age, we can safely conclude the above group constitutes a large chunk of India’s population.

You have to prove that at least one of your parents is an Indian citizen. So if you’re born after 1987 naturally your parents are born before 1987. You’ll have to provide the necessary documents of YOUR PARENTS
to prove THEY’RE Indian citizens. Basically they expect you to preserve and possess documents dating back to as much as the 1960’s.

Many news agencies are reporting that mere submitting of passports and Aadhar cards shall suffice and THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE.

Mere submitting of passports, birth certificate shall not suffice to prove citizenship, this was ruled by Bombay high court in 2013.
Source

In conclusion,
67% of our population is still rural as per the 2015 census. This coupled with inadequate infrastructure and lacking admin capacities to implement a nationwide program like this would be a disaster.

	(iii).	Why NRC promotes inequality against the Muslims?

Imagine a scenario where a nationwide NPR is rolled out. The babus administering the exercise mess up and end up sending a whole bunch of people  of all faiths a “specified proforma” from the register. 


Now, a legal recourse is available only to people of the six religions mentioned in the CAA. Do note that the law specifically says that people belonging to these faiths “shall not be treated as illegal migrants"". Muslims, however, will not have any such recourse. For that matter, even Jews won’t be able to do anything about their exclusion from the register. 

As a result, lakhs and crores of excluded people might have to declare that they are illegal immigrants to become Indian citizens again.

The tricky part is proving religious  persecution in another country.

To benefit from the CAA, the person issued a specified proforma by the NPR must prove that, one, they are a non-Muslim migrant from Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh, 

and, two, that they came to India to escape religious persecution. 

*(read with the point mentioned in CAA) But because the Government can make the rules under the Passport Act essentially at whim, the government can simply strike out the second condition and keep only the first.

	(iv).	Economic cost

The Global economy is on a slowdown and India is no exception to it, I generally never attribute GDP numbers with a Government since the only active participation of a Government in a GDP is via public expenditure which is still crucial. However, when a Government actively makes policies which are detrimental to the state of the economy, then fingers will be pointed.

This is the case with NRC.

 In Assam alone it cost 1220 crores - 1500 crores and ended up in a massive failure.
Source:
 
The national cost of implementing the NRC would run into lakhs of crores. With the Indian economy in its current situation, implementing NRC would surely leave a visible dent on the Indian economy. Especially when there is absence of any ROI (Return on Investment) from such a policy.

The estimated cost of this might be close to 2-3 lakh crores (unverified).

Source: This is an opinion piece and the figures may have the effect of being inflated or underestimated.

Say, it costs 3 lakh crores, it’s still just 1.57% of our last year’s GDP i.e. $2.72 Trillion.

However, just like Demonetisation this act will bring the country to a halt. People will have to line up yet again at verification centres, for document verification, follow ups & enquiries. 

In Assam, the NRC updating started on July 30, 2018 and ended on August 31, 2019 and despite taking over an year to complete this process, the entire process ended up in material inconsistencies and glaring errors.
Source:

A nation-wide implementation would cost years in loss of productivity and the economic cost of this practice would be dangerous.

Demonetisation caused the GDP growth to drop to 6.1%, though it recovered in the later quarters and consumption patterns stabilised too.

Over 1.5 million jobs were lost in Q3 of FY 2016-17 post implementation of demonetisation.
Source CMIE report.

The nation wide implementation of NRC will have a similar or larger impact on the economy but this time it will come with a substantial human cost.

	(v).	Cost of Error

The NRC exercise would be highly prone to error—both Type I and Type II. 

Explanation:

Type I errors:  False positives 

Mistakenly identifying a person as an immigrant from protected minority communities such as Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, and erroneously giving them the benefit of Indian citizenship. 

Immigrants are usually a net economic benefit; so the costs of Type I errors are only confined to national security. 

These costs are not nationwide and typically limited to a handful of border districts in India.


Type II errors: False negatives

These occur when those who qualify as Indian citizens are mistakenly categorized as illegal immigrants. A nationwide NRC, if similar to the one in Assam, would imply that false negatives get sent to detention centres or deported.

Type II errors are extremely costly. To minimize false negatives, the bar to qualify as a citizen has to be very simple and easily identifiable. 

Also, infrastructure to scrutinize the paperwork for the NRC has to be exceptionally efficient. 

The Indian state usually fails on both counts. Given the CAB’s current religious exclusionary basis, Muslims are at higher risk of exclusion through false negatives, though all groups, including Hindus, are likely to be affected by errors.


There are three main issues to consider here. 


The first is the trade-off between Type I and Type II errors. 

If, to avoid false positives, the government has a high level of scrutiny for NRC inclusion, all individuals will have the burden of meeting this higher bar. In the process, some might be mistakenly excluded. 

On the other hand, if the bar is set very low to prevent false negatives and erroneous exclusions, then some illegal immigrants may slip through the cracks. 
The current CAB framework, combined with the NRC, is set up to minimize false positives, which will automatically increase false negatives.


The third issue is of the magnitude of error.

1) If Govt executes well with 5% error, 67.5 million people will be displaced (equalling displacement by WW II)

2) If it has Aadhaar error rate (8.8%) 120 million will be left out.

3) If it has 1% error, still 13.5 million Indians will be displaced (same as partition of India)

Both the source materials for the data above are opinion pieces since the numbers can only be estimated as of now and should be read accordingly.

### Tl;dr

Access to good quality internet has never been more important than right now. With most experts unanimous on the need for  social distancing and many workplaces putting into place work from home plans, voice and data connectivity become critical. To ensure that high quality bandwidth is available to all parts of India we have suggested specific steps to be taken by the Department of Telecom. 

### ""We the people..."", of the Internet

Due to the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Union Government is taking various policy measures to safeguard the health and welfare of all Indians as per an advisory by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare titled, “*Advisory on Social Distancing Measure in view of spread of COVID-19 disease*” ([**link**](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/SocialDistancingAdvisorybyMOHFW.pdf)). Point number 3 to this advisory recommends to, “*Encourage private sector organizations/employers to allow employees to work from home wherever feasible.*” A “work from home” measure is critical during this time to contain adverse economic impacts on individuals, companies and the entire Indian economy.

At the same time during this period many people are likely to undergo mental stress and will reach out to loved ones for comfort and support. Even for children, remote educational modes of learning will become vital at this time as schools are closed. Many such interests which require social distancing necessary to restrict the spread of Covid-19 are supported by the availability of telecom and data services. However, as is the case with such a measure we would like to highlight that there comes certain network capacity related risks which policymakers must respond to. 

A recent report in the New York Times, dated March 16, 2020 informs us that a work and learn from home set up, leads to considerable stress on underlying network infrastructure ([**link**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/technology/coronavirus-working-from-home-internet.html)). This is because last mile home service networks are designed to handle traffic patterns which are considerably different to enterprise grade internet broadband networks. Moreover, Wi-Fi based home internet systems have their own set of challenges in terms of reliability and quality of service. 

### We need to have a plan to support each other

We urge for crucial policy measures by putting forth a comprehensive plan in coordination with appropriate government departments and ministries. We specifically suggest the following:

1. **Periodic reviews of telecom infrastructure** **constraints:** There is an urgent need for the DOT and TRAI to conduct assessments in consultation with large telecom and internet service providers on the capacity to carry voice and internet traffic. Separately, there's a need for authorities to engage with representatives from internet users both enterprise facing stakeholders and consumer facing stakeholders in challenges they may face in continuing their day to day activities online. All of these actions must nonetheless, uphold the spirit of net neutrality and not lead to discriminatory treatment of internet traffic.
2. **Encourage voluntary pledges by telecom companies:** We recommend that a voluntary pledge may be encouraged by the Union Government in which telecom and internet service providers decide to not terminate services of any residential or small business users because of their inability to pay their bills due to disruptions caused specifically by COVID-19. 
3. **Ensure full and complete access at all times:** We urge that an advisory may be issued to all State Governments to halt any internet shutdowns or actions under the Telecommunications Suspension Rules, 2017 which are likely to increase hardship for people and organisations. This includes measures which slow down internet access speeds since that has the potential cripple economic activities.

We urge people from across the community (especially technical experts and small businesses) on if they have experienced any difficulties whilst accessing the internet, or using voice and video conferencing services. IFF will remain alert to the situation should it develop.

Policy/Economy,"How I see the Pulwama Attacks, Abridged",14,f3t8ip,ThyDoppelganger,4,"So an year ago, there was some intelligence input that there was a possibility of a terrorist attack. Naturally, they relayed the information over to our honourable Prime Minister the Great Narendra Modi. Now our beautiful Modi was so preoccupied with thinking out policies for the then Budget to boost our economy that he did not pay attention to it. Those stupid intelligence officers should have found a better time to inform our marvellous Modi, like, say, after February 14th.

Anyways, the CRPF men were planning to go to Srinagar from Jammu. Our fantastic Modi told them to take 78 vehicles so that the people would not miss the glory that is the Indian Army. Some fools raised possible security threat in going in a conspicuous 78 vehicle convoy. How dare they?! Shouldn't the people of India, especially those antinationalistic Kashmiris, see the glory of our Hindu nation?

Anyways, while they were moving, a car laden with explosives rammed into one of the vehicles, and the resulting blast killed 40 of our brave CRPF men. This act of terrorism irked our magnificient Modi, who meditated to let their souls rest in peace. During this meditation, Modi got a divine message. ""Those putrid Pakistanis committed this act. We must punish them."" Now this was divine, because even after a year, the NIA still has no clue where the bomb came from, while Modi understood it in a fraction of a second.

Anyways, our divine Modi swore revenge on the damned Pakistanis, and sent our brave Indian Army to Balakot to kill them. Our Indian Army dropped bombs there, killing several Pakistani terrorists. This was a very valiant move. I heard that a soldier was so brave that he gained the Vir Chakra for bravely getting his plane shot down and getting caught.

Anyways, the attack was a success. Exactly 420 terrorists died, including 256 antinational bacteria, 69 anti-Hindu fungi, 42 anti-Indian ferns, 31 anti-democratic trees, 13 Congress lizards, and 9 Muslim Crows. The satellite image in this [Reuters article](https://in.reuters.com/article/uk-india-kashmir-pakistan-airstrike-insi/satellite-images-show-madrasa-buildings-still-standing-at-scene-of-indian-bombing-idINKCN1QN02Z) should show all casualities. If you don't see all of them, including the bacteria, that means you're antinational. Get wrecked by NRC, you filthy Non-Bhakt.

Anyways, the intelligent people of India realised that our excellent Modi should rule India for decades to come. They saw that under our admirable Modi, we can regain the glory of our Vedic age, where there were satellites, where people used the internet, where people had nuke-laden arrows, where divine cows cure cancer, where women were trophies to be placed rightfully in kitchens, where we were proud of our caste system, where Dalits knew their place, where there were no Muslims and hence no terrorists, where kingship was hereditary; wait no, kingship can't be hereditary otherwise we'd be no different from those crazy Congressmen and even crazier Congresswomen, to say nothing of Congress-transgenders. So the Vedic age wasn't perfect, after all. Huh. You learn new things every day.

Anyways, this is my belief of what really happened in Pulwama. Hindustan zindabad.

&nbsp;

PS: /s for those who are incapable of understanding sarcasm. I'm just sad that 40 brave CRPF men died for Modi's selfish ambitions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f3t8ip/how_i_see_the_pulwama_attacks_abridged/
Policy/Economy,Quick Explainer on how to actually read and understand the Budget and Economic Survey,12,ex24ov,Crantankerous,8,"Before the deluge of talking heads and op-eds overwhelm you with their thoughts, here's a rough guide to independently understand 
what the budget and Economic Survey are saying. Source: am research scholar in Economics. 

1. Listen to the whole budget speech or read the transcript online (usually available on a ministry website after a few hours). Dealing directly with the budget speech is the best way not to be swayed by random claims.

2. Filter through the hawa-baazi. A good chunk of the budget speech will be dedicated to singing the government's praises. Ignore all of that; the budget is as much a political speech as it is an economic one.  Do make a note of what they claim to have done though, in order to cross-check later. 

3. Most crucially, listen to how they intend to fund any new schemes. Are they going to increase taxes? Will they just give out loans via PSBs? Do they hope to draw on CSR resources? Will they divert funds from existing schemes?  There are typically two parts to the budget speech: Part A and Part B. Part A is mostly what they intend to do, Part B is mostly about how they intend to raise the funds for it; i.e. the taxation tweaks. Part B in my opinion is more important, as the how of these schemes is as important as the why. 

4. Listen to multiple commentary sources. Big business interests will obviously praise any budget that makes their life easier, and will also obviously praise the government in general to facilitate easy business. Thus: question anything that they say without highlighting specific plus points. The same applies to government critics, professors etc: They (myself included) have biases that lend themselves to automatically assuming the worst of any decision made. 

5. Don't overhype the budget. Between data manipulation and upcoming elections, the budget is no longer the significant economic blueprint that it once was. The same applies to the Economic Survey. It is important, but no longer sufficient to gauge the direction of the economy and the government's economic policies.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ex24ov/quick_explainer_on_how_to_actually_read_and/

Dorsey said “we have policies around violent extremist groups,” but did not give a straightforward answer to the question. Dorsey did not respond to two requests for comment sent via Twitter DM.

>The argument that external experts made to Motherboard aligns with what the Twitter employee aired: Society as a whole uncontroversially and unequivocally demanded that Twitter take action against ISIS in the wake of beheading videos spreading far and wide on the platform. The automated approach that Twitter took to eradicating ISIS was successful: “I haven’t seen a legit ISIS supporter on Twitter who lasts longer than 15 seconds for two-and-a-half years,” Amarnath Amarasingam, an extremism researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, told Motherboard in a phone call.

Twitter's inaction on these accounts makes me more worried. Twitter is excessively used to promote nazi like ideology here in India. Many of these campaigns are paid and Twitter is also a beneficiary of these campaigns.

Policy/Economy,"Anti-national, who me? Anti-""Hindu-Nation""-al, certainly!",62,ee6xey,wricker,28,"**The goal of** ***Hindutva*** **is the religious conversion of India.**

Call me a pessimist, but I believe that the BJP is actually benefiting from the CAA+NRC protests. Call me paranoid, but I think that Modi and Shah will use the chaos in the nation to justify even more fascist measures.

Fascism relies on the dichotomy of ‘us and them’. ‘We’, the caste Hindus, led by a strong patriarch, versus the Muslims (who are really Pakistani infiltrators and/or terrorists; dirty, conniving sub-humans who want to destroy Hindustan) and the Christians (a lot of them Dalits, who ‘belong’ to Hindus but are taking away Hindu college seats and jobs, leading the country to shit, while they should be cleaning our shit).

This is *Hindutva*: hatred and ignorance masquerading as a political philosophy. Not socialism, social democracy, liberalism or conservatism, but hate. These philosophies, whatever their merits or demerits may be, take effort and dedication and love of the subject to study. Hindutva requires only hate. Forget Hindu texts, they don’t even have to study the Constitution. Doing so takes effort, you see. Hating and lynching is far easier.

This is why saffron-toting goons stop Muslims (and in [one unforgettable instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJfvp59Kufs), Kanhaiya Kumar) and force them to chant “Jai Shree Ram”; this is why Amit Shah dehumanizes Bangladeshi migrants to “termites”; why Narendra Modi says the protesters can be recognized from their clothes.

Why abrogation of Article 370, why the blackout and human rights violations in Kashmir, why the abnormal Modia focus on Pakistan, why Ram Mandir, why NRC, why CAA? The message is clear: Muslims are not Indians, and they cannot stay. India is a Hindu Rashtra.

*But what about our Preamble? What happened to ‘sovereign socialist secular democratic republic’? What of Article 14, Article 15? Our Fundamental Rights?*

Okay, maybe we aren’t ‘socialist’ or ‘secular’ anymore. But from a young age we have been reading and hearing these words. “Unity in diversity.” “United we stand, divided we fall.” “India is the world’s largest democracy.” “We are a secular country.” “Indians are known for their hospitality.”

From our youth, the Idea of India is ingrained in us. And Hindutva -- hatred, really -- has attacked the very core of Indian-ness.

The fight today is not because we don’t want persecuted religious minorities to seek haven in India. That’s absurd. We are a very hospitable people.

We fight because 14 percent of Indians face religious persecution in their own country. We fight because the economy is going down and hatred is on the rise, and the ruling party has done nothing to fix either. Instead they are trying to alienate crores of Indians, making detention centres where at least [25 people have already died](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/25-declared-foreigners-died-in-assam-detention-centre-750773.html) (as of 31 Jul ’19), and set the police and armed forces on peaceful protesters leading to the death of at least 20 people (as of 22 Dec ’19). Their fantasy project will cost us [lakhs of crores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlTKGz-TvJk) (to pay for NRC, CAA and detention centres). And if 20 people have died in the 18 initial days of the protests, we may be looking at hundreds, or even thousands of deaths within the next year alone.

If you think what BJP is doing is for the good of the nation, then we disagree on the definition of ‘good’.

And we certainly disagree on the definition of a ‘nation’. Hindu Rashtra and Hindu nationalism violate the Constitution. And turning India into a theocracy like Iran is what Modi and Shah and the Sangh Parivar machinery wants to do. Can Modi say under oath that he does not want to convert India into Hindu Rashtra? Can the bhakts say so?

**Fascism creates the conditions through which it can justify its own fascist policies.**

Religious conversion of India will require imposing tighter restrictions, and more fascist policies. And how does one justify the use of fascist policies?

An enemy.

While the protests have been going on, Indian and Pakistani firing across the border has increased (which was on the rise since the abrogation of 370). On [18 Dec](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/situation-along-loc-can-escalate-any-time-army-chief-bipin-rawat/articleshow/72872824.cms), Bipin Rawat issued a very provocative statement about “escalatory matrix”. On [19 Dec](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/letter-pakistan-india-placing-missiles-kashmir-191219101643065.html), the Pakistani Foreign Minister wrote to UN alleging India had positioned missile-launchers in Kashmir, and the Indian government refused to comment (*a* *great way to defuse tensions /s*). Then Imran Khan on [Dec 21](https://www.dawn.com/news/1523532/pakistan-will-give-befitting-response-if-india-undertakes-false-flag-operation-pm-imran) replied with such terms as “bloodbath” and “false flag operations”. And today ([22 Dec](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pakistan-violates-ceasefire-along-loc-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-rajouri-poonch/article30371876.ece)) morning there were major firing and shelling from both sides on multiple places: Pakistan [reports](https://thesouthern.com/news/world/pakistan-says-indian-shooting-kills-in-kashmir/article_e76017d4-78f9-5481-92c9-1a147f352159.html) three civilians killed with a dozen homes damaged, while India says our soldiers “retaliated effectively”.

Funnily enough, no talk of surgical strikes is floating around. Perhaps this time they do not serve Modi Ji’s purpose. Or perhaps there are no clouds in the sky? In any case, this time the purpose will perhaps be served by sacrificing our soldiers in a direct conflict. Against the Muslim-majority Pakistan.

And oh, the protesters who can be recognized by their clothes? Clearly they are Pakistani infiltrators and terrorists. The protesting students? *Tukde-tukde* gang. The professors, academicians and journalists? Anti-nationals and urban Naxals. International critics? They carry the ""white man's burden"" if they're white, and are inconsequential if they're of any other colour.

Fascism, elected democratically, will destroy democracy. Say your final “good morning” on WhatsApp.

In Nazi Germany, Jews were portrayed as dirty ‘rats’ (well, at least a mammal, not insects) who were lazy, stupid and cunning and stole the hard-working Germans’ jobs (see the contradictions?). In fact, Jews were on average well-educated and held important positions and ran businesses due to their hard work. Then through fascist policies, inch-by-inch, Nazis made the conditions unbearable for Jews, so that they really had to lose their jobs, their homes, had to live in squalor, and some started committing petty crimes to feed themselves. “See!” said the Nazis, “we told you they were cunning criminal rats!”

Thus they justified the Holocaust.

Justifying a holocaust is not that hard. We Indians are living that process of justification right now. Not so long ago, Islamophobia was frowned upon or at least hidden, and “anti-nationals” and “urban Naxals” were merely juvenile name-calling to be shrugged off (not so much for Gauri Lankesh). By creating the conditions, Modi is making these words into serious accusations, which will help him bring into effect more fascist policies, and then the Constitution will be re-written. The *ghar wapsi* of India will be complete.

We can at least make the process of justifying the holocaust hard for him. By calling out fake news, boycotting Modia, boycotting companies which support and finance BJP (you-know-who), and above all, by using non-violent means of protest. Y’know, protesting Indian-style.

**Tl;dr**

IFF has responded to the call for public comments and suggestions by the Joint Committee on the Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill, 2019 and sent across a submission on behalf of the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign. In it we have provided substantive inputs on essential privacy principles and a thematic analysis of major issues with the Bill. We have also appended a public brief containing a high-level clause by clause analysis of the Bill. Additionally, we have appended two issue specific briefs on (a) workplace surveillance and (b) the relationship between the PDP Bill and the National Population Register.   


**Essential First Principles**

As a first step we apprised the Committee that since the right to privacy as recognised by the Supreme Court also includes informational privacy this should be the primary lens through which the eventual law should be framed. In this regard, we also mentioned that the Supreme Court in the right to privacy judgement (*KS Puttaswamy v Union of India*) made the observation that the right to privacy subsists in public spaces as well. In this regard, we highlighted that a lot of users’ experiences online occur in certain corners of the internet which are public/semi-public in nature. Therefore, India’s data protection law must respect that and therefore accord adequate privacy protections in these domains  


In addition, we noted that the Joint Committee could shape India’s data protection law to incorporate the [**seven privacy principles**](https://saveourprivacy.in/principles) of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 which was developed by the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign. These principles are based on the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s decision in KS Puttaswamy v Union of India and global examples like the European Union’s (EU’s) General Data Protection Regulation. The seven privacy principles emphasise that individual rights should be at the center of privacy and data protection and that the government should respect user privacy. They also address the need for the creation of a strong supervisory authority; and for surveillance reform.   


**Major Concerns that should be addressed by the Committee**

Subsequently we have done a thematic analysis of our top substantive concerns with the PDP Bill. This includes but is not limited to themes such as:  


*1.    Inclusion and treatment of social media intermediaries in the Bill*

The Bill requires social media platforms identified as “significant data fiduciaries” to set up infrastructure which allows users in India to voluntarily verify their accounts. This measure hampers online anonymity and thereby the right to privacy. Additionally, it will allow social media entities to access people's government issued identity documents. This can lead to aggregation of demographic information across different social media companies and databases. This creates immense scope for companies to build granular user profiles and commercialise personal and sensitive personal data of individuals. **We therefore ask the Committee to remove this provision from the PDP Bill**.  


*2.*   *Need for a chapter on surveillance reform*

Presently, India does not have sufficient privacy safeguards in place when it comes to surveillance carried out by the government. The frameworks currently in place (under India’s Information Technology Act and the Telegraph Act) are geared towards national security and fail to adequately protect privacy. In particular there is a lack of sufficient institutional or legislative oversight. **Thus, we have proposed that there is a need for a separate chapter on surveillance reform in the Bill along the lines of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018**.  


*3.*   *Exceptions for central government to access non-personal data*

A provision in the PDP Bill (Clause 91) provides a carve-out for the Central Government to access anonymised or non-personal data to frame policies in the interest of its digital economy. Such provisions show that the proposed law is far more interested in treating data as a resource. **We believe that a data protection law should not be used as a legislative backdoor to commodify data**.  


*4.   Issues with proposed structure of the Data Protection Authority (DPA) and the accompanying appellate structure*

* The selection committee consists of secretary-level officials. Two issues that arise here are of: i) accountability (these are neither democratically elected nor judicial members), and ii) diversity (it doesn’t reflect executive, judicial and external expertise). **Thus, we have proposed having an open call for applications and for the selection committee to have be inclusive in terms of representation**.
* We have noted that the Bill **impairs the independence of the DPA** by allowing the Government to frame policies which will be binding on them.
* To ensure quicker and localised decision making, we have proposed having **state and regional DPA benches**.
* We think that as things stand, the Appellate Tribunal would lack transparency. To that end, we have **proposed that it must publish all its decisions**.   


*5.*   *The “reasonable purposes” exemption which allows personal data to be processed without consent for reasonable purposes under Clause 14 of the Bill.*

The exemptions granted under this clause are fairly wide. It classifies publicly available personal data as under the “**reasonable purposes**” category. We think that this is a backdoor towards profiling and allow collation of demographic/individual sentiments on issues. We also think this would allow the government (and other powerful data fiduciaries) to aggregate social networking activities without the need for individual consent. The right to privacy is applicable in public spaces. Therefore, we proposed that this **provision be removed from the reasonable purposes exception since it is an excessive encroachment on people’s privacy in public spaces**.  


In addition to these themes, there are also other major issues with the Bill that we have discussed at length in our submission. The #SaveOurPrivacy collective has also authored briefs and explainers on different areas of the PDP Bill. We are sharing them with the JPC, the public and other relevant stakeholders in the hope that our analysis can inform future outcomes.

Policy/Economy,You. Yes!!! It's You. Do it.,67,ekjgwb,agnjataupayoktavu,6,"It's high time already! It's so bad that a lurker has to post this. Have always been one, so as to never degrade the content quality of the sub. But, assessing the current political situation has made me impromptu promptly write this.
I'm not here to be a keyboard warrior by bashing the fascist leader and gain karma out of it.
Instead, I'll lay down a plan to tackle the current regime. It only deals with their propaganda power since it has time and again proven that propaganda plays a major role in convincing people to support or commit atrocities. This is the pillar that provides support to the oncoming fascism. Let's BREAK them into pieces. 

1) Since, lack of karma has refrained me from writing things in other subs. As a sound citizen, we need you to get our situation to be heard globally (like the HongKong protest). Henceforth, Fella redditors with high karma and eloquent writing skills. Do post articles, videos, engage in group discussions happening in global subs like world news, Politics and many more. Subs that has their presence in the front page.
Use your meme knowledge, post and repost memes to subs like memes, dank meme, meme economy and so on.

2) WhatsApp is the breeding ground for BJP propaganda. Inorder to counter this, we need you to post videos highlighting the hypocrisy of this party. Especially the ones that OFFICIAL PEEING HUMAN uploads. Tweet him asking for an offline download link of his vidoes. Or do download it by illegal means ( anything illegal for greater good is good).
Do not post link to the videos. Mid-life crisis unkills and aunties won't open the link and watch it. Even if they did, not gonna watch more than 5 seconds. They are brainwashed in thinking Modi is the superman that's gonna save their arse from monotonous life. Do not send them to a liberal's den. They identify themselves as Bhakt due to the sheer propaganda and will refute to believe any of it. Hence, remove the doctrine slowly. Administer the truth little by little in their silly heads. Truth is, if they can be brainwashed to an extend that can support this regime without giving any batshit about the trend of the country. They can be rewired to think in the right way as well. Sharing offline videos in WhatsApp groups will definitely make them watch it accidentally atleat once. Since, they are prone to clicking it on their Phone Gallery.  Apparently,most of them don't care to even delete it later.

You will obviously face criticism from your family, friends and acquaintances by sharing the videos in their WhatsApp Group. Calm your nerves down. Do not engage in a rebuttal with them. Keep posting every hour every day. Things will change. People who blindly supported the party's claims will progressively begin to think about it. They may not change their stand an overnight, a week, a month or forever. But will definitely cross think about the situation. And will not start shouting slogans praising this fascist regime.
Do add photos and videos highlighting great leaders,celebrities,experts of any field expressing their opinions. Do quote Golden words said by past leaders and dictators regarding the fascism.
Share pictures of scientific data and statistics highlighting the economic growth, unemployment     trend and so on. 

Might seem like a silly thing to do. But things like these are definitely the ones that pulled them in supporting BJP in the first place.

3) Eloquent writers of this sub. Please Write messages that serves like a WhatsApp forward messages. (You know, like the share with five groups to charge your smartphone to 100%)
Mods, please make an active thread on it. Allow us to copy and share it in the other online medias.
Use your wit and style, to enhance the power of the message. 

DO NOT LABEL an ignorant or a brainwashed mind as a bhakt or sanghi. I trusted Modi by the party's propaganda thinking they did good for the nation. Unlike the mainstream propaganda, I fell prey to the pretentious Quoran who bags the number one place in followers count. He sold lies without telling lies. He never lied about the policy and regulations government made. Instead, he bent and twisted the facts in favour of the party. He sold hopes after every failure of the government's action. He's a prime example of an educated moron. He highlights the fact that an educated mind is not equivalent as an intellect's mind.
Sorry it turned into a rant.
Wanted y'all to know,how a budding mind like mine fell to his black magic. His educational credentials is what makes growing and educated minds fall for such propaganda trap. If I hadn't stumbled upon this platform, I would've remained a Bhakth even now. 

Change starts from your home. Don't involve in a verbal abuse or quarrel with your hardcore right wing conservative family,if they are one. Instead, keep mumbling about the country's situation then and now like a casual talk.
Let their mind process it.
Educate them about history like How Hitler rose to power and how our country is trying to be the 1930's Germany.

Unlike the Nazi's  who had control over the media back then i.e the newspapers and Radio which was and is only one-sided where the true mind couldn't express the truth. Our generation is blessed enough to have countless online presence and mode of communication is much easier and two sided.

Brainwash the minds into thinking right.

Do not outcast them into a different sect. This will only create chaos. Their sadness will be disguised in the form anger. This will make them loathe our ideologies and ultimately send them into the deep pit of what propaganda machines dug.

Rather,listen to their side and make them understand. I don't know how many of the downvoted answers/ comments were genuinely by people who just needed to hear the other side of the story aka the true and filtered one.
If they are hell bent on being a bhakth,just ignore them. 

You know,brain is a fragile thing. It's shaped by the things that it's surround itself with.

4) Post Documentaries, articles, paragraphs from well renowned books about our world history or anything that seems relevant to the current cause

Fellow redditors be ready to smash the upvote buttons in sending them to the front page. 

It's far-off better than highlighting tweets or images that creates only segregation in the society.

Let's walk the path of Ahimsa and Truth.

""In a gentle way, you can shake the world.""
""Whenever you are confronted with an opponent, conquer him with love.""- M.K Gandhiji

""Peace  cannot be built on exclusivism, absolutism, and intolerance. But neither can it be built on vague liberal slogans and pious programs gestated in the smoke of confabulation. There can be no peace on earth without the kind of inner change that brings man back to his 'right mind'.""

Policy/Economy,The problem with BJP supporters,66,ed1ehe,vardhan68,16,"Okay, so this is my first ever post on reddit. I have been a keen observer of Indian politics since the last 6 years. I was a voter who voted for BJP in good faith thinking that they are different from other parties. But since the last few years my view point has completely changed. But this post won't discuss about the actions of BJP that led to the change in my political stance, but this would rather be a post about what is the real problem with the BJP supporters. 

I might be wrong here but here are some of my observations from my personal experience. 

1.) BJP fans simply don't understand that you can simultaneously oppose two political parties. As soon as you start debating them on a certain issue, they will straight away associate you with congress, communists or even with a terrorist. They believe that every one who is against BJP has joined a faction. 

2.) Staunch BJP fans certainly don't realize that a person isn't against the nation if they are against BJP.  They just rebrand you anti national even if you ask logical questions on government policies. These people are forgetting that we have every right to question the government and protest if we don't think something is right. That is what distinguishes us from a country like North Korea or Saudi Arabia. We do not have a king, rather we have a prime minister who is responsible for answering us. 

3.) BJP supporters tend to discredit each and every source which criticizes the government. These people are just not ready to accept the fact that someone who is not affiliated to any political party can criticize the government. If a post or a newspaper article condemns the government, they simply start calling it anti Indian or congress sponsored propaganda. 

4.) BJP supporters also use a tool called Whataboutism. They justify their wrongdoing by referring to the wrongdoing of other parties. For example, okay BJP is corrupt but what about congress it was more corrupt. But they do not understand that this does not change the fact that even BJP is corrupt, and if you are trying to bring positive changes you cannot repeat the same mistakes that your predecessors have made. 

5.) BJP supporters can't accept the fact that a person can do both constructive and destructive work. I agree that BJP has also brought in some positive changes, but that doesn't justify its wrongdoing. You can appreciate and criticize a person at the same time. Just because you have voted for them shouldn't make them immune to your criticism. You chose them to represent you, you have every right to criticize their actions and appreciate any good work. 

6.) Even if they can clearly see that BJP is playing communal politics, they will turn a blind eye to it. They say congress played a dirtier one, again whataboutism at its best. Congress played communal politics, that is the reason you voted against them. But if the new party also starts doing the same how can you support them only on the basis of your vote.  

7.) As soon as a communal card is played like mandir the BJP fans will always deviate from real issues like economy, poverty, economic reforms, business investments. Their first priority will become to resolve that petty issue rather than the real ones. 


So my thoughts on this issue is that in this day and age we are still fighting for the issues that the British wanted us to fight on. Religion, once upon a time it was used to unite people but right now it is only playing a divisive role. We as the modern generation have to stop taking pride in our religion and just not get emotional while voting on the basis of your religion. It does not matter whatever degree you have because if you caste your votes on the basis of just being from a particular religion then the value of getting that education goes to zero. Don't let social media dictate your perspective, do your own research and make your own mindset rather than following the mindset of the crowd.

Policy/Economy,I transcribed the full text of Dr. Manmohan Singh's remarks on economic mismanagement by the current government in India,722,czvagp,firasd,161,"*Transcript of the remarks by India’s former Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, about economic mismanagement under the Modi government. Sept 1 2019.*

The state of the economy today is deeply worrying. The last quarter’s GDP growth rate of 5 percent signals that we are in the midst of a prolonged slowdown. India has the potential to grow at a much faster rate, but all-round mismanagement by the Modi government has resulted in this slowdown.

It is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sector’s growth is tottering at 0.6 percent. This makes it very clear that our economy has not yet recovered from the man-made blunders of demonetisation and a hastily implemented GST. Domestic demand is depressed. And consumption growth is at an 18 month low. Nominal GDP growth is at 15 year low.

There is a gaping hole in tax revenues. Tax buoyancy remains elusive as businessmen, small and big, are hounded, and tax terrorism continues unabated. Investor sentiment are in doldrums. These are not the foundations for economic recovery.

The Modi government’s policies are resulted in massive jobless growth. More than 3.5 lakh Jobs have been lost in the automobile sector alone. There will similarly be large scale job losses in the informal sector, hurting our most vulnerable workers.

Rural India is in terrible shape. Our farmers are not receiving adequate prices and rural incomes have declined. The low inflation rate that the Modi government likes to showcase comes at the cost of our farmers and their income, by inflicting misery on over 50 percent of India’s population.

Institutions are under attack, and their autonomy is being eroded. The resilience of the Reserve Bank will be tested after its record transfer of rupees 1.76 lakh crore to the government, which claims that it does not have a plan on what it will do with this windfall. In addition, the credibility of India’s data has come under question under this government.

Budget announcements and rollbacks have shaken the confidence of international investors. India has not been able to increase the exports to take advantage of opportunities that have arisen in global trade due to geopolitical realignment. Such is the state of economic management under the Modi government.

Our youth, our farmers and our farm workers, entrepreneurs, and the marginalised section deserve better. India cannot afford to continue down this path. Therefore, I urge the Government to put aside vendetta politics and reach out to all sane voices and thinking minds to steer our economy out of this man-made crisis.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/czvagp/i_transcribed_the_full_text_of_dr_manmohan_singhs/
Policy/Economy,Blind boomer analogy in India - We are the real boomers,27,elxn3v,Monsultant,6,"With the ""OK Boomer"" memes becoming popular, I've noticed a lot of Indians blindly picking up American boomer arguments and using it in Indian context. The arguments go something to the tune of - you had the best of times, the best jobs, social security, economic growth and are now becoming an impediment to education subsidies and liberal policies that will benefit the present youth.

In the Indian context, these arguments are only partially true. Firstly, the word boomer refers to baby boomers generation born post WW-II (1946-1964). This was the period where the great health-care became accessible to everyone in developed nations and the child mortality dropped fast. However, the birth-rates remained relatively high (though decreasing) and this led to high number of kids being born. This was the golden period of American growth - women and boomers then joined labor force and there was a great productivity rise in labor. Middle-class grew and moved to sub-urbs and could live that idylic existence with benefits of big cities as well as countryside. Boomers led a positive existence - not just that, because the birth-rates decreased subsequently, boomers also had disproportionate power as a voting block (which was bolstered by the fact that the voting % in boomers is much higher than in subsequent generations too). So, they could bring about and keep laws which were in line with their values but were old-fashioned according to their successors. Moreover, older people living on savings hate increase in inflation that comes with debt-fueled government spendings. So, it was natural for this generation to be debt hawks which also meant opposition to subsidies which led to rise in education debt amongst younger generation.Hence, it is a legitimate cause of angst for politically savvy young people who are forced to live in a society controlled by the oldies who support arcane laws (against abortion for instance) and go against their benefits (education subsidies).

However, India has a completely different demographic profile. Purely, in terms of being the largest generation, we are the boomers of India. We were born around or just before the high growth post-liberalization India, have opportunities (in terms of private sector jobs, access to information) that the older generation did not have (boomers had booming economy whereas their parents had depression and war). Even as a political block, the young people have the biggest electoral power amongst all generations (a power that was partially harnessed by BJP when they won two elections). Moreover, with the dropping birth-rates in India, we would also grow old in an era of depressed population growth where we continue to be the most influential generation - just like the boomers!

However, it is also true that the older generation is more bigoted, religiously/caste-wise minded than us and have a role in morally bankrupt polity in this country. There is some blame that we can certainly lay on the older generation. But, the whole boomer spiel of the west wherein the millennial generation claims that the boomers had a much better life and are now actively spoiling the present and future of current youth is certainly not applicable here. Our parents' generation had a life of scarcity in terms of resources and opportunities. Even if you are not interested in reading history or talking to your parents, just watch movies - heroes or characters who were struggling to find work, were getting rejected because they could not pay bribes were part of every story. Apart from government jobs, any city apart from tier-I had little to no opportunities in the license-raj era. Statistically, there was lower economic growth and more poverty.

To see the claims about the older generation led a great life is ridiculous. However, it is true that the young need to break free of the religious and caste fundamentalism that the older generation were a victim of due to their lack of exposure and programming.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/elxn3v/blind_boomer_analogy_in_india_we_are_the_real/
Policy/Economy,Moderate rightists vs extremist Savarkarites,57,ecr1tb,hsnaras,12,"I'd identify myself as a centrist with a left inclination. I swing both directions on economic and social issues, but am strongly liberal and progressive on civil liberties. If someone labels me leftist, i would say - not entirely true, but sometimes I'm pretty leftist. With being labeled socialist, I would disagree more assertively, citing my strong inclinations towards a healthy mixed economy and market driven solutions to socio-economic problems. But if I was to be labeled Communist or Naxalite, I would vehemently disagree. I'm sure there are some overlaps between these ideologies and mine, but that way I'll have some overlaps with almost all ideologies in the world. So there's a spectrum on the left side of politics, which is well understood widely. Like me, most leftists don't identify with being communist or naxalite.

Now, right of centre politics, which is having a bit of a peak moment globally at the moment, is bound to have similar diversity and differentiation. But this differentiation is not as well understood, perhaps because Indian right has not been as dominant historically as it has been lately, so people haven't caught up yet. In case of the Modi-Shah government, a lot of people voted for them in the 2014 general elections because of the anti-corruption and development narrative they campaigned with, and because of the national security issue which peaked following Pulwama attack and Balakot airstrikes. These people may be supporters of market-driven economic reforms, may want a break from the status quo of structural corruption in the Indian state, may aspire towards a more assertive foreign policy and may desire a more proactive law and order regime. These are issues which many pragmatic liberals and leftists would also support. I, myself support many of this government's foreign, security and environmental policies. Can't say the same for this government's economic policies and civil liberties record. Anyone who doesn't see the plight of the Indian economy is delusional.

Coming back to the topic, most of the BJP voters may not support the RSS agenda or consider Modi an avatar of Vishnu. But nonetheless, in the everyday online discourse, anyone supporting Modi or government's policy is labeled as Modi-cultist (b word) or belonging to RSS (s word). These terms have been misused so much that they have become meaningless. (But at least  they are not as obscene as the terms that the right uses against left) This distinction between moderates and extremists on the right needs to be acknowledged and understood. The extremists on the Indian right subscribe to the Savarkarite ideology of radical majoritarian nationalism, which they try to link with Hinduism, by calling it Hindutva. The extremist Savarkarites are the ones who indulge in conspiracy theories of global islamic takeover, and that 'sab mile hue hain' - students, congress, aap, muslims, bollywood, global media (even Pak and Dawood). They act as if questioning our own government in a democracy is a crime. These Savarkarites are violently anti-Gandhian, so they are ready to justify any means, as long as the ends are as per their ideology. They are ok with democratic institutions being destroyed so that their leader wins,  hundreds dying because of demonetisation, regular Kashmiris suffering because of some extremist elements, innocent students being shot at because of vandalism done by others, and so on.

This extremist faction of the right is the real danger to our nation, and to whom most liberal leftists are strongly opposed. These Savarkarites interpret the BJP manadate to mean that majority of the country supports their extremists views of establishment of Hindu Rashtra, demonization of Muslims and one-party state in India. They forget that 65 % of Indians didn't vote for BJP, and even among the 35% that did,  many don't support their extremist agenda. These spontaneous, peaceful protests by lakhs of students in every single part of the country has proven that these Savarkarites are delusional. India is strongly pluralistic and will vehemently oppose the bigoted agenda that they subscribe to. And these lakhs of protestors are more opposed to violence than these extremist Savarkarites, and are heart-broken when some miscreants turn towards violence. Violent and extremist elements on both sides should be punished by the due process of law. Jai Hind!

P.S: Those who see the world only through one lens will wonder if I'm a muslim. I was born a Hindu, but no longer identify with any religion. I'm a proud Indian though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ecr1tb/moderate_rightists_vs_extremist_savarkarites/

### Tl;dr

IFF has prepared a public brief highlighting the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 on workplace surveillance. Technologies like CCTV cameras, location tracking and device monitoring have made it possible for employers to turn workplaces into a panopticon, and such pervasive surveillance undermines the dignity of labour and the ability of workers to unionise. We encourage you to read the brief and participate in the consultation being held by the Joint Parliamentary Committee to ensure existing power imbalances between workers and employers are not exacerbated by the Bill.

### Your boss shouldn't be Big Boss

Much has been written about the exemptions provided under the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 for governmental surveillance but there is another form of surveillance which the Bill permits that we should all be worried about. Clause 13 of the Bill exempts employers from seeking consent prior to processing personal data of their employees for recruitment and termination of employment, provision of services and benefits, verification of attendance and performance assessment. With advancement in technology, employers now have the ability to continuously monitor the real time activity of their employees through CCTV cameras, location tracking, device monitoring etc. By allowing employers to track bathroom breaks, lunch breaks and meetings of employees, such technologies pose a threat to the dignity of labour and the ability of workers to unionise. 

### Recommendations 

In order to ensure that any workplace surveillance is strictly need based, context specific and minimize intrusion into the personal lives of employees, we recommend that the following changes are made to the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019.

1. The principles of necessity and proportionality should be included under Clause 13, PDP Bill 2019.
2. A mandatory obligation should be imposed on the employer to consult employees and seek their views prior to processing personal data under Clause 13, PDP Bill 2019.
3. The Data Protection Authority should be entrusted with the responsibility of issuing a Code of Practice for workplace surveillance under Clause 50, PDP Bill 2019.
4. The Code of Practice for workplace surveillance issued by the Data Protection Authority should impose a prohibition on monitoring of any unionisation related activity and prescribe penalties for the same.
5. Trade Union affiliation should be categorised as sensitive personal data under Clause 3(36), PDP Bill 2019.

### Read the public brief and engage with the JPC

For more information, we encourge you to read our public brief on the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 on workplace surveillance. The brief highlights the impact of workplace surveillance on the fundamental right to unionise guaranteed by Article 19(1)(c) and the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. It further explains existing provisions relating to workplace surveillance under the Bill and discusses their pros and cons. Following from the earlier discussion, the brief finally recommends five changes to the Bill to ensure that the existing power imbalances between employers and employees are not exacerbated by pervasive workplace surveillance.

We encourage people to share this brief widely in their circles and participate in the consultation being held by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Bill.

Indian PM Modi makes a round trip of the world with impressive slogans and grants to bring much needed money  but little does he know or care at least till now that most of the money that do come to our country is the money that we couldn't collect in the first place. 

While FDI may not be such a bad thing in itself, one still needs to ask what these all FDIs coming to our country consist of and where exactly are they going.

>**If it is flowing out, why and how it is flowing back into India?**

>Answer: Black Money goes out of India for the reason of evasion of tax, however the money which flows out get’s negligible earnings on interest rates hence it flown back into India by various means to make an even bigger earning. **One of the important ways in which Black Money flows back in is the FDI route**.

>**Why would a country like Mauritius, which is primarily dependent on tourism and sugarcane able to contribute to about 40 percent of our FDI inflows?** Black money which flows out, goes into a Mauritian subsidiary of a Indian (any national) company and comes back into the stock market through FDI route. This is what is called as Round-tripping ie the whole conversion of Black Money into capital investments and returns.

comes back into India through a process called ‘round tripping’ ie the money that had left the country
(and generally ends up in a tax haven) is invested back into the country as ‘white’ money. **Research
on FDI inflows into India by KS Chalapati Rao and Biswajit Dhar (2011) noted that almost 70% of
inflows were through tax havens and at best half the total inflows could be considered as genuine
FDI.**

Policy/Economy,Is this the future?,27,edwj5r,LovableDistributor,10," Sumit was adjusting his position in the bus, sweating in the heat. He saw his friend Shweta shift beside him. They were just returning from their official trip from Mumbai, back to Delhi. The bus had picked them up from the airport. 

Sumit was explaining to Shweta about how good the movie was. While he was explaining, he was simultaneously watching the road. He had a view of the road ahead. He spotted two SUVs parked across the road, as if to block it. He saw half a dozen people standing in front of it. His heart skipped a beat.

His body stiffened, and Shweta felt it. 

“What’s wrong?” she asked

“Nothing, just give me a minute” he said

He kept looking around and found a seat beside another girl in the back. He immediately got up.

“You should move there” he said, pointing at the empty seat.

“Okay, you’re just acting weird now. Why should I move?” she asked in a high pitch

“Don’t ask questions, please! Just go there!” he said as he grabbed her hand and almost forcefully lead her to the seat. He only had a moment to look at her face and he felt bad.

“Okay, I’ll explain everything later. Just don’t worry. Sit tight and you’ll be fine” he said

She pulled him back, standing midway between the seat they were sitting in and the seat he had chosen. They felt the bus slow down further, she had to hold on to the rails on the ceiling. 

“I’m not going anywhere until you tell me what’s going on!” she hissed

Sumit looked around, and while some were staring at what was soon appearing to be a mob blocking the road, some were staring at them. Sumit figured he still had some seconds before they got in. He grabbed her hand and took her to the seat they had been sitting in.

“We don’t have time. But this is the issue. I’m circumcised. They look like RSS mobs and they normally check the guys for this. If they see that you’re with me, they’ll assume you are a muslim too. I’ll manage, it’s okay” he whispered to her. 

Shweta took a few moments to register what she just heard, while she saw Sumit’s face turn scarlet. They were good friends, but this was a detail about that she didn’t know if she wanted to hear. 

“Shweta, just go!” he hissed, but at the same time wondering what she was thinking

“No, why should I leave you to fend for yourself? Please, I’ll tell them that you’re with me. That you’re my family. They--”

“No, they are going to check all the men anyway. There’s no point” he interrupted her.

They heard voices, and he forcefully grabbed her hand and took her to the other seat. He ran back to his, and Shweta could see his back was stiff. She was crying but realised that she couldn’t do anything at this point.

She saw two men barge inside the bus with wooden clubs and she could even see knife handles, from the knives tucked into their pants. One man was remarkably tall, with a thick beard and had a saffron towel around his neck. The other man was of average height and clean shaven. 

“If you cooperate, this will be over quickly and you can be on your way. I’m saying it now, don’t create trouble” the smaller of the two men announced.

“All the men come outside!” the tall man roared, so loud that Shweta flinched

She knew what this was going to be. She felt a huge pang of guilt. Her instinct of self-preservation took over. “Nothing could be done” she thought. 

Five minutes later, she counted 18 men come back. They were one short.

She didn’t see Sumit come back. She felt the bus lurch forward and she immediately ran to the driver

“My friend isn’t back yet! Please! Don’t leave already, he must be out there!” she screamed

“He’s not coming back *beta*” he replied calmly

“No no! He will come back!” she screamed at the top of her voice in desperation

She then collapsed to the ground, next to the driver howling.

The year is 2038, in New Delhi, Hindustan. If you’re reading this from the past, you’ll notice that it’s not called India any more. It all started in 2016, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a huge mandate and were lauded for their pro-development policies. 

Before I tell you what happened, let me tell you what else is going on with “Hindustan”. What Sumit and Shweta went through is just one instance. This is happening everywhere. They can’t check women, but they check men if they’re circumcised. If they are, the women they are with are also taken. 

The government is condemning this, albeit very mildly and of course the PM keeps tweeting how sad he is and urges not to engage in violence. The government keeps insisting that they have no hand in this, but it is the work of “miscreants” that they aren’t able to control.

Starting with the protests that erupted in the erstwhile India at the end of 2019, it soon emerged that the BJP after winning their second election with a landslide, were now enacting their core ideologies. 

In Social Media, Narendra Modi always appeared to be a man who treated everyone equally. However, it was in rallies that his actual persona could be seen. Millions watched helplessly as he brainwashed thousands every week. The BJP realised that all they needed was to brainwash the gullible. To tell them that Hinduism was under threat. That our country was going to the Muslims. 

Muslims were accused so many things. The economy bad? They blamed it on them. They accused muslims of impersonating Hindus to get away and practice their religion secretly. This rumour became more widespread when Muslims were left stateless after the National Registry of Citizens was introduced in 2020. 

So many protested, but turns out they weren’t enough. Protests weren’t the only thing required. People needed to un-brainwashed. People needed a good pair of spectacles to see clearly. 

The hard truth was, the number of people who believed in “Hindutva” outnumbered the others and this kept BJP in power. The BJP knew - all they had to do was campaign in rural areas and brainwash the gullible in the communally unstable places in India.

I was wondering if the poeple of this subreddit could share some of their experiences teaching and attending STATE schools in India. Could you also share the issues no matter how small or big with the education policies regarding all education ( including the universities such as JEE-IIT) . So far, we have been to two churches in the UK where we held coffee mornings and sold home made Indian food to raise money for the charity and to spread awareness of the issues. So far we have raised around £150 and gotten the churches to include it in their local newspapers and leaflets. 

If you have provided issues, thank you very much!

I'd also like for potential solutions you believe would have great impacts on educations as a whole in India. These could be solutions you have heard/seen being used in countries similar to India (culture/economic) such as China as they share many educational viewpoints and are both emerging economies.

Policy/Economy,"As an NRI, my personal view on the Serious emigration thread.",77,ddoz4c,ppcontentrobot,87,"Here is the original thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dcquo0/serious_emigration_threat_is_it_helpless_yet/

As a person emigrated to Germany, I want to chip in my personal view as to what it takes to make me come back to India. 

tl:dr; I won't be back as of now! May be in future!

Long version:

u/ozonised has compiled very good list of what issues exists and what can be improved.

Infrastructure: I come from Hyderabad and being a capital city the infrastructure is shit! It took more than 10 years and massive amount to build a metro, and that too it's over the top metro not an underground. The roads are already congested and these fools installed metro pillars in between the roads, congesting it even more. The city sewage is still from the Nizams era and nothing substantial has been done to improve it. Every year in rainy season, roads and buildings are submerged in water.

Ride bike for one hour, take a clean cloth and swipe on your face, a black layer come off. That's the pollution in the city. Auto and public busses emit black gases from exhaust! You are literally breathing that shit day in, day out. Just creating better transportation does not make a place livable. You need to plan for the future and build something sustainable! There is no greenery in the city and becoming concrete jungle! Every year when I visit Hyd, I regret roaming on the streets because of that black smoke.

Please make the city more livable. Yesterday there was news about cutting down trees in Aarey park, mumbai to make way for Metro! We need to progress and build infrastructure considering nature not the other way round. It takes just a strong will to inspect/make every person riding a vehicle to follows correct emission standards.

Healthcare:  
Healthcare is completely different topic. Last year, as a challenge to get an MRI for my Cervical Spondylosis problem, my father asked me to get it done in Osmania Hospital. I visited for 20 days and tried to get an appointment with a Neuro doctor and MRI without paying a bribe, sadly I gave up and got it done in a private hospital.

Have you ever visited the pregnant ward in any govt hospital? If you don't puke, I would congratulate you. Imagine women carrying a child for 9 months and then delivering among other 20 women in a congested room and pathetic conditions. Healthcare is literally on their knees.

- Did you know 2 years back Indian mangoes were banned in germany because they were using chemicals to ripe them! 

You know what can be done? Just a good officer and good inspection to keep premises clean and healthy. Checkout the amsterdam cycling documentaries, the govt responded to the public demand and created more cycling infrastructure, so that people can bikle freely and resulting in massive decline in health problems.

Academics: 
The plight of private schools looting parents came to mainstream due to Delhi govt. Kudos to them for bringing awareness. Private schools are robbing and public schools are getting closed due to lack of funds!! Govt has no money to run schools but they make a 3k crore statue. I saw some days back in UP, a school was serving rice with salt as mid-day meal. Are we in such a fucking pathetic situation that we can not give a curry/dal with rice for our future generations? Don't get me started on quality of education. Why can't govt schools have English subject? Why do they have to teach only in regional language? I saw many govt school students under confident when they start college.

In Germany I can study for free until my PG. I can work under professors and also get paid handsomely if I do research. You know what, as a student I pay just 52€(4000 INR) for one semester/6 months and can take part or play as many times. Open the following link with chrome and translate it. https://hsp-hh.sport.uni-hamburg.de/sportangprogramm.htm. It would be mind boggling to know every student in the city can take part in so many sports. You would be overwhelmed when you see the sport infrastructure this country has! I have never played any sport except cricket and thankfully to Germany I played so many sports you can't even imagine and that too almost free! 

You can also take as many courses you want by paying 110€(8k INR) for 6 months. When you earn more then 2.5k€ every month 110€ for 6 months is nothing! Why would I leave this and come back to nothing, where I can get sick just by breathing that shitty air?

Policies: Check out the startup culture here in Berlin and Munich area. In India, we have so many IIT's and lakhs of students graduating every year. What is stopping the Govt from creating a Startup fund and make policies that encourage the fresh minds to create fresh Ideas? They have a startup fund and I guess it has gone to the wind! 

Me, My elder brother and younger sister all are CS students. We are actually working on our startup that would be headquartered in Germany and branch out in India. Do you know why? because we get better funding here and exposure is fucking awesome! Every city has Startup hacks/meetups/pitches! I don't want to start our startup in the red tape of Indian bureaucracy. To be honest, It's a shame that in a country like India, we are lagging behind in Startup world!

Employment: Better startup policies, better infrastructure, better education directly leads to creating more opportunities! No magic wand. I am in my 20s and working on my company, there are lakhs of people like me, but sadly working that shitty 9-5 job in some big company. Just look around and see the jobs created by Zomato and Swiggy, the cash they brought into market from consumers. Imagine startups like these on a massive scale! It would change the face of our country. Our economy needs to be more open and welcoming!

My brother used to work in East Asia and came back to India and he regrets every day. The daily commute, traffic jams, pollution is literally killing him. As the first comment from u/mrfreeze2000 says, ""There are two types of people who emigrate: better pay/lifestyle, and better work"". I Emigrated because of both. You know Its Illegal to make me work on Sat & Sunday. If an exceptional situation arises that I have to work on Saturday, my company has to get permission from Labour office!

- I get 6 weeks of Paid holidays + public holidays
- I can travel 27 countries. Just pack your bags and hop in your car. Los geht's!
- I get PR after working for 3 years or 2 years with German B1 certificate. No Shitty visa issues like in US of A. 
- I can become German citizen in 6-8 years.
- I can take as many sickness leaves i want. It's my right. I dont do it, just saying.
- If my wife is working and expecting a child, she gets 14(fourteen) months of paid maternity leave. As a father you can also take paternity leave.
- My whole family is covered under my Health insurance covering from fever to cancer. 
- Children go to awesome schools here to learn, they can take music as a subject or any sport and all of this is free.
- If I ever got fired, I get arbeitslosengeld(Job Loss money), for 1.5 years I guess.
- Better infrastructure, better health and Hospitals, better care, better money, better air. 

Lastly, I guess this was written by non-muslim person(sorry to bring in Religion). As a muslim myself, my father urges me not to come back to India ever, given the cancer that has spread in recent years. I have desis saying to my face anti-national or paki here in Germany and least I expect that India. I stopped going to Indian festival gatherings here because I fear some dickhead will ask why I came there and what is my intention. Some years back I could trust my fellow Indians and now I lost that hope. Just for reference check this tweet (https://twitter.com/rohini_sgh/status/1180165971006197765), this is the cancer our country has acquired! You don't know the humiliation we are facing these days. Every damn thing has been turned into whataboutery. The current regime spined the propaganda about minority appeasement? What minority appeasement, muslims situation is worse than SC/ST's and that too without reservation. 

Why would I leave all these and come back to India to suck all that shit? I love my country and think of it now and then, but do I miss it? Nah! Do I miss the culture? absolutely yes! Do I want to come back and live there? Nope. Sorry.

Edit: Thanks u/kash_if for the silver!

Policy/Economy,The Purpose of War (1984) - George Orwell,38,ehjlce,Istradefylline,4,"The primary aim of modern warfare is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. From the moment when the machine first made its appearance it was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery, and therefore to a great extent for human inequality, had disappeared. If the machine were used deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt, illiteracy, and disease could be eliminated within a few generations. And in fact, without being used for any such purpose, but by a sort of automatic process — by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to distribute — the machine did raise the living standards of the average humand being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries. But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the destruction — indeed, in some sense was the destruction — of a hierarchical society. In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to eat, lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed a motor-car or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared. If it once became general, wealth would confer no distinction. It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which wealth, in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in practice such a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance.

To return to the agricultural past, as some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing, was not a practicable solution. It conflicted with the tendency towards mechanization which had become quasi-instinctive throughout almost the whole world, and moreover, any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated, directly or indirectly, by its more advanced rivals. Nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by restricting the output of goods. This happened to a great extent during the final phase of capitalism, roughly between 1920 and 1940. The economy of many countries was allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation, capital equipment was not added to, great blocks of the population were prevented from working and kept half alive by State charity. But this, too, entailed military weakness, and since the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary, it made opposition inevitable. The problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world. Goods must be produced, but they must not be distributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare. The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built.

In principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another. By the standards of the early twentieth century, even a member of the Inner Party lives an austere, laborious kind of life. Nevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large, well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or three servants, his private motor-car or helicopter—set him in a different world from a member of the Outer Party, and the members of the Outer Party have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call ’the proles’. The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty. And at the same time the consciousness of being at war, and therefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste seem the natural, unavoidable condition of survival.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ehjlce/the_purpose_of_war_1984_george_orwell/
Policy/Economy,I read the Indian economic survey of 2018-9 so you didn't have to. Here are the highlights,94,c95ykl,MelodicBerries,46,"The biggest take-away was the direct attack on what the survey calls 'Anglo-Saxon economics'. Basically the concept of a general equilibrium theory. Instead it claims an economy is always within either a 'virtous cycle' or a 'vicious cycle'. 

A virtous cycle is characterised by rising investment, rising exports and rising savings. A vicious cycle is the inverse of that. 

The implication is that the government must intervene to steady the ship and any fantasy about 'rational actors' has to be abandoned.

The importance of higher savings cannot be underestimated accoring to the survey. It is only with high and rising savings that a country can **self-finance** high investments. Otherwise it must seek out foreign savings which gets translated into a high current account deficit which in turn makes it vulnerable during times of crises. 


They survey continually made mention of China and other fast-growing East Asian economies when making its case in countless graphs. It is clear what the chief inspiration is. 

Having very high savings naturally means having a correspondingly low domestic consumption. Thus, the only way to have fast growth when domestic consumption is subdued is through fast export growth. They survey made the case that because India still has a low share of world export market so there is plenty of scope to regain, regardless of trade tensions.

The survey made many other recommendations, of which judicial reform is one which caught my one, but the overriding theme of the survey was the call to abandon 'Anglo-Saxon economics', by which it meant general equilibrium theory. 

It'll be interesting to see if India truly makes a decisive economic policy break from the past as the language suggests.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c95ykl/i_read_the_indian_economic_survey_of_20189_so_you/
Policy/Economy,"Guys, I am disappointed in the way we exploit the poor people of India!",35,e3b9rc,Rocky_since1951,10,"We see poor people everywhere in this country, sometimes right in front of some extremely rich and posh areas, we see beggars trying to get a meal a day in front of the same malls where we throw away half of the expensive mall food we eat. We move to countryside , same case, thousands of small plots of land that barely feed them, government schools that barely educate them, social welfare policies that are worth billions that won't even cover their most basic of the needs, huts built on millions of tiny plots of land that barely counts as a home, billions in medicine that won't even help curing most common ailments. Enormous quantities of ration that isn't even the fraction of what is needed, all of that because they are born in the wrong place, to the wrong families, in the wrong castes etc.,

It just crushes my heart seeing all this injustice being done, the resources that could be utilized properly, i am extremely disheartened watching all this guys, very very disappointed!

Of such Inefficiency in exploitation!! I mean what the hell are we thinking?? Wasting all that food on these poor people when we can use it for our own amusement! Like we could use it to make a sport where we throw it into a river or something, or just put all that on the ground  and dance on it, maximizing enjoyment factor! All that billions of dollars wasted on social welfare and infrastructure for these people, instead the boring shitshow that is where we have to watch these people slowly starve to death, we could use the same to build thunderdomes and arenas where we make them fight for a fist-full of food, but then kill them anyway! Instead of wasting all this electricity and technology  to apparently ""elevate"" these people, you know what we can do? GIANT MACHINES!! Machines that can use these people as fuel like in matrix, we can just hook these people as soon as they are born in to these machines with a very thick chord that connects them to the machine through their ass. We hook these people upside down inside these giant machines and mine cryptocurrencies from their butts!! Think about it, we can use this butt currency to improve our economy, place bets in the death matches etc!! Our country is going to be a 5 trillion dollar economy in a few months, imagine if only the select few of us could enjoy all of that!! We.. We could be like a self sustaining switzerland backed by ass crypto! 

I mean seriously think about this, it is a much more humane way of living for these people over whatever the shit quality of life they have now!!

Just my two cents!! Join me in supporting for a humane and prosperous India, lets get rid of poverty and illiteracy* by locking up the poor!

Policy/Economy,"The true purpose of reservations in India is not economic upliftment, but social inclusion.",133,d6vb4b,conqueror_of_destiny,54," ***For the record, I am a Brahmin (I don't see myself as one. It is merely the word that I use when I fill out any Government form that asks me the question) and I have, in no way, benefited from reservations or affirmative action.***

Reservations in India is a fraught topic and tends to divide people like no other topic does. The vast majority of the upper castes blame reservations for India's inefficient Governance and subsequent lack of opportunities. Many others think it is meant to provide economic upliftment to the so-called depressed classes who have been at the receiving end of the caste pyramid for centuries. Others describe it as a necessary evil that does more good than harm. I take objection to this description of reservation as a ""*necessary evil*"" and as a means of economic upliftment. It is not evil and it is necessary. It does not seek to economically uplift the depressed classes. I will now demonstrate why.

Reservations for the depressed classes (scheduled castes or scheduled tribes and so on and so forth) have been a feature of politics, education and employment opportunities in Independent India. The policy aims to reserve a portion of seats in educational institutions, employment opportunities in Government run organisations and in electoral constituencies for those candidates who are identified to be part of the above mentioned communities. These communities have historically been marginalised and have been downtrodden for millennia. In the case of the Scheduled Tribes (or STs), their predilection to residing in the forests and the remote hinterlands of the Indian sub continent has ensured that they remained outside the purview of mainstream society and thus bereft of the opportunities that are provided by being part of the villages and cities and so on. The tribes of India are for the most part, hunter gatherers living in the remote jungle (such as the Bhils, Gonds and Santhals), or nomadic herders in nature, living with their livestock and migrating from one place to another in search of pasture (such as the Gujjars in some states, though their status as an ST is debatable). Many of these tribes lived only on the margins of human settlements in India and were viewed with hostility and suspicion by most people. The British criminalised many of them by instituting an act called the Criminal Tribes act. Entire communities were criminalised and those who were on the margins of society were further outcast. These communities neither had a say nor were given any kind of justice when their resources (such as forest produce, or land that has historically belonged to them) were extracted (or plundered, if you think that way) by the Government of India in the name of the People of India. Their woman and children have been exploited when they venture out of their remote domains. They have forever been on the margins of society, physically and socially, and have had no voice in the debates of modern India, a country that now counts them as its citizens.

The Scheduled Castes (or SCs) have been treated worse. These communities were classified as social outcasts and were often forced to live outside the village. They weren't allowed to draw water from the same well as the rest of the village, they weren't allowed to visit the temple or take part in the communal activities such as festivals or decision making. They provided an important source of agricultural labour in villages (and still do) and performed menial jobs in the cities that were ritually considered impure or dirty. The agricultural economy would collapse if their labour was not available and sanitation would have been non-existent in the cities without the *Dalits* to clean the toilets and clear the corpses. And yet, they were not part of the conversation when it came to society. They have never had a voice, a say in the decisions that are made when the community gets together and makes a collective decision. They have been exploited physically, economically, and socially by all and sundry. Their status has been little better than slaves. They are an important part of Indian society but have little to no say in the affairs of the country or the state, and yet they are counted as citizens of India.

Why am I telling you so much about how these communities have been excluded over thousands of years? Because reservation is not a policy that primarily seeks to economically uplift communities and give them education and jobs. The purpose of reservation is not economic upliftment but ***social inclusion*** within the mainstream of society, in effect giving them a say in governance and a voice in society. Reservation aims to bring these communities into the social mainstream so that they become part of the conversation and are able to participate fully in society (In politics, in our educational institutions, in employment, in decision making capacities and so on). Without affirmative action policies such as reservation, these communities will forever be marginalised on the outskirts of society. They will be denied a voice and denied opportunities to advance, and denied the right to be treated with dignity as Humans. The harm done to these communities by centuries of prejudice has hardly begun to be redressed by the policies of Independent India. 

It is highly unfortunate that the original purpose of reservation has been warped in such a manner that all and sundry (I am looking at the OBCs and those who advocate reservations for economically weaker sections among the upper castes now) are demanding reservations. Reservation is not about economic opportunity. It is about social justice, and economic opportunity is a by product of social opportunity. Until such a time arrives when these communities are afforded the same social opportunities as the rest of society and are not excluded, reservations are a necessity in India. It is ***not*** a necessary evil. It is ***not*** an evil at all. It is justice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d6vb4b/the_true_purpose_of_reservations_in_india_is_not/
Policy/Economy,[Rant] India’s BRUTAL tax for the rich,226,ch4zwd,billionaireinindia,201,"To be honest, I feel this post applies to those who pay tax (regardless of which slab), I’m just putting stuff from my perspective.

There are no two ways to put it, India’s tax on the super rich is ridiculously high. I belong to that super rich community and while paying taxes is not an issue, the amount certainly is. Money doesn’t come easy and I’ve worked hard for it. Meanwhile the government just gives us a big middle finger and increases the taxes. 

Now tell me why would anyone want to live in a developing country with such high tax rates. Before any of you’ll hark on about patriotism and bullshit like that just think logically for a second. For the amount of tax (42.7%) paid here, you can easily shift to a country with lower tax rates. And with the kind of money people from my income category have I can see a lot of them leaving this country for good. 

The government is not incentivizing individuals to become wealthy. What benefits does being wealthy in India get you? Roads are shit, public infrastructure is lacking, incredibly high taxes for luxury items, the list goes on and on.... 
Instead they want to spend my money on statues, stupid ministries like AYUSH, scams, bailing out public sector companies and stuff like that.

Worse, so much money, which I GAVE as tax is being spent to appease the vote bank. Rich farmers are not taxed because the government is afraid to lose them. The individuals and companies who pay taxes (the 1%) have absolutely no say in policies because the government wants to use the money to appease the other (99%). (The figures are just examples). We are the source of that money. India is taking a turn to the socialist era, when taxes were even more exorbitant and India was a planned economy. I just wish the government would aggressively try to increase the tax base instead of strangling those who pay tax.

EDIT- I am NOT averse to paying high taxes in general. I already elaborated that in my comment below but in India, tax does not give benefits that other countries with similar tax rates give.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ch4zwd/rant_indias_brutal_tax_for_the_rich/

Policy/Economy,Real Talk: India's economic future is screwed and no one can do anything about it,22,e5d76w,mrfreeze2000,8,"I'm starting this based on an assumption: that the only way for lower-middle income countries like India to prosper is through a manufacturing-led, export-oriented economy.

This is the only proven model of prosperity in the 20th and 21st centuries.

This manufacturing can't be just any kind. It has to be low skill, high-volume in order to employ a large number of people. India's current manufacturing pattern is mostly filled with high-skill, low employment products like jewellery, medicine, cars, and software.

It's far easier to train 10,000 people to make iPhone accessories than it is to get them to make cars.

But this kind of high-volume, low skill manufacturing isn't coming to India, regardless of any policy push from the government. 

A few reasons why:

&#x200B;

1. Competitors in SE Asia a) have specialized in certain products (like garments in Bangladesh), b) have fewer roadblocks to investment from the populace (they are autocracies or pseudo-democracies), and c) have a cultural affinity with China (such as Vietnam) which makes it easier for Chinese manufacturers to move shop there.
2. Businesses are built on relationships, not just policy leverage. Policy makers don't get this because very few of them have ever run businesses. By now, American businesses have had decade-long relationships with their Chinese manufacturers. These Chinese manufacturers are now building factories in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. If you were an American business, who would you rather partner with - an unknown entity in India, or the Vietnamese arm of the Chinese manufacturer you know and trust?
3. Supply chains are hard to build and harder to optimize. If you wanted to be a manufacturing power in 2020, you would have had to start work for it in 2015, not 2019. We've lost that moment.
4. India's regional inequality means that the states with cheap labor (Bihar, UP) are also the states where no one wants to invest in because of law and order problems
5. India's democracy means that everything becomes much more challenging for a manufacturer - land acquisition, labor issues, etc. Vietnam, meanwhile, can bulldoze whatever the hell it wants to bulldoze and put up a red carpet for manufacturers.
6. And this might be a biased personal take, but I've felt that Indian manufacturers don't have business competence. I've tried to build products in India as well as China. Our Chinese partners treated us as a small company that might later be a big company, and gave us that respect and priority. Our Indian partner treated us as a small fry and was more keen on getting short-term profit than build a long-term relationship.

I feel that the moment where India could be a manufacturing power is past us. 

Without manufacturing, you'll have a situation where:

&#x200B;

1. The state has to spend more and more on welfare to tackle unemployment among a young population
2. To pay for this welfare, the state will increasingly overreach in tax collection. You're seeing this already where a small section of the population pays nearly all the taxes.
3. The small portion of people who have good jobs will be increasingly resentful of their taxes being spent on welfare. This, coupled with environmental issues, will accelerate brain drain and capital flight.
4. Without the capital and manpower, employment generation will be even slower, forcing the state to squeeze even more. If the welfare dole stops, it knows there is going to be widespread unrest. 
5. All this welfare will tax the state exchequer more and more. We're seeing this already - the government has hit its fiscal deficit target for the year in just 7 months. 
6. One the welfare dole stops, tens of millions of unemployed, angry, poor people will only do what they can do: revolt.

 like more about each side. For example, the left
 believing in the rights of the LGBT community. But
 well, when Congress was in power, I was more on the
 conservative side because Congress really felt like a

 one of them. Congress had some questionable
 policies but the situation the BJP has led our country
 into, I mean It's Outrageous.

 I've never seen Modi  commenting on the Unnao rape victim. I've never  seen him assure the country about the current economic situation. He simply doesn't seem to care. Poor Tulsi, lost some of her followers for meeting Modi. Such is the impression that our beloved PM has on the international stage. I don't know, I don't see these Modi praisers talking about the economy at all. I am a little inclined to the right more than the left but this is just shameful that this guy called Modi has led us into this pit. I've never seen him addressing the nation on the issues at ground level. All he does is spew out patriotic and emotional bullshit. I am patriotic and all but it alarms me that our PM has no say in the mob lynchings. I'm from Hyderabad, I live in a population dominated by Hindu and Muslimcommunity's. There have been minor clashes here and there but there were no riots and no bad blood between the two communities. Hell, I have so many Muslim friends, but growing up with them I've never felt the difference between my Hindu and Muslim friends. 

You see, with all these lynchings and forcing
 of Jai Shree Ram slogans has affected one way or the
 other. Before all this crap, we used to break each
 others balls, make fun of the religions and never got
 anyone offended. Suddenly, I look around now and
 we are still the same mates we were, but we think
 twice before bringing up a religious joke. That's what
the Modi government has given us. Everybody has
 the internet, everyone knows what's happening, this
 has to be addressed. Our country's economy, our

The violence yesterday at JNU - as the police stood by and let it happen- is unbelievably tragic and heartbreaking.

Last 6 months have been really dark days for our democracy. Between the authoritarian decision to scrap Article 370 without any consultation from Kashmiri leaders or population; the rampant Internet shutdowns and Article 144 evocations; CAA/NRC and the police brutality against minorities; and the disastrous state of our economy, I think our Government has crossed a line.

I can no longer give them the benefit of doubt. We all stood by and let an asinine policy like demonetization happen, thinking it was just a misguided Government working for the greater good. We didn't even flinch as administration took no action against increasing communal violence, and recruited criminals and openly communal leaders. But it's not a time to remain apolitical anymore.

At this point, I firmly believe Government has run out of chances. If we continue to support it and do not protest against the blatantly unjust laws, we are looking at irreversible damage to our social fabric. The economy is already in a pretty bad state by nearly every metric except the top 20 companies.

We need to create a repository of ideas, and have the best minds of the country (IAS, professors of national institutes, researchers, economists, students) discuss the ideas and assist the government in prioritizing which policies to implement.

I dream of creating an invite only platform for such people to submit and discuss the ideas and policies. I want our country to move away from discussing politics and religion. I want our narrative to change towards ideas and policies that can help propel this extremely capable nation of 1.3 billion people to a brighter future.

I have attached a mock-up of how I envision the portal to look like. Key features:

* Sign up using Aadhar OTP
* anybody can view the discussion but to vote, comments and engage you need to sign up
* initially invite only for the best minds in our country
* people can submit ideas
* ideas segregated in a manner our central cabinet is segregated
* politics and religion agnostic discussion
* No advertisement

Policy/Economy,[AskIndia] Why do we have so much distrust of Businesses and Markets?,16,di5x69,ohdickens,16,"Was listening to a talk from Kunal Shah (founder of Freecharge and Cred) and found quite a few insights about the attitude of Indians towards generating wealth through businesses.

A few things really stood out. For example -

1. India has a unique MRP system for products found nowhere else in the world. It gives us the illusion that we are charged fairly for our goods but it works very counter-intuitively against the poor.
Because the rich pay almost the same price as the poor. A richer neighbourhood should have richer prices than in a poorer neighbourhood.
The manufacturer has to price the MRP at a rate higher than he would in a competitive market because he needs to make sure he covers his cost or overruns due to dead or destroyed stock.

2. How we, as Indians, value money over time. We would not pay for quality which saves us time but we will gladly buy sub-quality goods if it saves us money.

3. We question and probe profit percentages of each private company but have no clue about the efficiency of government spending and yet we keep clamouring for more taxes.

4. Pre-1991, we were poor and ridden with Socialist policies which championed the poor and the farmers and we went bankrupt. But after 1991, when we allowed foreign money to come in, we saw a substantial rise in the standard of living and goods.
Yet, we are still calling restrictions on foreign capital in e-commerce and retail which is just perplexing.

5. We think the private companies are out to loot the people of India and we think Adani and Ambani are rich because of Modi but it is, in fact, the lack of competition and implementation of endless rules and licenses that allow Adani and Reliance to operate in any field with almost no competition.


I don't get it. Is this an education thing? Have we been taught capitalism incorrectly? The numbers are so clear yet we are still stuck in denial about having government involvement in the economy. So many people flock to capitalist economies from India yet why do we trust the government so much?

6) Possible Deflation : With lack of buffer and policy failure, we will spiral down to deflation and products will get cheaper but people will start losing jobs at hitherto rate.

New minted currency as catalyst to breaking economic cycle and perhaps for even worse 

7) Bottleneck Inflation leading to stagflation : Demand will stay the same or may even increase while infrastructure will be severely lacking and to boost economy, we may see new minted currencies and it will lead to rising prices(inflation) but job loss will still stay the same 

8) Lack of foreign investment : Above should be enough to deter any large FDI flow.

I think it makes Modi a globalist, he's not closed the economy to foreign investment or anything, unlike trump who has actively blocked investment from china and put a whole lot of tariffs on different products.

Policy/Economy,[Rant] Criminalization of CSR is another pain for companies,59,cmndkk,billionaireinindia,29,"This is another sort of rant about a bad policy by the government. Id first like to clear something up. I’m NOT against mandatory  CSR. I personally don’t like the very idea of mandatory CSR but since it’s law, our company fully complies with all CSR requirements. It’s just the way the government is amending it to make non compliance a criminal offense that is problematic. Let me explain: 

When a corporation is profitable, it pays corporate tax. On top of that, it generates jobs and wealth for individuals and provides valuable goods and services. This boosts the economy. When companies do CSR, they are essentially doing social service and there is nothing wrong in that. 

The problem is why the bloody hell does the government want to criminalize it? I know that non compliance is an issue but this just makes it an additional headache for companies. The compliance officer may not have the same view of CSR as companies do and will eventually end up harassing us. Since there is no concrete framework for CSR i.e. what is and what isn’t CSR, it is largely open to interpretation. And if the government puts another bureaucrat they’ll have absolutely no idea on CSR. 

In fact, I don’t even understand why the government is doing this. The last time I checked, CSR compliance is at 91.25%. There are certain policies (such as the tax on the super rich) which is vote bank politics but this effectively starts an ‘inspector raj’ all over again. 

And if companies have left over money for CSR, we have to deposit in an escrow account after 3 years?! We are not criminals. We WILL eventually use that money. The government is literally putting its hand in our pockets! This is a sad state of affairs. We aspire to be a 5 trillion dollar economy. The government wants ‘animal spirit’. And the ease of doing business here is being dragged down.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cmndkk/rant_criminalization_of_csr_is_another_pain_for/

**Manifesto**

&#x200B;

There are problems in the way we govern our country today and the political parties of today are too entrenched in their histories (dynasties, Hindutva, regionalism, casteism, communism, crony capitalism, et cetera) to be able to find the solutions India needs to move forward.

Indian humanist Party (IhP) is a facebook page for finding those solutions. We are not yet a political party and it may be years or even decades before we reach a critical mass. We see IhP as the forerunner of a political party that will one day govern India through humanist principles to build a happy, prosperous, clean, green, united, and safe country.

The principles of humanism include the primacy of fundamental human rights and using evidence-based rationality to make policy decisions.

**This is not an atheist organization.** The word 'humanist' as used above does not refer to 'secular humanism' but to the commitment that any interpretations of religious texts or any other ideologies that lead to the conclusion that violating fundamental human rights is justified will be considered unacceptable.

We believe that people should have freedom of belief and freedom from belief, but that the government and political parties should not be involved in propagating or inhibiting religion. That is a role we believe is best left for individuals and communities. The two principles of humanism that will be applied to all actions of the party are:

1. The primacy of fundamental human rights
2. Using evidence-based rationality and empathy as a foundation for decision making.

**It's time for India to move from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one.**

This is a 50-year project.

The RSS started nearly a century ago, in 1925, as a community of volunteers to create a Hindu rashtra as an alternative to the Congress vision of a secular India. In 1984 the BJP, a Hindutva inspired party, only won two seats, but over the last 35 years, it has replaced the Congress as the dominant force in the country’s politics.

Our goal is to learn from, and replicate the successes that the RSS and the BJP have enjoyed to help India transition from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one, one we believe we feel will more effective in achieving our goals. The goal is to actualize the original vision of the Congress of 1947 to build an inclusive secular progressive modern nation, but to learn from their mistakes, one of them possibly being to focus on group identities rather than treating voters as individuals. We believe that this has led to communal voting blocks, polarization, and the inevitable emergence of a majority-minority narrative that is the unhelpful frame for almost all political conversations today.

**Metrics driven**

We will set, communicate, and measure our progress against tangible measurable goals. They will include our rankings on internationally recognized reports:

1. World Happiness Report (current ranking 122/145)
2. Human development index (current ranking 130/189)
3. GDP per capita (current ranking 120/181 as per the World Bank)
4. Education index (current ranking 112/188)
5. Life expectancy (current ranking 125/183)
6. Corruption perceptions index (current ranking 78/180)
7. Global peace index (current ranking 136/163)
8. Press freedom index (current ranking 140/180)
9. Gini coefficient of inequality (current ranking 99/158 as per the World Bank)
10. Gender equality report (87/144)

We will find ways to ensure that state and local equivalents of these metrics are defined and monitored to measure objective performance of PMs, CMs, down to local officials, and we will find a way to ensure a third-party audit of these numbers gives assurance to the public that we are being transparent and honest about the progress or lack of progress we have made on these fronts. We will never knowingly present factually incorrect data to the public.

**We are agnostic with respect to economic ideology**

Capitalism has created wealth and prosperity for many nations and as a general rule, we would like to move to a more liberalized economy which we believe will improve the quality of the citizens of the country, compared to a more government controlled environment. However unchecked capitalism can create perpetual inequalities in society and have an extremely damaging effect on the environment, pollution levels, and ultimately our health and life expectancy. And therefore we believe that there must be state support for the most vulnerable members of our society and state protection of the environment. We will make case by case decisions therefore based on discussion and debates on the pros of specific economic policies. In all cases, we will use data and expert advice to make decisions that best balance the competing demands of economic growth, reducing poverty and inequality, and protecting the environment.

**We are committed to internal democracy**

As a party, we will have regular elections to determine who will lead the party every 5 years. There will be term limits of 10 years with respect to the leadership. However to change the manifesto itself we would use a 2/3rds majority with 75% quorum of party members.

**National security**

We will work towards peacefully agreeing internationally recognized borders with our neighbors - China, Pakistan, Bangladesh. This could be bilaterally or with the help of external bodies such as the United Nations. The final decision is unlikely to be one that will make everyone happy on both sides of the border, but too many lives have been lost in all countries, and we want to find more productive ways of engaging with our neighbors. We will not cross the border to invade land or to attack people. We will improve our intelligence and defense capabilities in order to make up for the lack of strategic options that this decision would entail. We will not use torture or indefinite imprisonment as an instrument of state policy. We will continue to treat Kashmir as an integral part of India, we don’t believe that plebiscite is politically feasible stance for a party to hold in India, if it wants to get elected. Our goal will be to normalize the situation with respect to safety and economic growth so that the people of Kashmir trust the Indian government enough to voluntarily vote out Section 370 so they can benefit from a greater integration with the rest of India.

**Caste and reservations**

We absolutely stand against caste discrimination and at the same time we do not believe that reservations are a solution to caste discrimination. The vast majority of jobs are in the informal and private sectors where reservations don’t apply. The government only accounts for 3-4% of jobs. But as a result of the controversy on what percentage of jobs/educational places should be reserved an entire brand of politics has emerged that focuses on reservations and this has cemented caste identities into place indefinitely, and perhaps for eternity. This has led to zero-sum caste-based electoral politics that distract from the issues of clean drinking water, jobs, law, and order, etc. And the people who suffer most from this in our opinion are the most vulnerable individuals associated with lower castes.

Over 70 years after independence the Dalits are perhaps among the poorest 200 million people in the world. We believe the solution to the caste problem is world class primary education. When penniless immigrants enter Scandinavian countries, their children get free education of such high quality that within a generation they are able to live lives of dignity and possibility. This along with a stringent focus on ensuring that violence against any individual is promptly acted on will, we believe, be a more sustainable and effective solution to the legacy of the caste system. We also recognize that this is not yet a politically viable solution and that many Dalits will understandably feel that something is being taken away from people of their community on the assumption that caste prejudices will fade away by themselves, of which there is no persuasive evidence.

Our approach would, therefore, be to leave any reservations as they currently exist untouched. We would instead focus our energy on investing in education and law and order, till the trust levels are built up among Dalits, etc. in the viability of this pathway and buying into the proposal that disbanding the reservations system is the way to ending the caste system once and for all.

**Freedom of speech and the standard of discourse**

We believe that freedom of speech is the foundation of healthy democracies. We will work to improve our Press Freedom Index from 140/180. We will never use jail, legal means, and certainly not violence, to curb any individual or body for their criticisms of our work if we get elected. Even if they are making factually incorrect statements or deliberately lying. We will have unscripted unmoderated press conferences with all major newspapers and channels at least once in a month so they can subject our policies and decisions to a full and frank inquiry. We will have no restrictions on freedom of speech with the exception of credible incitement to violence and deliberate lies to defame private individuals and businesses.

Individuals and businesses with net assets of more than Rs 1,000 crores will not be liable to protect themselves from defamation except from other individuals who are also above that threshold. This is to prevent rich individuals and businesses to use expensive lawyers to stifle any criticism of their practices by common people. We believe that they are insulated from the effects of malicious rumors but the benefit of talking about corporate or industrial corruption more openly will be of disproportionate benefit to the society. We will work for the removal of blasphemy laws and laws to do with seditious and anti-national speech. We believe that both gods, if they exist, and the country if it is being run fairly, are strong enough to withstand criticism. We will never brand anybody who disagrees with us an anti-national, we will assume they have a different idea of what is best for the people of the country and we will share our views on the matter.

**Science and business**

We will make a concerted attempt to place ourselves at the forefront of technological advancements in the world and to profit from this through world-class businesses. We want India to be at a place where it can contribute technologically superior products like Apple, Samsung, Nokia, Sony. We want India to be a place where Nobel Prize winners in the Sciences come from. We’re fed up of being a developing nation. We want to be a contributing nation.

Policy/Economy,"Manifesto - of the people, by the people, for the people",8,e70sav,poco_gamer,1,"Every election I see all political parties propose their manifestos - the things they plan to implement. These manifestos are mostly made by the respective parties in consultation with their party heads, which as everyone knows are filthy rich people, and who are most often disillusioned by the pains of the poor and masses. Hence, I do not understand why they fight an election on (false) promises they find suitable to make to us.

Instead, they should ask the common man, what to implement and what not to. But since that is not going to happen IMO, we should instead make a manifesto and ask them to fulfil our needs.

I have prepared a mini-manifesto by myself. I am a middle-middle class guy, so I may not be correct about the needs of some other classes like BPL, Lower-middle class or Upper-middle class. I may have also missed on some points and may have written less on some particular topic, kindly excuse as this is done by a single person only.

I have not written much in detail, specifically about Jobs and Economy as I am yet learning more about these fields. But IMO the points I have already mentioned will help in bettering both somehow.

Also, it may seem to some that I have proposed establishing/purchasing a lot of things, and it may seem like a drain on the economy. But IMO those are some basic necessities for the much-touted Super Power, which itself is a welfare state, to begin with.

One more thing I want to address is that I staunchly believe in HIGHER TAXES for Billionaires and Millionaires. As Bernie Sanders says, ""Billionaires should NOT exist"" when half of the population finds it hard to put two fulfilling meals on the table.

Further commenting on above, I believe all natural resources on earth belong equally to each human, and not only to the ones 'privileged' enough to reap monetary gains out of it. I think no one will disagree that a Billionaire doesn't work more than an employee of his/her company. He/she just happened to make money by making others work for him.

And from the little economics I have read, even these rich people need poor, middle-class people to buy their stuff. If the current trend continues, poor will not be able to afford their products which will eventually end up lowering these billionaires wealth. And all the people advocating for Capitalism, kindly look at the USA. Capitalism has sucked it hollow. Millions do not have homes, they sleep in their cars. They survive on food stamps and pay $2500 to deliver a baby. Student debt is at an all-time high. Rich are getting richer, true but for how long you should ask.

-	In 2014, Modi govt allowed mid-sized polluting industries to operate within five km of eco-sensitive areas like national parks and sanctuaries. Earlier this limit was 10 km. (https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/nda-government-further-eases-environment-clearances-for-projects-45664)

Policy/Economy,Did I do the right thing (for myself) by rejecting an offer from a company? Or have I been a dick?,15,cnxe9o,rejectedanoffer,8,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I have been out of work for the last three months and after a long time I recently got an offer after the usual push/pull formalities of the hiring process. 

My take home salary in my previous company was 1.2 lacs PM with the CTC being 14 lacs annually. What this company offered me was 10 lacs annualy with the gross coming out to be 80k per month. Before the process started, the consultant told me upfront that the company's budget was 10 lacs annually and at the most they would be able to stretch that to 11.5 lacs annually. 

Since I had been out of work for quite some time, I decided to take the plunge anyway and take the pay cut. After having cleared all the rounds, I was sent the offer letter with the salary break up etc a day before the joining the company. 

Now as I went through the clauses, I noticed two clauses that made me a bit hesitant. 

1. That I would have to return them the joining bonus of 50K if I leave the company before one year. I was to receive the joining bonus after having served 3 months in the company. 

2. That the notice period in the company was 60 days (2 months). 

I couldn't agree with these and I called the HR for clarification. Now this was a day BEFORE I was to join the company and around 7PM. 

1. The HR clarified that if I leave within the first 3 months I wouldn't have to pay it. Now who leaves a company after joining a company within three months?

2. The HR said that this is company policy and there was nothing the he/she could do about it. 

With two other interviews lined up, I decided to not join the company. Though I have a 50/50 chance of getting through the other companies, I however decided it was too risky to join this company. Esp. the two month notice period. 

So /r/india, did I do the right thing? Or did I take too much of a chance. It's been in my head for the last week so just thought I would share it, let it out, and hear your thoughts on this one. 

What would you have done? Should I have just taken the job since I was 'at least' going to get a salary and some money? Also, the consultant calling calling me back, hearing things like I shouldn't have rejected the offer in this economy was too much to hear.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cnxe9o/did_i_do_the_right_thing_for_myself_by_rejecting/

Policy/Economy,My take on Decline of Indian GDP Growth rate and current state of Economy.,3,dgsy6w,PristineAmbition,1,"according to the world bank growth of Chinese Economy during most troublesome years of depression were double digit and even skyrocketed as we can see below.

Year : Chinese GR - Indian GR (for comparison)

2005: 11.4% - 9.3%

2006: 12.7% - 9.3%

2007 : 14.7% - 9.8%

2008: 9.7% - 3.9%

2009: 9.4% - 8.5%

2010: 10.6% - 10.3%

as we can see Chinese kept their double digit growth in the worst economic crisis of the 21th century while in today's world India cant even Manage the growth rate of 5%.  so this idea that Indian Economy is tanking because global recession is bull, its result of the disastrous economic policies adopted by the 2014-2018 Government.

at least under UPA government Economy bounced back and achieved even higher growth rate after 2008 but under NDA government our economy growth rate is under sharp decline, instead of capturing this once in century moment when western factories are leaving China in search of more affordable and friendly market, we are doing everything we can to destroy our economy.

imagine what will happen when this recession will become a depression in the future if one of the major bank in either India or Western World collapses as most of economists are predicting, i have a feeling that new generation will get his hardest as there are fewer jobs and more manpower (already) and with this slow growth there will be even fewer jobs available for the college graduates in near future, due to lack of experiences they will be first one to get booted if companies will start cost cutting. these depressed young educated class of people will either become a nationalistic bunch of people(Bhakts) or turn India into complete anarchy with revolution.

edit : our Growth rate is now 5.8% from 6.2% according to moody's.

Policy/Economy,What happened to BSNL?,88,b2flpy,antarikhsha,33,"I think BSNL was sabotaged internally for the profit of private companies.

* BSNL used to be a very good provider of telecom services in the country. I remember it was the first telecom company that came into our small town, it provided very good service for that time, it was relatively cheap and reliable. It was also the first 3g provider in our area.
* But somehow, quality of its services went downhill over the years,nowadays the network goes down in my area very frequently due to some fiber optic cut, or sometimes something gets stolen from the tower premises and nobody seems to care.
* Everybody in my town had at least one BSNL sim which they used, but after the disruptions everyone got frustrated and switched to other providers.
* At the time of 3g allotment, BSNL was forced to take the spectrum in all circles by matching highest bid price in that circle. I don't understand why couldn't the govt give the spectrum for free in the first place. After all it's a govt entity, and everybody must have known it would kill BSNL.
* The government didn't even allocate 4g spectrum to BSNL, it was like the final nail in the coffin.

Edit!

* Many of you are looking at BSNL as a separate non government for profit entity, which i don't, I see it as publicly owned utility which is an absolute must for our modern times, not just for remote or non profitable areas but for every location in the country.
* BSNL wasn't as bad as some may believe, it was definitely not up to the mark like Airtel, but it wasn't as bad for that time, we never had network outage of any kind, and was cheap too. It went from average to worse in the last decade only.
* The argument that free spectrum for BSNL may seem unfair for private companies, i would have accepted that if we had a truly free market economy, we never had one, free market in our country only exists for a very few oligarchs, it is used by the govt at its whim.
* I will give you an example, take the case of India Post, it's a PSU and a very well functioning PSU, should we have charged some license fee for it to operate? We have a perfectly good model how shipping and courier companies work in India, they work just fine alongside IndiaPost. Unlike the IndiaPost's case, telecom spectrum is a limited resource so we need a barrier for the entry, but private companies should have survived that too by limiting the amount of services BSNL can provide.
* Also, BSNL wasn't in any sort of bad shape before the 3g spectrum drama, it wasn't in debt, it had huge reserves, to the tunes of 35000 crore which the govt forcibly took from it as a licence fee. All the policies regarding 3g spectrum allocation wreaked havoc on the telecom industry, BSNL drowned in debt not because of being a PSU but because of incompetent governments and its policies like most other private telecom companies.
* BSNL management didn't live in a vacuum, they perfectly knew 4g was coming and they were not slow or incompetent they were sabotaged internally to act like this.
* It's not just Modi, both the BJP and Congress are complicit

Policy/Economy,Is the Gandhi Family suppressing the Left-Wing of India? (I am a Foreigner),12,bu2q23,Brainiac7777777,12,"Recently, I have wondered whether the Gandhi family has truly hindered many progressive policies in order to uphold the Status Quo. 

We have seen this with Manmohan Singh, in which during UPA 2, Sonia Gandhi indirectly took more control over the party and we saw the downfall of many sectors of Government. Another instance of this is how the Gandhi Family disrespected Narasimha Rao, India's most progressive leader. A man who was able to liberalize the Indian economy and initiate many reforms within the Government. The Gandhi Family did not even allow Rao to have his funeral in Delhi and moved him back to Hyderabad.

Even as we witness AAP, which seems to be a Congress Party without the Gandhi family, it seems to be much more progressive and eager to change than Congress.

So as a non-Indian, I am curious, do you believe the Gandhi family is suppressing the Left of India, as it silences more progressive reforms and legislation, in favor of status quo?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bu2q23/is_the_gandhi_family_suppressing_the_leftwing_of/

We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\*\*.\*\*

&#x200B;

**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses — in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and “delivered” to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :

1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**
2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.
3. **Putting in a process of ""Hands On"" education and not  ""Hands free"" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **""Hands On""** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**

&#x200B;

**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **""PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS"" , "" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**""  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)

&#x200B;

**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via ""Interested people"". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying ""HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE"" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.

**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be ""leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways"" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of ""PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT"". The push for higher fees with minimal ""restraint"" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both ""Sociologically and systematically"".**

A total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

Policy/Economy,Questions for supporters of the current Government in India,60,9xtncw,waahmudijiwaah,67,"I want to ask BJP and Modi supporters some questions.

Did or did not Modi say that all black money is in Swiss Banks? If he did, how much of that black money has come back in 4.5 years?

Did or did not Modi say that high prices of Petrol, Diesel and Gas have a bad effect on economy and that people of Gujarat are suffering because of bad policies and failure of Dr. Manmohan Singh's government? If he did, then how come prices are at an all time high now?

Did or did not Modi say that the falling value of rupee is because of corruption in Delhi? Then how come rupee went to almost 75 to a dollar? Would that also mean that there is still corruption in Delhi?

Did or did not Modi say that MNREGA is a living example of failure of Congress government which is getting ditches dug and filled even after 65 years of independence? If he did, then why did he continue the MNREGA program?

Did or did not Modi say that GST can never be implemented in India? If he did then why did he implement it and that too even on clothes and fabric (which has never been taxed in independent India)?

Did or did not Modi say that FDI will hurt the small retailers and kill the biggest segment that provides jobs? Then why did he allow FDI in retail and 100% FDI in single brand retail?

Did or did not Modi say that he will send Congress leaders and other corrupt people from his own party to jail? If he did, then how many people has he even filed an FIR, forget about sending to jail?

Did or did not Modi say that nobody will use a Bullet Train but we should have it just as a symbol of our technological achievement? If he did then why take a loan of 1,10,000 Crores to build some thing that nobody is going to use anyway?

Did or did not Modi say that he will give One-Rank-One-Pension to retired soldiers? If he did then how come he gave One-Rank-One-Pension-Every-Five-Years to them?

Did or did not Modi say that farmers will get 50% clean profit over and above their costs? Then how come there is budget for procuring just 5% of farmers production at that prices and the farmers are being left at the mercy of private buyers after Government procurement budgets and targets are met?

Did or did not Modi say that if people voted for him then they will be assured 'Good-Days' ahead? If he did, then has anyone seen those 'Good-Days' till now?

There is no reason to elect him or his party again.

On the contrary taking decisions like Demonetization and implementing a faulty GST and now the 59,000 Crore Rafale deal show that his decision making is faulty and damaging for the country.

In the Rafale deal he has committed treason (desh droh) with the country by reducing the number of aircraft from 126 to 36, paying extra price and hurting the PSU HAL at the cost of private entity of Anil Ambani.

It will be India's misfortune if he somehow comes back to power.

So if you are patriotic, throw out the garbage.

You have nothing to fear from anyone, especially the Muslims. In fact they live in mortal fear even though they belong to this country and love it, love it probably more than you do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9xtncw/questions_for_supporters_of_the_current/

UNION BUDGET 2019:-

Summary:  Low impact on personal finance as such.  There are some good noises on NBFC, startup, etc.  More help given to small businesses in GST.  Gold duty hiked to 12.5%.

Edit: Custom duty hike in many electronic items. This can affect your purchase decisions.  Mi phones may become cheaper than OnePlus :-)

Does anyone have a book they can recommend about both the politics and policy in India, from immediately after we gained independence till as close to present time as possible? 

Hopefully I’d like it to cover all about the Congress dominance right through the rise of the BJP in the late 80’s, private economy revolution of the 90’s to the shitshow we are in today. 

And also the major incidents/scams that have happened in our history. Blue Star, 1992, bofors, Gujarat 2002, 2g etc.

Policy/Economy,Modi May Be The Last Hope For The Indian Economy To Achieve Greatness,24,8b4unp,BuildMyRank,24,,https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/modi-may-be-the-last-hope-for-the-indian-economy-to-achieve-greatness/story-XO2HtQRi9XrRPZrGn14vxI.html
Policy/Economy,"'The Husband, The Wife and The Wife Deserter': A Tale Of Triple Talaq.",4,c3okk1,iSalaamU,2,"As the Triple Talaq Bill is on the verge of becoming an actual law, let's take a look at what triple talaq is, what it is not and what really is at the heart of the whole debate. 

Triple Talaq is something that Islam itself traditionally frowns upon. Scholars have warned against it since time immemorial and it's generally strongly disliked. Its sole purpose was to serve as a remedy for the *really* troubled marriages and some historians believe that it was originally granted by the Prophet as a means for the 'women' who were married to the most despicable men so that they'd escape that relationship as soon as possible. But, as often tends to happen with most well-intentioned laws, people managed to find the loopholes and favored the 'letter' of the law over the 'spirit' of the law. And as such, most Muslims would be absolutely okay with the illegalization or nullification of triple talaq, but more on that towards the end.

Speaking of laws and women, Islam is the first religion in history to have given women 'rights': social rights, ownership rights, inheritance rights, marriage rights, the right to initiate divorce, the right to remarry, the right to be a witness and give testimony in matters requiring the same, the right to do business (the Prophet's first wife, Khadijah, was a wealthy merchant herself), the right to fight in battle and many many more. Fourteen HUNDRED years ago. 

But, over time, some Muslims twisted the teachings of Islam to suit their own purpose, misused and downright *violated* the very laws of Islam protecting the sanctity of women's rights.. And, over time, it also became okay for the rest of the world to somehow always find a way to judge the 'entirety' of the Muslim community and religion based on the examples set by these worst of Muslims, who are completely unrepresentative of both Islam and most Muslims. 

Anyway, before I digress, coming back to divorce.. So, more than 1400 years ago, Muslim women were granted the right to initiate divorce through the legal sharia process referred to as *'khula'*. (This when women around the world were either burned at the stake for wanting rights or had to promise to be married to the same man for seven lives or had to throw themselves into the pyre with him when he died.)

This is what the normal, the more 'preferred' mode of talaq (divorce) looks like: It's supposed to be done in three stages, over a period equaling roughly three months, and only after the grounds for it have been firmly established (infidelity, adultery, betrayal, loss of affection, etc). Even this 'normal' form of divorce is only meant to be the 'last resort' when nothing seems to have worked to save the marriage. The first month, provided the grounds for divorce are not major (infidelity and/or adultery) and if there is the slightest hope for reconciliation, both the spouses are encouraged to find common ground and rethink their stance, the second month, once again, is time for reflection and possible reconciliation, and only at the end of the third month, when *all* attempts at reconciliation have clearly failed, is the divorce deemed to be finalized and can the spouses part ways.

Anyway, THAT is the 'normal' approach of going about divorce in Islam. And surprise surprise, THAT is how most Muslims actually go about getting a divorce. Most Muslims, too, generally hate the idea of triple talaq. Remember, it's *supposed* to be an absolute last-resort measure, *if that*. Here's a report based on a survey which found that of all the divorce cases amongst Muslims, a mere '0.3' percent were identified as those performed through triple talaq. Less than 1 percent. 

https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/unimportance-of-triple-talaq-supreme-court-muslim-law-4678304/

Yes, 0.3 percent. THAT is how low the incidence of triple talaq really is. Let me just say it once again so it really sinks in. ZERO POINT THREE percent. 

But, how many of you knew that? Or rather, how many of you were led to believe that 'most' of the divorces among Muslims happen the triple talaq way? Or that it's so prevalent among Muslims that 'millions' of Muslim women are simply abandoned by their husbands within seconds? Or that it's because Islam itself encourages it? Or that it's because women simply have no rights in Islam to begin with? 

Many, if not everyone. 

That brings us now to the second, the hidden yet the more important part of this discussion: the 'politics, propaganda and Islamophobia' aspect of it. 

If you could time-travel to today's India from ten years before, odds are you'd find it barely recognizable. 2019 was supposed to be the year when we were just a year away from the watershed moment we dreamed of that would forever change our nation's destiny. We were going to be a developed, happy, prosperous nation, the vision of APJ Abdul Kalam come to life. 

But, it's safe to say that that dream is much farther from being a reality *today* than it was ten years ago. And however unrealistic or unattainable that dream may have been to begin with, I am sure nobody in their wildest dreams ever imagined an India where a 'terrorist' would be elected to the parliament and become a 'lawmaker' in 2019.

A deeply radicalized, bigoted and easily manipulated religious majority has set the country back by many many years, if not decades. Such is the level of toxic propaganda and such is the intolerance of the truth that nothing and absolutely nothing seems to have the potential to stem the flow of this madness anytime soon. 

And it is in this backdrop that it became possible for a man who abandoned his mother, abandoned his wife decades ago and presided over riots that saw hundreds of women get brutally killed and thousands get raped, to rise to be the 'messiah' for Muslim women and their rights and for everyone else to buy into this whole charade. 

And this allowed everyone to believe that the 'logical' solution to correct the injustice of triple talaq was to 'jail' the man for three years based on a report filed by almost anyone, keep the woman on a measly welfare fund for the same duration, keep her children far away from their father and, thus, eventually, to 'save' the marriage. 

If you still think that the triple talaq bill, in its present manifestation, is anything other than a deeply hateful, vengeful exercise of power through which to punish Muslims for, well, *being* Muslims, you clearly are on the wrong side of history.

Policy/Economy,"Zombie State Owned Enterprises, Vampiric Corporations, and a Fossil Fuel That Refuses to Die: Why India's Reliance on Coal is Bad For India and the World",22,bv3p2i,gnikivar2,1," 

Coal in the United States is a dying industry. Coal mines in West Virginia and Wyoming have long been [closing](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/west-virginia/articles/2018-10-13/large-west-virginia-coal-mine-with-400-workers-closing) their doors, and total coal consumption in 2018 is close to half of what it [was ](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37692)a decade ago. It is likely the coal power plants will struggle to survive without [subsidies](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/06/06/donald-trump-hopes-to-save-americas-failing-coal-fired-power-plants). However, it would be a mistake to assume that coal is a dying industry. Many large countries, including India, Indonesia, and China are rapidly increasing their use of coal. In today's podcast episode, I will be exploring India's coal industry, focusing on the struggles of Coal India, the public sector enterprise that dominates coal mining, to dig up enough coal to meet India's demand, the inability of coal and other extractive industries to bring development to the regions where they are most active, and the implications of India's increasing use of coal on the global environment.

Coal India Limited, a state controlled mining company that [controls ](https://www.coalindia.in/DesktopModules/DocumentList/documents/Annual_Report_&_Accounts_2014-15_Deluxe_version_In_English_03102015.pdf)82% of the coal market, has dominated coal mining in India since its creation in 1971. Coal India has struggled to meet the demands of India's rapidly growing economy because it is expected to provide coal to power plants at costs well below global market levels. Coal India was forced to sell coal at prices 70% below market [averages](https://www.ft.com/content/9233696a-8323-11e1-9f9a-00144feab49a), reducing Coal India profits by half. Similarly, Coal India has long [subsidized ](https://www.brookings.edu/research/indian-railways-and-coal/)passengers on Indian Railways by paying above market rates to transport coal. Coal India is legally obligated to hire all of those its mines displace, and strong unions command wages that consume [half ](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/coal-india-high-wage-bills-cast-a-shadow-on-coal-majors-numbers/articleshow/13617713.cms?from=mdr)it revenues. Moreover, corruption and mismanagement at the highest level have resulted in windfall gains to connected companies of [$33 billion](https://saiindia.gov.in/english/home/our_products/audit_report/government_wise/union_audit/recent_reports/union_performance/2012_2013/Commercial/Report_No_7/Report_No_7.html) . A violent and powerful coal mafia has [emerged ](https://in.reuters.com/article/india-coal-jharkhand-dhanbad-coalindia/special-report-coal-mafia-stokes-indias-power-crisis-idINDEE94D00B20130514)that skims money off of each stage of coal production and distribution, with ""Goon taxes"" rising as [high ](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajes.12208)as 10%. The combination of these factors means that Coal India does not have nearly enough money to invest in mechanization and new technologies. Labor productivity of Indian miners is only 4% of that of those in the US, and only 1 in 10 mines are [mechanized](https://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/what-s-keeping-india-dark). The result are severe shortages in coal that act as a serious break on rapid [development](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/indian-govt-grapples-to-find-causes-of-coal-shortages-2018-11-26).

A problem just as severe as Coal India's inability to produce enough coal for the Indian economy, is the fact that coal and other extractive industries have failed to bring prosperity and development to the regions in which they are concentrated. A vastly disproportionate share of India's coal reserves are located in the states of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha. These states are the home of around 8% of India's population, but [over ](http://www.mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/publication_reports/Energy%20Statistics%202019-finall.pdf)two thirds of India's coal reserves. India's iron ore, bauxite, and copper reserves are all disproportionately located in these [states](http://www.jsmdc.in/web/AvailabilityofMineralsinJharkhand.php). However, these three states are also among the poorest in India, with rates of GDP per capita, and human development metrics such as infant mortality substantially worse than the [national average](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/AnnualPublications.aspx?head=Handbook+of+Statistics+on+Indian+States&fromdate=03%2F02%2F2019&todate=03%2F04%2F2019). Moreover, despite wealth of natural resources, these states have seen substantially lower rates of growth than the national average. These disparities are especially striking that many mines are located in adivasi or indegenous lands. The adivasi populations of the region are consistently at the bottom of these impoverished societies, and see few of the benefits of mining. It has been estimated that mining led development has displaced [lakhs ](http://indr.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/B.-Terminski-Mining-Induced-Displacement-and-Resettlement.pdf)of people. In theory, Coal India is obligated to provide employment to these displaced people, but has only managed to provide jobs for a small [minority](https://books.google.com/books?id=BxDKhOnWwOsC&pg=PA117&lpg=PA117&dq=tribe++employment+%22coal+india%22&source=bl&ots=mKvZZWjGxn&sig=ACfU3U2jNdOszeIC3kEvO_E3Ft7pU3xKtA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwii5fKs-YPiAhUDMawKHcwOC-Y4ChDoATAAegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=tribe%20%20employment%20%22coal%20india%22&f=false), while pollution has impacted the livelihoods of many who . Many adivasi people have turned to the Naxalites, a radical and [violent ](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Maoists-trigger-train-crash-100-die/articleshow/5985997.cms)Maoist terrorist group, out of desperation and many ordinary people have been [caught ](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/bastar-tribals-raise-their-voices-against-naxal-atrocities-118032900569_1.html)in the [crossfire](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/chhattisgarh-activists-up-against-salwa-judum-atrocities-107090601020_1.html). While Naxilte rebellion has lost power over the last 8 years, the underlying roots of the conflict have not been addressed.

India's coal industry has consequences that extend well outside of India. India is forced to rely upon coal imports as Coal India has failed to met [demand](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/adani-expects-india-coal-imports-to-hit-record-1557467616076.html) in India. India imported $25 billion of coal in [2018](https://www.trademap.org/Country_SelProduct_TS.aspx?nvpm=1%7c%7c%7c%7c%7c2701%7c%7c%7c4%7c1%7c1%7c1%7c2%7c1%7c2%7c1%7c1), and is projected to become the largest imported of coal in the world in 2019.helping keep mines in West Virginia and Australia open. More important is the Indian coal industry on global climate change. While India is still taking [part ](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2017/jun/01/donald-trump-paris-climate-agreement-live-news)in the Paris Accords, it has made promises of only modest cuts because coal is so central to its development strategy. To be clear, India is investing massively in solar and wind power. Total installed capacity of wind power has more than [quadrupled ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_by_country)over the last decade in India, and 5.4% of India's electricity comes from solar power, a proportion more than [double ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_by_country)that of the United States. Nevertheless, coal is likely to be king for the foreseeable future. Millions of Indians are [buying ](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-mobility-in-indias-passenger-vehicle-market)their first cars every year, while India produces vast quantities of carbon [intensive ](https://www.devalt.org/newsletter/jan97/of_1.htm)products such as cement and steel. Most importantly, coal consumption is rising rapidly in India. The International Energy Agency projects coal use in India will [increase ](https://www.carbonbrief.org/iea-china-and-india-to-fuel-further-rise-in-global-coal-demand-in-2018)from 563 to 708 million metric tons, with total coal consumption increasing by more than 3% a year. Over the last decade India has grown only more dependent on coal, as the percent of electricity generated from coal increased [from ](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EG.ELC.COAL.ZS?locations=IN)66% to 75% between 2007 and 2015. India [emitted ](https://www.axios.com/china-india-us-pushed-carbon-emissions-to-record-levels-in-2018-1b1e171a-d46a-49b7-bc4a-7250942a1a7d.html)2.6 billion of the worlds total 15.3 billion . While per capita carbon emissions are well below the global average, carbon emissions are increasing at a rate over 6% a year. Reconciling India's need for development and environmental concerns will be vital for fighting global warming.

India's coal industry is highly inefficient, a poor engine for raising standards of living, and dangerous to the planet. Nevertheless, the coal industry remains vital to the future of India's economy. Coal fueled the industrial revolution in 18th century England, the rise of America in the 19th century, and the spectacular growth of China in the 20th. Coal is likely to similarly, for better of for worse, likely to play the same role in the development of the Indian economy in the 21st century.

Policy/Economy,"Suddenly, ‘one nation, one policy’ sentiment is overtaking other models -Interview with YV Reddy, IAS, former RBI Governor and 14th Finance Commission Chairman",6,azoh6g,Avinash_Sharma,3,"You have said in your book that there is a feeling in some quarters that cooperative federalism is being replaced with coercive federalism. What is the basis for this comment?

>Some developments have taken place after the 14th Finance Commission’s (FC) recommendations. Cesses and surcharge have increased significantly, even after GST. The States felt that they were being short-changed by the way the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) were restructured, increasing the share that the State government has to put in and then the way the GST is being administered. The general debate earlier was about the Bihar model competing with the Gujarat model and different States’ models of development competing with each other.

>Now, suddenly the “one nation, one policy” sentiment is overtaking the other models. And the Planning Commission, which was a forum for States, is also not there now.

>Due to this institutional vacuum, Ministries are directly dealing with CSS. So, the spirit of discussion and dialogue is being replaced by diktats by various Ministries. Some say that there is no dialogue, which is untypical of cooperative federalism.

You’ve said that States are now forced to share more from their own resources in CSS. After your own 14th FC recommendations, the impression was that the Centre was devolving more to the States as it went up from 32% to 42%.

>As my co-author G.R. Reddy will explain, the comparison is not between 32% and 42%; what was 39% became 42%, because of the way the computations differed. This increase was more than offset by the other actions on cesses and surcharges and CSS. So there has been virtually no advantage for the States

>G.R. Reddy: The 14th FC considered the entire revenue account. Unlike the previous FCs, it considered even the Plan revenue account. As a result, some of the Plan transfers were subsumed under tax devolution.

>The difference between 14th FC and others is that the former did away with sector specific grants that amount to 4-5% of the total devolution. If you take these two together, the actual devolution would have been 39% earlier and that became 42%. Even this 3% increase is not very visible because it has been more than neutralised by the Centre. The reality is that it has increased the matching contribution of the States in CSS and done away with 6000 model schools started in 2011; half way through, in 2015-16, it took a decision to terminate the entire scheme of model schools.

>The entire burden of running schools and meeting expenditure – both capital and operational expenditure, has now fallen on the States.

>They then restructured 66 CSS into 22 umbrella schemes. So there is no change in the number of CSS schemes. All components have remained the same.

Why didn’t States raise the issue?

>We have done so before the 15Th FC… and communicated to the Centre that what they had done was not correct.

>Immediately after the 14th FC recommendations were accepted, the Hon Prime Minister wrote to us saying ‘now that the States are flush with funds…’, We wrote back saying there is absolutely no increase in the flow of funds to the States, but only a change in the composition of transfers in favour of untied transfers. Now what has happened is there has been a qualitative change in the transfers to States – we are getting more money through untied transfers.

>The total transfers as a percentage of gross revenues to the States from the Centre has remained at the same level – 49%.

Aren’t untied transfers desirable? It frees States to use funds for whatever purpose they deem fit…

>Whatever additional money to have come through untied transfers is now tied up towards meeting the additional commitment.

>In the revised pattern of CSS, you have to put in more money.

>You have made a commitment, you can’t ‘uncommit’. But they have changed the pattern. Whatever untied funds you have got, you put in those schemes.

>For example, in 2014, Telangana’s contribution to the CSS was around ₹2,000 crore. In 2015-16, because of the change in funding patterns, it has gone up to ₹3,500 crore. So there is additional commitment on the part of the States.

>There is further commitment for States, because of termination of some CSS – the model schools scheme is an example. Another is BRGF – backward regions grant fund - for Telangana State, 9 of the then 10 districts were under the BRGF. They substantially reduced allocations under women and child welfare also.

>There is a view that there are just too many CSS – money is not efficiently used

>The other concern with CSS is that the money is too thinly spread across schemes. For example, if you take education or health, States are spending close to 80%. The Centre is supplementing the States up to only 20%, which does not make much difference. That too comes with conditionalities, submission of uses, visits of Central teams, delays in release of funds. As a result of these procedures, we are unable to fully utilise the Centre’s allocations. I don’t think any State has used the funds from Centre entirely.

So the solution is to offer funds and allow States a free hand?

>The Commission under Dr. Reddy recommended the same – that the number of CSS should be restricted to some nationally identified priorities.

>Dr. Y.V. Reddy: Basic issue is that Finance Commission is one mechanism which essentially is meant for sharing of taxes and that is based on a formula. 80-90% of transfers to States has always been on tax devolution. In tax devolution, there are no conditions, how much weight you give for population, which census’ population and other consideration namely as fiscal capacity. The only question there is what weight you give. If you give weight equally for efficiency and equity, they cancel out, in some sense.

You mentioned institutional vacuum. Do you think NITI Aayog has not been able to step up to the plate?

>There were some deficiencies in the way the Planning Commission functioned. There was an impression given to the States that they had to go to the Commission as a supplicant but not for discussion. That was its weakness which had to be corrected. In the correction process, that bad habit was got rid of but there was no new system. There is no forum now. Each Ministry has become an authority unto itself and is able to dictate terms to the States.

Is it deliberate that the Aayog does not have power or did it evolve thus?

>That is a question mark. Whether it was by design or by default, the result is that the individual Ministries are indicating to the States, which means there is no coherent and comprehensive view of the States in the process.

There is a view that some of the terms of reference of the 15th FC may not stand the test of constitutional validity. What’s your view?

>There are 3-4 issues. It is true that it generated unprecedented reaction. Never before for an FC have a number of CMs got together and protested. Also, some scholars questioned the constitutional validity of some Terms of Reference – for example, whether there is need for revenue deficit.

>The constitution provides for it and each FC needs to decide on this. Third, the 15th FC has been asked to review the 14th FC. It is a continuing process. Above all, the Commission has been asked to make recommendations keeping in view some performance indicators and that States should conform to certain policy parameters, which reflected the existing policy of the Centre.

>The way the FC is structured, it is not supposed to be an instrument of the central government’s priorities of the day. So it has been questioned on several grounds.

>Most of the considerations mentioned in the ToR are not necessarily binding on the FC. The Commission can choose to or choose not to take these into account. But it needs courage and vision for the Commission to do so – we are hoping that will be there.

What’s your view on the controversy over the base date of population census in the 15th FC?

>The whole question is whether it is a correct thing or not. It is difficult to defend outdated population as the basis. Because the FC is supposed to take into account the needs of the State for the period. How can 1971 population determine the needs of the State in 2021? It was undertaken on the grounds that States should not be penalised. But what about States that have taken action on family planning after 1971? They don’t get anything. It should be a continuing incentive, right?

>This time, they prescribed 2011 population. That is also not valid. The FC recommendations are from 2020. So you should have estimated population of the States for the period 2020-2025. Ideally, there should be no stipulation of a date for population and should be left to the FC but if at all, one should have the population relevant for the period.

Isn’t GST a good example of cooperative fiscal federalism?

>It is an extraordinary institution and is commendable. It did not come into existence overnight. It started as an informal committee in the Finance Ministry and has evolved. In the implementation, there has been dissatisfaction expressed. The fact that the Centre has a veto increases its influence. But that is part of the game. Concerns may be there in the way it is working. But as an institutional set up, it is extraordinarily good. It is a good example of collaboration and cooperation in an institution between the Union and the States.

Can this be replicated in other areas?

>Exactly. This is on the revenue side. On the expenditure side, fiscal transfers outside the FC, it can be brought under some inter-State council. That was the recommendation of the 14th FC.

>The GST Council may not be replicated but is a good approach to build on. On the expenditure side, it is a different type of collaboration, compared to the revenue side.

Is that a recommendation that the 15th FC can give?

>Yes. The transfers to the States from the Centre can take FC and non-FC routes. The 14th FC gave recommendations on how to structure the non-FC transfers. It’s only in the ambit of advice.

>There are three approaches: virtually abolish the Commission by making a constitutional amendment and say this will be the percentage; the second is to have a continuous FC, a GST Council type of mechanism but the FC gets subsumed in this; the third is to have the FC and a design of new institutional arrangements which will be more technical, more political and more consensus-based, as recommended by the 14th FC.

>All this is provoked partly because of the GST Council which has been positive and partly because of the institutional vacuum — both these are pushing us to find new institutional mechanisms.

Pleasantly surprised at the functioning of the GST Council. It comprises people with varying vote bank compulsions.

>The consensus has been the result of number of years of effort. Consultative process has been going on for the last 10-15 years. States also are convinced that it is a win-win situation, for the sake of tax harmonisation across the country, they felt it was better. And there was also the feeling that GST is a better form of tax, leading to better compliance. It builds up a value chain. Initially, there was some apprehension on part of manufacturing States that they may lose out this being a destination tax. So we have put in place a 2 year statutory mechanism that they will be compensated for a period of 5 years. The states have yielded lot more space than the Centre. For States, VAT constituted about 60% of their old tax revenue. They have conceded 50% of their fiscal space to the Centre, whereas the space conceded by the Centre is only 30%. They still get customs duty, income tax etc. In the working, there is still a trust deficit because the voting pattern is fully loaded in favour of the Centre, which has almost a veto power.

>Then, the way the GST is administered is also raising apprehensions in the minds of the people that they are not being treated fairly by the Centre. Like delays in apportionment of IGST, delays in payment of compensation cess, collecting more compensation cess than required. Best thing to do is to reduce compensation cess correspondingly that they are not doing. So there is surplus compensation cess lying with the Centre to be distributed after 5 years. It is for the Centre to set the record straight and remove this trust deficit.

On the special category status for Andhra Pradesh, what was the stand that you took in the 14th FC?

>Special category status is not under the jurisdiction of any FC. In my book, I have explained the Centre’s version of the relationship between 14th FC recommendation and the special category.

>If you want the simple truth, 14th FC did not make any recommendation on inclusion or exclusion of special category. The issue of according special category status and assurance by the PM was given months before the 14th FC could give recommendations.

>But the government has its own explanation as to why it interprets the recommendations of 14th FC with regard to special category status. I have given that in the book. It is for the reader to decide why and how these are related.

Cess is becoming a monster in the administrative system. With GST we assumed that cess won’t any longer be a part of the system. But with Kerala, we have a disaster cess. Isn’t the purpose of a reform lost with such acts?

>There is a calamity fund and the Centre is expected to come to the assistance of states when such things happen and there is always a burden sharing, you can’t anticipate this. Now the recourse to cess for such things is unusual.

Isnt this a step away from cooperative fiscal federalism? The Council is telling one state that funds needed for rebuilding after a disaster are to be generated from within that State...

>That is why some of them are dissenting calling it coercive federalism. These are ‘innovations’ that some States are uncomfortable with.

You have Kerala at the upper end of the social development scale and Uttarakhand at the lower end; T.N., Gujarat and Maharashtra at the higher end of the economic development index with Odisha and Bihar at the other. How is it possible for any central body, including the FC to reconcile these differences?

>That is exactly the issue with regard to any federation. In any federation there are competing considerations. You have to build trust amongst yourselves so therefore there is no fixed formula. That’s how you operate the system.

>What is needed is for the Centre to be able to bring together the States and treat these inequalities or calamities as a national problem in which both Union and States participate. Problem now is that whenever a State opposes the Centre it is accused of being anti-national. Being anti-union is not anti-national.

>There are 3 levels of debate – State interest, Union interest, national interest. To build a national consensus, the Union and States must be together. If the States get the feeling that the Union has abrogated to itself the sole authority of national interest, the States resent it. That is the essence of the matter.

How much is this because of a strong leader at the top?

>You should go back to Constituent Assembly debates. Dr Ambedkar when introducing the draft constitution, discusses the merits and demerits of parliamentary and presidential form of government and says why parliamentary system is important for India. He says that India is essentially undemocratic and therefore emphasises on continuous accountability. He says continuous accountability is more important than stability. That was the deliberate choice on this type of issue.

In 14th FC, you recommended forest cover as a determinant. In the five years that have lapsed, have you studied how that recommendation has helped India’s environment cause?

>No. But it’s an interesting area where we have to see the impact of the recommendation. But the logic is simple – forest cover. The state govt is contributing to environment at a cost to itself. It cannot use the resource but has to maintain it. So you have to provide for it. The basic principle is externalities. The state is contributing at its own cost – it does not gain anything. It incurs cost to maintain the forest.

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

I even plotted graphs on an excel, but imgur won't allow me to upload excel graphs and I have no idea how to upload these onto Reddit otherwise, ideas welcome. Also how does one make tables on Reddit? Copy pasting from excel again does not work.

**The Data** -

Indicator	        NDA	     UPA I	       UPA II
Agriculture    2.78%	    3.07%	       4.10%
Industry	      5.80%	    9.10%       5.10%
Services	      7.60%	    9.90%	      8.09%

On GDP growth rates, nothing much to choose from though the UPA seems to have done well across all sectors, as to how this wa achieved, I will cover it a little later.

Indicator	NDA	UPA I	UPA II
CAD	3.40%	-13.12%	-56.58%

On CAD, the UPA performance looks horrible, one could attribute increasing oil prices (it touched a peak of $ 100 a barrel) to a certain extent, but it is only a portion of why the CAD went down so horribly.
 
Indicator	        NDA	UPA I	UPA II
Inflation WPI	4.58	5.9	         7.08
Inflation CPI	3.86	6.04	10.18

Inflation seems to have been horribly mismanaged by the UPA, and this is largely due to deficit financing and pumping in huge funds into the rural sector in the form of MNREGA. The MNREGA was in the larger picture actually bad for the intended recipients as it drove up prices over and hurt the economy as a whole.

Indicator	       NDA	UPA I	UPA II
Fiscal Deficit	3.8	30.86	76

Again, how did the UPA achieve the funding of such profligate schemes such as MNREGA or the Food Safety Act or the loan waiver? By deficit financing. It essentially spent more (which govts usually do) more than what it earned. This also has the side effect of fueling inflation.

And now we come to why I believe even these numbers are illusionary,

Absolute Increase in Employment (mn)	NDA	UPA
Agriculture	                                              21.25      -15.71
Manufacturing	                                              11.72	-7.23
Non Manufacturing	                                        9.11	26.14
Services	                                                      18.77	-0.48
Total	                                                       60.85	2.72

The net jobs added by the NDA in 10 years as compared to the UPA in 12 (data for 2013 on was not available)  is not even comparable and this is why I believe the UPA growth was an illusory / jobless growth.

Factor in the 10 million unemployed people hitting our workforce every year and it is imperative that as a nation we find jobs for all of them.

Another factor I would have liked to compare but as data is not available prior to 2008 I will leave it out of scope but just mention it. This is the indicator of Gross Fixed Capital Formation in infrastructure. The NDA as well know focussed a lot on infrastructure, roads and the highway network being chief amongst these. The NDA added more roads in 5 years than 30 years of other governments combined. Without the govt massively investing in actual infrastructure, job creation and economic growth is going to be difficult to manage.

This is not new either (the UPA mismanagement), Indira Gandhi did pretty much the same thing. She created an import fueled bubble of illusory growth that broke very quickly and fueled massive inflation. *Windows of Opportunity: Memoirs of an Economic Adviser by Krishnaswamy* goes into detail into how Indira almost wrecked the national economy by recklessly devaluing the currency and sending inflation soaring to 75% in the late 60's. Indira also established the trend of a socialistic economy (not her father, who piloted a Mixed economy) by ruthlessly nationalising every industry from coal to banking to wheat and imposing draconian restrictions on the private sector. Indira ALSO failed to focus on infrastructure, and during her first regime, cut down on investment in infrastructure.

After Nehru who did very well to guide the Indian economy given his set of challenges, every succeeding Gandhi dynast has been an absolute disaster for the national economy. 

The problem is, the Gandhi / Congress way has now caught on and almost every major party follows the same dead approach of populsim, throwing sops during election time and forgetting about even basic economics.

**Subjective opinion**- In BJP I see a party that is serious about building up infrastructure, that is serious about creating jobs, that while populist, marries this populism with a sense of pragmatism. It is arguably the only party right now that sees merit in manufacturing as being the workhorse of the Indian economy. I see how the BJP method has worked (relative to India of course) in places like Chatisgarh, MP, Gujarat, Goa. Yes, it has failed in Karnataka, yet it has the resilience to learn and apply lessons and not just throw up some dynast scion to continue the same tired old politics.

Sloganeering, empty tokenism and sops all won't work without some hard reforms, and this is something the BJP has an established track record in and this is why I support the BJP.

[AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-70-marginal-tax-rate-isnt-that-radical)

When we were born as a republic and our Constitution was being drafted, one of the tallest leaders of the land could foresee the problem we ail with even today. BR Ambedkar warned us about a divide and that divide was not just of caste but of rich and poor. The recent Oxfam Report on Inequality in India is a testament to that. Somewhere along the line we have failed to bridge that divide.

We have progressed, indubitably but failed to progress collectively. Poverty and hunger still ails the weakest among us. I remember watching one video of Raghav Bahl where he mentioned how India, as a mixed economy have actually got the worst of both worlds. Ours is not a **capitalist economy** and even with Indira's 42nd amendment, it isn't a **socialist economy** either.

I am not a Rahul fanboy, I supported Modi and voted for BJP but I concur with Rahul's tweet when he announces MIG and says 'we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers & sisters suffer the scourge of poverty.'

While all this is happening in India, in the west, USA, the Democrats are making a comeback, they have recently won back the House with their diverse bunch of Reps and are putting a leash on their meglomaniac President. The hotly debated topic and the eyesore for Fox News being? AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate on which she campaigned and won and will probably take it forward.

All these three events are happening at the same time and I do not see why we are not having this debate in India. Our divide is only growing and we cannot collectively grow until we take care of the poor and weakened ones. Here is an interesting statistic!

I do understand when you say that Ambani (or other ultra rich people) have notional wealth because it lies in stocks. This is a very capitalistic thought and factually correct but at the same time, incomplete. Ambani's wealth lies in RIL's stocks but, **STOCKS PAY DIVIDENDS**! Ambani, according to [this report](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/mukesh-ambanis-dividend-income-from-reliance-industries-trumps-his-salary), **made Rs 14,553 crore in dividend through his stake in the company over the last 10 years** and  **Rs 1,804 crore in 2018 alone** and that with **a salary of Rs 15 crore annually**.

A rough calculation on Google's currency converter would tell you that **he can finance like two more $100 million weddings with the payout of 2018 ALONE**! So don't talk to me about the concept of notional wealth and how if he starts liquidate, RIL stocks would crash, a common and idiotic argument.

So yeah, we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers and sisters suffer the scourge of poverty and MIG is sure as hell seems a nice idea (not talking about execution right now) and taxing the ultra rich like AOC says cannot be ruled out in India as well. This is India, we have a probe on Mars while we rank 103 of 119 countries in Global Hunger Index, the divide is real.

I am writing down all this because there **needs to be a debate** on this in India as well. The tax plan may just as well be a way to finance UBI or MIG in India but let's talk policy and make a buzz about this.

Lastly, here's a nice tweet from AOC on her idea of income inequality which I absolutely love. [Somewhere between “teachers shouldn’t have to sell their own blood to make rent” & “billionaires with helipads and full-time workers on food stamps shouldn’t exist in the same society”](https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1085293594603339776?lang=en)",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/alx3kj/with_the_recent_oxfam_india_inequality_report/

Policy/Economy,The identity crisis of Middle India,138,63dbev,conqueror_of_destiny,185,"It is often said of India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, that he was the last Englishman to rule India. The saying carries some element of truth to it. Nehru may have been born in Allahabad, but his heart lay in the Shires and Oxbridge. This showed through in his language, cultural sensibilities, and overall, the parliamentary democracy that he guided us towards. He was a towering intellect, but unlike his contemporaries who were by and large bilingual intellectuals, his writings were mainly in English. He could give a speech in Hindi, but his knowledge of the tongue ended there. His sensibilities were English and it is to his credit that being so English and upper class as he was, he could mingle with just about anyone from the classes or the masses in a country as diverse as India.

One of Nehru’s primary concerns at Independence was the building of a national identity. India, under the British, was a loose confederation of states that recognized the paramountcy of the British and its people subscribed to only a vague sense of ‘Indian-ness’ that was never formally defined. Nor was such a definition even required. The Tamil in the far south was as unconcerned with the Punjabi in the far north, as was the Bengali with the Gujarati. As far as the common man was concerned, they mainly subscribed to more or less the same set of cultural values. There really was no concept of a political union called India. Indeed, the idea of a country called India, was born with independence and the dissolution of the British raj. However, the dissolution of the British Raj also brought with it partition and all its communal horrors. The lack of a common identity between the Hindu and the Muslim tore once harmonious communities apart. Nehru and his contemporaries realized that the fabric that held this nation together was frayed at the edges and would soon tear apart. It was of utmost importance, therefore, to cultivate a common identity of Indian-ness, and suppress any alternate cultural or regional identity.

We have all been part of this identity formation, whether it took the form of singing the national anthem every morning at school, or by learning the names of various and far flung rivers of the nation. And by and large, we have succeeded. A Tamilian today cheers for “Enga thalai Dhoni”, a man from Ranchi, Jharkhand with as much fervor as the Punjabi, the Bengali or the Gujarati. A common identity has been built and there is little talk of separatism in the Indian heartland. What separatism exists has literally been pushed to the fringes of the nation and is on the verge of fizzling out itself. The political unification of India has been a success.

Culturally though, we remain as diverse as ever, and a unified identity is something that is neither attainable nor desirable. In many areas of India, language remains a prickly subject and it is quite common to hear diatribes against linguistic minorities and those who do not speak the language native to the area they stay in. However, even this problem of communication has been resolved by that great gift of Empire, the English language. If two people from any of the country’s opposite extremes were to converse, they would use the English language to great effect. Indeed, this has even resulted in an amalgamated language called ‘Inglish’ which has created a cultural identity and linguistic space of its own.

Socially too, we are as diverse and it must be said, as divided as ever. Perhaps more so in the present than at any time in the past, near or ancient. India has always had a divided society. The caste system effectively divides us into haves and have-nots, where the have-nots outnumber the haves by a large sum. The have-nots, by virtue of their numbers are at the bottom of the pyramid, and the haves are right on top. This caste based division of society is often reflected in the economic sphere as well. The upper castes are in most cases, very well off. The lower castes tend to be among the poorer and more downtrodden sections of the society. Consequently the aspirations of the haves are vastly different from the aspirations of those at the lower half of the pyramid. This social pyramid has been the template for every society since the beginning of time. The upper classes, the middle classes and the lower classes are at various times dominant separately, but their composition remains pretty much the same. When the aspirations of one of these classes are not met, a society will experience upheaval. In the case of the lower classes, it is revolution. For the others, this upheaval takes the form of a flight to greener pastures. It is this upheaval that India is facing today.

The Indian state in the past sixty years has done a decent, though by no means complete, job of providing for the basic (and here I must stress on the word basic) aspirations of the lower rungs of the pyramid. The Roti, Kapada aur Makaan has been taken care of for many Indians. Food security was achieved quite a while ago, while our housing situation too has not been too bad. Again, I must remind the reader that there is much to be done, but there has been a good deal of coverage in this area. In the case of the better off citizen of this nation, the Roti, Kapada aur Makaan has always been taken care of. It is something else that he aspires too. These aspirations may take the form of entertainment, social standing, a certain lifestyle or even the choice of clothing. It is a matter of debate as to whether these aspirations have been fulfilled or not. Certainly, the cities of India hold all the ingredients to provide for these aspirations. And yet, it is seen that they do not and the urban youth have flocked to greener pastures abroad like migratory wildebeest. The logical conclusion in this case is that the aspirations of the urban youth have changed and these aspirations are something that Indian society cannot fulfill.

And so what are the aspirations of the urban, educated, elite of this nation? Certainly education and employment is readily available. Admission into an IIT/NIT, or barring that, an educational institute of similar standing is within their reach. A degree in Engineering guarantees every one of them gainful employment with a salary that can ensure a comfortable lifestyle. Some of them go in for a post graduate degree or diploma in management or business administration. A resume containing all this can lead to a very comfortable lifestyle with excellent prospects for any young Indian with an eye on his future. And yet, it is not sufficient to ensure that he or she does not take flight to greener pastures? What then, are the greener pastures that they aspire to?

Everyone has heard of the brain drain of the 70’s and 80’s. Educated Indians fled abroad in huge numbers, stymied by the lack of opportunities in this land. It was a great loss yes, but one could understand why they left. India in those days was in a socialist paroxysm. The license-quota-permit Raj that Nehru set up stifled creativity and business enterprise. Jobs were hard to come by in an economy with a ‘Hindu-rate-of-growth’ and as a result doctors, engineers and scientists fled this country for the US, helping to build societies there. Today however, the nation is better poised to provide employment and opportunities to its engineers and doctors. And yet, they continue to leave in droves. What then, are the opportunities that they are looking for?

Nehru tried hard to build a common identity for this nation. Today, nearly fifty years after his death, it is hard to say if he has succeeded or not. There is a political and cultural union called India. There is also a growing population of youth that hardly even identifies itself with this nation and its people and culture anymore. They identify themselves with the West. And it is in search of this identity, that they surge westwards in increasing numbers every year.

When I asked why they wished to leave this nation, I received many replies.. Some are insightful, some well thought out, and some are purely cynical and selfish, though unbeknownst to the person concerned.

One worshipper of the Western way of rational thought spoke in raptures about their technological and industrial prowess and glowingly described their plans to build a magnetically levitated high speed rail system. He noted that his own nation that had fed, housed and educated him for twenty five years was a “backward shithole that did not invent anything of note”, thus conveniently discarding the fact that it took the United States a hundred years to reach where it is now, while India is still suffering from its birth pangs.

A young lady of my acquaintance described India as a selfish, repressed society of bullies who could not be counted upon to elect a capable Prime Minister. She was “sick of the way we use age old methods that cannot be integrated into modern society, Must it be taught to even respect equally?”. She was right, to an extent. But it is doubtful if she would ever find a society that respects equally, where bullying is not tolerated and is not parochial and narrow minded in some sense. It also took all of my self control to keep from reminding her that Donald Trump has been elected to the most powerful office in the world.

The real reason, one that they are loathe to acknowledge, is that they no longer identify with the people around them anymore. Indeed, the vast majority of Indians are invisible to them and when they do make an appearance in their lives, they are disgusted and feel alienated. They would rather not acknowledge the presence of those whose aspirations are to merely survive, than to sit in a bar the whole day and drink beer and discuss the latest happenings in International politics. Fed on a relentless diet of Americana, they do not identify with Indian events, Indian characters, Indian food, drink or even other Indians anymore. The television shows they watch are American. The food that they eat is American. The books they read are American. The language they are most comfortable with is American. The news channels they are most familiar with show local American news. Indeed, they would know more about the political system of the USA than of their own nation.  The latest agendas of the latest Senatorial candidates would be on their fingertips. What would not be on their minds, is the names of their MP’s and MLA’s back home.

One of the most absurd things I have heard of in recent times is the news that a socialist has been elected to the Seattle city council. That a socialist has been elected in the USA itself is absurd enough. But what makes the news even more absurd is the fact that the candidate who campaigned on a socialist platform was an Indian who was raised in India, was educated in India, was in all likelihood a beneficiary of all the post liberalization reforms of the Government of India. Like everyone else in her generation, she would have been the first to demand reforms and the lifting of India’s socialist policies and yet, when she emigrated to the US, rediscovered the socialist in herself, because she could not bear to see the suffering of the American masses under the yoke of capitalism. It reeks of hypocrisy. Would she do the same thing in India? No. In India, the very same candidate would have triumphantly pointed to the benefits of our liberalization and campaigned for a right wing party, merely because the reforms have benefitted her tiny group of elites who reside on the top of the pyramid at the expense of those at the bottom. But of course, they do not even exist for her. Instead, she chose to fight for the American’s Roti, Kapada, aur Makaan, because – “ It is easier to convince 300 million literate people to vote for you, than to convince 1 billion illiterate people, never mind that they are your own people.”. There is a word to describe such people. It is ‘mercenary’. But then, what can you expect of a people who would rather celebrate Halloween to Holi?

It is easier to convince three hundred million literates to vote for you. It is far more difficult for these people to convince the one billion Indians who are their countrymen to vote for them because they do not even speak their language. Indeed, they do not even make an effort to learn their own mothertongue and identify with the rest of their society. This laziness to push themselves and achieve something points to a deeper malaise in our psyche. In other words, this generation of Indians has ‘Aspirations, but no Ambitions’. They feel apart from the world around them and would rather run away to the West than do anything about the very society that gave birth to them, but cannot satisfy their outsize American aspirations. And why would they not? They are Americans in all but name.

This is a matter of national shame. We are losing on our rights and India's continued potential to lead the knowledge and skills economy which relies on reliable internet access. We have now started reaching out to parliamentarians on this issue. 

This continues our working model of activism where our public engagement is toward institutional outcomes. A short recap. We have through the #KeepUsOnline campaign reached out to 15,000 individual and 80 institutional signatories who petitioned the government to condemn internet shutdowns. We then followed it up with a series of RTI's which demonstrate the legal rules for shutdowns were made secretly, and most recently supported a legal analysis of these rules by one of the domain experts in the area, Nakul Nayak. 

We will continue working against internet shutdowns, meeting people, talking to them about them and ensuring India has a better rank in 2019. Do follow our updates.

**So, what is IFF doing about it?**

Next stop is parliament and we are looking towards our legislators. The dates for the winter session have been announced which commences from December 11. We sensed there was a need to reach out to the offices of various legislators in advance. As subject area experts we are attempting to set up time, talk to their offices and explain this issue to them. Our hope through such knowledge sharing and to enable greater parliamentary engagement on Internet Shutdowns in India. To enable this, two volunteers (Arpitha and Hardik) authored a brief of this issue which is now being sent across along with meetings to put this issue across to several parliamentarians.

Policy/Economy,We really need to talk about Flairs.,108,6bacbg,root_su,133,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/

Brief summary -from the comments

   the gold will provide me with me with less ads,better themes and shit-ton of other features,but the same amount will fill the light in some low rung homes,I am not trying to criticize this good gesture of yours but it would be cool if you find some under-privileged folk and provide them with necessities worth the gold,I can manage with ads and white theme,just my 2cents.

###Scumbag journalist: 

###Writes article saying ""Do the math"". Does no math.

**Faulty Basic Assumptions:**

A look at the JP¥ - IN₹ exchange rate over [the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/NcmqjkW) is fluctuating around ₹0.6 for JP¥1, for the most part. Here's a longer and more detailed view of the [last decade](https://imgur.com/tOxvgAM). While there are spikes and lows, the average seems to be sticking to around 0.6 Rupees per Yen. 

While Japan's Inflation Rate trend graph is certainly quite flat when averaged over the last decade or so, and the average remains near-zero, India's inflation rate has been trending downwards over the past decade, and has [accelerated downwards over the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/SoCXbPi).

The author seems to correlate the difference in inflation with the exchange rate, but the two are not actually linked directly. For instance, India's inflation rates for the years 2009 and 2010 were steep, at 14.97% and 9.47% respectively. During the same years, Japan's inflation rates were -1.67% and -0.40% respectively. The Yen actually *increased* in value, while the Rupee *dropped* in value, within their respective domestic markets. Yet the [exchange rate from January 2009 till January 2011 (the same 2 full years)](https://imgur.com/DHgubGX) remained relatively steady, somewhere between 0.485 - 0.550, on average, a range of about 0.065. One would expect to see a massive increase in the exchange rate, with one yen being able to buy *significantly more rupees*. But that was not the case. So the value of a currency on international markets has little to do with the domestically-perceived inflation in the country.

>Another factor to be considered is that while an interest rate of 0.1% may appear free from an Indian perspective, it is not so in Japan.

Has the author even considered that there are scenarios that are win-win? That economics is not a zero-sum game? This deal should be great for Japan. It can also be good for India. 

###So since the author was a lazy schmuck, here's the actual math:

We are currently getting Japan to invest USD 17 Billion in the project.

Since the author is concerned with exchange rates, that's JP¥ 1.89 trillion . Which is currently ₹ 1.09 trillion. 

^(Note: While writing this, I used figures like JP¥ 1.892 tr and ₹ 1.093 tr for my calculations, but rounded that last digit off while editing the text, in order to avoid visual confusion with the 4-digit years like 1967, 2067, etc. So the calculation is more precise than it looks.)

Over 50 years at 0.1% interest rates, the amount payable (at the end of 2067) would be JP¥ 1.99 trillion. If the current exchange rate were to remain constant, that would be ₹ 1.15 trillion. But assuming the *peak* exchange-rate in the last 10 years (ie: 0.71872 - July 2012), India would be repaying about ₹ 1.43 trillion. That's *STILL* an interest rate of less than 0.54%, assuming they had loaned us the entire amount in Rupees, instead of Yen.

So effectively, worst case scenario, **we got a loan of a trillion rupees, for 50 years, at a 0.5% interest rate.**

###Now here's where the author's argument (and lack of math) is turned on its' head:

Assuming 0% inflation in Japan, the value of that currency when repaid in Yen will be *equally* valuable in 50 years, as it would be if we paid all JP¥ 1.99 trillion upfront. So they aren't losing anything but time. That's great for them.

But seeing how India's inflation is assumed to be significantly above 0%, the value of the ₹ 1.43 trillion repayment amount in 2067 will actually be *lower*, as perceived within India. Remember, domestic inflation doesn't translate directly into exchange rates. So even if the Yen-Rupee exchange rate becomes horribly high, the domestic inflation would actually *cushion* the sum we would have to pay. 

###Still don't get it? Okay try this: 

Here's a real-life example using real data from the past:

* I used [this link for the calculation of exchange rate](http://fxtop.com/en/currency-converter-past.php?A=1093&C1=JPY&C2=INR&DD=01&MM=01&YYYY=1967&B=1&P=&I=1&btnOK=Go%21)
* I used [this link to calculate inflation](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Let's forget the 'trillions' for simplicity.

Say your Grandpa took a loan of JP¥ 1,892.00, 50 years ago (1967), at 0.1% interest rate, the value of it in Rupees was ₹ 39.42. Today you need to repay the loan as it has been 50 years. You need to pay back JP¥ 1,989.00. According the the present exchange-rate, that comes to ₹ 1,156.00.

Now, back in Grandpa's day, ₹ 1,156 was a lot of money. You could easily pay the rent for 2 months with just ₹ 100. In 1967, ₹ 100 was the average monthly salary in India. ₹ 1,156 would have been nearly **a full year's salary**, back then. Today, ₹ 1,156 is what you pay for 2 large pizzas. In 1967, a Coke was for ₹ 0.05, meaning you could buy 23,120 bottles of Coke with ₹ 1,156. Today, you can buy only 115 bottles of Coke with that amount (the original small glass bottles at that). India experienced a cumulative inflation of ~4000% over the last 50 years. Paying back ₹ 1,156 today, feels the equivalent of [paying back ₹ 30.25 back in 1967](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=30.25&C1=INR&INDICE=INCPI1958&DD1=18&MM1=09&YYYY1=1967&DD2=19&MM2=09&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Meanwhile in Japan, the value of JP¥ 1,989.00 today has only dropped to a third of its' 1967 value ([worth about JP¥ 620.00 of the time](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value)). Japan experienced relatively tiny cumulative inflation of 224% over 50 years.

So your Grandpa paid off a month's rent in 1967, and only had to buy the Japanese lender 2 pizzas 50 years later? And the Japanese lender actually lost money in the process? Huh. Guess that's why interest rates are higher in currencies that have higher inflation rates.

Now obviously, if the author is right, and Japan's inflation remains a flat 0% for the next 50 years, then Japan certainly won't lose any money on this deal. Which is excellent for them! However, it still means that India, with a non-negative inflation rate, will actually be coming out on top, as long as the currency exchange doesn't go absolutely berserk. 

###Assuming a 3% inflation rate, when we pay back ₹ 1.43 Trillion in 2067, it will be as if we were paying back only ₹ 0.326 Trillion (in today's terms). 

^(*assuming the peak conversion rate of the past 10 years: JP¥ - IN₹ 0.71872, which is a worst-case scenario*)

This is because ₹ 1.4 trillion will have far less perceived value (domestically) in 2067, than it does in 2017. 

Put another way, if we take ₹ 326 Billion today, and invest it in a *reaaaalllyyy* shitty-ass mutual fund that only yields 3% interest (that's impossibly pathetic, seriously), then in 50 years, it will easily pay off our 'loan' of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

If you're using a Fixed Deposit scheme that gives 7% interest per annum, **you will only need to invest ₹ 49 Billion.** [Try it for yourself here](http://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php)

So... take this loan of ₹ 1.09 trillion, and put ₹ 49 Billion aside in the 7% fixed deposit account, and use the balance ₹ 1.04 trillion as you see fit... hire strippers, or invest in solar power plants, or build a railway with it. What do you call 1.04 trillion bucks that you can do with as you see fit without needing to pay it back? You call it free money. Obviously, the more wisely you invest it, the better the outcomes will be. But yes, it's effectively free. 

Now, mind you, we aren't getting it as cash, but we *are* getting it as a solid investment that will generate revenue (and pay off its' own dues) and will have further positive externalities (employment, new skills and training, tech-transfer, economic growth of connected areas, increased urbanization, reduced environmental impact, reduced accidents, lower congestion, etc). It will also leave a lot of the money in government coffers available for more investment into other projects over the next few decades, many of which should see some decent returns on investment over the next 5 decades.

Yes, Japan comes out a winner in the deal, ***and so does India!*** The higher our domestic inflation, the cheaper our repayment will seem. Just like Grandpa's ₹ 1156 seems like such a paltry amount, when seen from 50 years later. Obviously we don't want the inflation to be too high, but having a sub-4% inflation rate will keep our economy healthy, while reducing the burden on future taxpayers in paying off this big 'loan'.

This, btw, is the reason you should invest your money and ensure that it gives returns of **at least** 5-7% per annum, in order to beat inflation. Because otherwise, sitting in a bank account, your money is actually **losing** value over time.

> The fares could be in the range of Rs 3000 - Rs 5,000.

^(Source - http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mostly-elevated-partly-under-sea-all-you-need-to-know-about-mumbai-ahmedabad-bullet-train/story-nzG4ROjD9IRE00FcK4fD7N.html)

They want to complete it in 5-6 years, but let's be conservative and just give it 10 years. Let's assume that the next 10 years has all the construction and the low-volume trains running and then just directly jump to the 1200 capacity trains by 2027, for ease of math. That leaves us 40 years to repay ₹ 1.43 trillion, using only train revenues.

The article claims that 1.6 crore people may travel annually initially (that's 44,000 people per day), but that it'll increase to 1,60,000 people per day by 2050. Basically, they intend to increase capacity to 360% over 40 years. Since capacity isn't something that can increase exponentially, we'll assume a linear growth in capacity, from 44k to 160k. The train completes a single trip in 2.5 hours. Assume 30 minute boarding/de-boarding time on either end, a single train will conservatively make 1 full trip in 3.5 hours. That means that a single train can comfortably make 4 trips in a day (14 hours active duty) leaving 10 hours for maintenance and all that jazz. Meaning one train has the capacity to ferry 4800 people per day.


    160000-44000 = 116000 people: increased capacity over 40 years
    116000/4800 = 24 trains: added capacity over 40 years
    (40*12)/24 = 20 months: the time it takes to add one more train to the system.

Basically: One new 1200-seater train is added every 20 months, for 40 years, after a starter-pack of 9 trains (for the initial load of 44k people per day).

So averaged over 40 years, there are around 12+9 trains operating. That gives us 21 trains, making 4 trips a day. (Side note: 21*4: That's 84 trips per day, both ways, meaning that assuming 14 working-hours on a platform, there are 3 trains departing every hour in one direction - one every 20 minutes - convenient). Each trip has a capacity of 1200 people, 365 days a year, for 40 years. 

    21*4*1200*365*40 = 1471680000 passengers total.

1,471,680,000 passengers total: that's **1.47 Billion passengers**. And how much is being charged per seat per trip? ₹ 3000? 

###That gives us a total revenue collection of ₹ 4.415 Trillion. 

Let's assume that the train only runs at 70% seating capacity, on average. They would still collect ₹ 3.09 Trillion. 

[Operational costs will be around ₹ 412 cr (₹ 4.12 billion) per year](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Yearly-bullet-train-operations-to-cost-Rs-412cr-Report/articleshow/39191311.cms) which comes to a total of ₹ 164.8 billion over 40 years. 

That leaves us with ₹ 2.93 Trillion in revenue, with which we need to repay a total loan value of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

**That leaves a cool ₹ 1.496 trillion as pure profit, after paying back every penny of the loan.**

###Wait, what?! 

*You're telling me, we can basically drop the ticket prices to ₹ 1500 per seat (an act that will almost surely yield packed trains every day) and* **still** *pay off the loan?!* 

I dunno! Let's check: 

* 1.471 billion trips * ₹ 1500 = ₹ 2.2075 Trillion. 
* *STILL* assume just 75% occupancy: ₹ 1.656 Trillion.
* Deducting the operational costs leaves: ₹ 1.491 Trillion. 

Hot *damn*, we can pay for the train using just ticket collection, even if we price the tickets at ₹ 1500, and using the most conservative estimates possible. With ₹ 1.656 Trillion revenue, we easily could allow for an increase in ""operational costs"" to ₹ 5.675 billion per year (a whopping **38% increase** in operational costs, compared to the ₹ 4.12 billion figure) and still be able to pay everything off just fine... in just 40 years.

Who in their right minds thinks this is a bad idea? Hell, Ahmadabad-Mumbai Sleeper buses take 8 hours, and charge between ₹ 700-1400. The Shinkansen will be absolutely *flooded* if they drop prices.

But here are my observations so far. These are just my opinion and experiences and may not represent the whole situation accurately

* On Nov 8^th I was pretty happy that the government did it, as I was naive to the whole economy thing I thought it was an ingenious idea to get rid of all the black money

* I was still resistant after a week when 30+ uncles started complaining (note: these were the same uncles & aunties that praised Modi up and down on 9/11 and so did I as a matter of fact )

* Even after 3 weeks i wasn't affected as i was able to withdraw 2000 and 2500 on different occasions quite easily (funny stories btw, first time i walked in to a random ATM where i saw a bunch of people doing something to the ATM machine, i just stood in front of the door and was watching what they were doing, after couple of minutes they looked at me and made a gesture to come in, and when i went the guy in Khaki(idk if he was police) told me i can draw cash now, I proceeded and gave the amount as 400, the Gurkha looked at me weirdly and said the limit was 2000, I couldn't process at the moment what he was saying and thought may be only 2000's notes were there. So i reentered the amount as 2000 and drew a stack of 20 100s! as i turned back i saw a huge ass mob outside the ATM! with people still running towards it as i was heading out of the area! )

* But then afterwards I started thinking if black money was actually eradicated? Then it dawned on me, **This whole thing wasn't about illegal wealth to begin with! The agenda was to make all those out of grid poor people taxable! TAXES! That's it!**

* Think about it. Most of the taxes come from the working middle class people in our country. Now from this move a bunch of poor people have been included to the tax roster, let's be honest, the rich have already been avoiding taxes very intelligently and they wouldn't shell out a paisa no matter how the rules get stricter. Thanks to all the private CA guys who never  made it.

* Then modi announced about releasing records of transactions from his party members **After** 8/11. **BUT** , wouldn't they have already took measures Before 8/11... if we want to be honest here, we should check on ALL politician transactions at least five years prior to this.

* What about black money in the form of foreign currencies? To the uninformed people, Switzerland is NOT the only tax haven in the world, so who ever did have swiss accounts, would've probably switched to somewhere else. So we're not getting that money either.

* All this whole fiasco did was, bringing bunch of poor people in to Tax radar, But they earn so less, we can't actually tax them.

* But i do have a proposal though, we can efficiently use the tax money and skyrocket india's progress, but the people of india needs to involve with the policy making at the root level like people of denmark and some other baltic states do. All we have to do is to have a system where the government still collects taxes but is unable to use the money without the tax payers approval and should give them details for every paisa used.

* people should be given the power of choosing where their tax money is invested into, A nice swimming pool for a minister's residence?: Not gonna give my money.  A public toilet and a public high rise parking lot?: Shut up and take our money.

* But how would we the ^^busy people keep involved in all these process? Well, just like wester countries have Jury duties , india should have a taxer duty, where a group of people are selected from the people investing in a project and are sent to negotiate the process, these people should be non-government citizens and nobody gets to go twice from the same group or similar duration. During that period the taxers should be given paid leaves from their jobs and shouldn't be deducted from their privileged accounts.

* I'm tired now and can't type anymore, but this is my argument. **demonetization was done to bring people under tax watch, but the people we needed in tax watch evaded it any way, this whole scenario was masqueraded as a fight against corruption, which won't stop, but we can smarten up now and demand accountability for our tax money before it gets devoured by our ridiculous politicians and the bureaucracy, because, INDIA!**

**ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS-JOY FOR INC, WAKE-UP CALL FOR BJP**

**Can the Congress upset the odds in 2019?**

The biggest question everybody had before today’s results was can the Congress fight back against Modi and BJP, especially with 2019 around the corner. While their performance in Telangana and Mizoram was disappointing, it will take heart from its wins in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. 

For a party which was in disarray until a year and half ago with no clear sense of direction from the party high command, the Congress has slowly staggered back onto its feet to fight the Modi and Shah duo. With a seemingly reinvigorated Rahul Gandhi at the helm, they have taken the fight to the BJP in Modi’s own bastion-Gujarat, cobbled together an alliance in Karnataka and now snatched Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh back from the BJP. 

While the party is trying hard to capitalise on the anger of the masses against the Central government’s policies and decisions, the Congress still has a lot of work to do on the ground level if it seriously wants to come back to power in 2019. While the results might show Congress winning in three states, there is a very distinct and real possibility that voters were fed up with their state BJP governments due to anti-incumbency and they are still going to vote for Modi to become the PM again in 2019.The Congress’s performance in Rajasthan is also considered to be relatively disappointing with chaotic seat distribution, infighting and rebel Congress leaders costing the party another 15 odd seats.

**What next for the BJP?**

While the results aren’t going to make BJP workers too happy, the BJP still remains in pole position to come back to power in 2019. With the so called ‘Third Front’ still nowhere near fruition and the Congress’s efforts to pitch RaGa against NaMo not exactly gathering steam with other opposition parties means that Modi continues to be the most popular political leader in India currently. The extradition of Christian Michel related to the Agusta Westland scam and the recent court order allowing the extradition of Vijay Mallya from the UK also serve as a timely boost to the BJP’s anti-corruption rhetoric, which was on a slippery slope after the Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi sagas. The BJP has also made no effort to hide its Hindutva agenda, starting with the renaming of Allahabad to Prayagraj and Faizabad to Ayodhya. BJP led state governments in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh also cleared the way for the building of gigantic statues of Lord Shiva and Rama respectively and this Hindutva pitch will only get more brazen in the lead-up to 2019.

While the BJP might be smug about its chances in 2019, it has to keep an eye on the grumbling middle class and farmers-both unhappy with poll promises not being kept. The agrarian distress and lack of job creation have taken the shine off Modi’s ‘booming economy’ pitch and the BJP will be anxious to ensure it doesn’t snowball further. Furthermore, the central government’s rift with the RBI and frequent clash-ins with the Supreme Court have created the image of an overzealous central government keen to take control of all independent central agencies. 

**Will KCR lead for the formation of a Third Front?**

TRS’s emphatic victory in the state of Telangana and K Chandrashekar Rao’s victory speech might mean the resurgence in the chances for the formation of a Third Front consisting of other regional satraps including Mamata Banerjee and Mayawati. The Third Front has traditionally been a cluster of regional parties which choose to neither align with the Congress or the BJP. However, the Third Front, which has always been talked of as an alternative to India’s two-party stronghold, has never managed to give a serious fight to the Congress or the BJP in recent history. The only times the Third Front or Federal Front provided a serious threat to the Congress or BJP was in between 1996 and 1998 when it staked power at the Centre twice under H.D. Deve Gowda. Quite predictably, the government collapsed soon after due to infighting and horse-trading of MPs. 

It will be interesting to see if a Third Front comes into existence in time for 2019 and more interestingly, if they can prevent making the mistakes that they have committed in the past and become a force to reckon with.

**Controversy about EVMs**

Adding further fuel to the EVM tampering controversy, it was reported this week by multiple news sources that CCTV malfunctions occurred in the strongrooms where the EVMs were stored. Technical snags in CCTV systems installed inside the storage rooms came from Vidisha, Mandla and Bhopal. In Vidisha, it is reported that CCTV cameras went blank for 15 minutes while the one in Mandla went blank for 2 hours. Tough questions must be asked of the Election Commission as to how such a situation was allowed to develop in the first place and what it plans to do to ensure the electoral system isn’t compromised.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a5gkqg/a_blog_post_that_i_wrote_abut_the_elections_would/
Policy/Economy,Demolishing Some LCA Tejas Falsehoods,531,4r5hgo,Bernard_Woolley,120,"_""The Tejas is an old design. It has taken 32 long years to develop! And despite being in development for so long, it isn't truly indigenous. Its heart, the engine, is of foreign origin. So are its weapons and some avionics. Furthermore, it is so deficient in its performance, that the Indian Air Force (IAF) wants Rafales/Su-30MKIs/F-16s instead.""_

Every time the Tejas achieves some important milestone, these criticisms are repeated ad nauseum, in the popular media, on Twitter, on internet forums, and at bhel-puri stalls in Jhumritalaiyya. It's infuriating to see an effort of this magnitude, one that has produced [many successes](http://www.ibnlive.com/blogs/india/saurav-jha/the-radiance-of-tejas-a-bright-prospect-for-make-in-india-10879-748651.html), being panned time and again. So I've taken the liberty to put together this handy-dandy LCA Tejas mythbusting guide to counter them.

And without wasting your time any further, I'll jump right in.

**False Argument 1: The Tejas is ""late"". It has been under development for 32 years!**

The figure is technically true, but deprives the narrative of much-needed context. The Tejas’ origins can indeed be traced back to 1983, when the concept of a Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) was conceived. However, the IAF did not finalise its air staff requirements (ASRs) until 1985 and initial funding did not come through until 1986. The project definition phase—the phase in which technical requirements are defined and a conceptual design prepared did not end until 1988. The final design was completed in 1990. Full funding was issued only in 1993, after which the development of a prototype commenced in earnest. See [this list of milestones](http://www.tejas.gov.in/history/milestones.html) for reference.

Following several years of delay in the development process—delays that can at least partly be traced back to overly optimistic R&D timeline projections, scope creep, and [US sanctions on India](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-05-31/news/39655783_1_drdo-chief-v-k-saraswat-lca-project) following the 1998 nuclear tests—the Tejas had its first flight in 2001. From then, the project proceeded at a pace that is not too different that of comparable fighter aircraft development programmes worldwide. It is slated to achieve final operational clearance (FOC), the stage at which an aircraft is considered fully ready for squadron service, in early 2017; fifteen years from the date of the first flight. At this time, the it is expected to be ready to carry out multiple functions: beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air combat, short-range dogfighting, and precision ground attack with a variety of guided and unguided weaponry.

That compares well with contemporary fourth-generation fighters like the Eurofighter Typhoon and the JAS-39 Gripen. The first technology demonstrator of what would later be called the Typhoon first flew [in 1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Eurofighter_Typhoon). The definitive version with an AESA radar is [still not in service today](https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/euroradar-nears-flight-test-phase-for-captor-e-on-ty-416564/), 30 years down the line. The Tranche-2 version, which can drop precision bombs and fire BVR missiles, wasn't available [until 2008](http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/typhoon.cfm). Another European fighter, the Swedish Gripen-C, with full-spectrum capabilities, started entering service in 2002, also fourteen years after its first flight. 

The Tejas is about to FOC with all of these capabilities in late 2016. The fact that ADA managed to achieve similar or better timelines with the Tejas after its first flight, that too without the benefit of half a century of experience in building advanced fighters or the industrial ecosystem that enables such high-technology to proceed swiftly, is an achievement that is not given enough credit.

**False Argument 2: Because of the inordinate delays in development, the Tejas is now deficient.**

Just because the development was delayed doesn't mean that the design is the same one from 1983. The IAF updated its requirements quite often and kept demanding additional capabilities throughout the design and development phase. It was a Catch-22 situation: the constant change in requirements kept the design up-to-date, but it also led to several years of delays because of the need to re-design, re-test, and re-certify subsystems after every modification. Off the top of my head, I can remember that the IAF demanded the following modifications pretty late into the program:

* Open avionics architecture.
* Precision bombing capabilities.
* Heavier A2A missiles (R-73 vs R-60).
* Internal EW suite that included a self-protection jammer.
* Inflight refueling
* More capable radar and missiles (LCA Mk-1A)

With these modifications, the Tejas went from being a simple point-defence interceptor to a full-blown (albeit short-legged) multi-role fighter. 

**False Argument 3: The LCA falls short on several performance parameters like empty weight, range, turn rates, etc. The IAF has allowed 53 concessions/permanent waivers in the design.**

Like the 32-year delay, this too is a scary looking quote that paints a false picture of how fighter aircraft programmes work.

First off, it is important to remember that the Tejas can carry out most of the tasks intended of it quite competently. It can fight other aircraft at beyond visual range (when equipped with an AESA radar and Derby/Derby-ER missiles, it could end up becoming _the most capable_ BVR platform in IAF service). The addition of an Israeli helmet-mounted sight coupled to missiles whose seekers have a wide field of view (R-73 and Python IV/V) make it a fearsome dogfighter and compensate for minuscule shortfalls in aerodynamic performance. It can drop laser-guided bombs on ground targets with great precision. It is also very easy to fly. [In the words of the IAF](http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/air-force-drdo-pleased-with-tejas-performance-at-bahrain-116022200321_1.html), the fighter’s ""control harmony is comparable to the best in the world… The intuitive cockpit layout and highly reliable life support systems provide for comfort as well as excellent situational awareness."" There are many such triumphs; too many, in fact, to recount here.

Secondly, _every_ fighter project concludes with specifications that aren't met, or a few deficiencies in performance. It’s never that big of a roadblock to induction in service. And all said and done, 53 is a very small number as far as design concessions go; a pretty small portion of the entire range of capabilities. Even simpler aircraft (like the [C-17]( http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910528&slug=1285732)) enter service with more deficiencies. These are either compensated with using improvements in other areas to offset performance shortfalls, or accepted in the interest of availability for combat. 

Again, I shall go back to the Eurofighter Typhoon to illustrate my point. Remember I mentioned that it first flew in 1986? Twenty-two years later, it [couldn't independently drop a laser-guided bomb](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/01/eurofighter_austere_air_to_ground_what_joy/) on a target with any precision. Basic BVR combat capability was not available until Tranche 2 models were procured [in 2008](http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/typhoon.cfm), 14 years after the first flight. Even in close air combat, its capabilities were decidedly limited. The helmet mounted sight (HMS)—a system that allows the pilot to cue weapons onto an enemy aircraft by simply turning his head and offers a quantum jump in dogfighting capabilities—did not enter service [until 2010](https://www.eurofighter.com/about-us).

The F-35 was hobbled by similar issues (and terrible program management) [for several years](http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/09/joint-strike-fighter-lockheed-martin). It didn't begin to turn a corner until 2012 or so, after which it began rapidly demonstrating some of the capabilities that were expected of it.

The companies running these projects were aero giants with decades of experience behind them. How then does one expect the ADA, which has never developed a fighter in its entire existence, to deliver a more capable product while experiencing fewer failures? 

Thirdly, the IAF itself works with deficient designs all the time. The Gnat and Su-7, both hobbled by short ranges and limited payloads, were procured in large numbers. The MiG-21, when initially inducted, was underwhelming. Its range was limited and its missiles didn't work. The Bison is still riddled with issues. The Jaguar had a deficient nav-attack suite. It was practically useless in the long range strike role until the IAF and HAL developed and implemented the [DARIN upgrades](https://tkstales.wordpress.com/2010/03/07/the-darin-story/). The MiG-27's navigation system [never performed satisfactorily](http://www.livefistdefence.com/2010/07/special-report-story-of-indias-mig-27.html), and its reliability was terrible. But none of this troubled the IAF. Why then is the LCA failing to achieve a handful design parameters something to raise a huge hue and cry about?


**False Argument 4(a): The LCA isn't really indigenous. Many of its subsystems are of foreign origin.**

But many more of its critical subsystems are of Indian origin too! The first one that comes to mind is the carbon-fibre composite airframe. It is a very high-end product that reduces weight (thus permitting the carriage of a substantial external payload), aids maintenance, brings down manufacturing time, and so on. The fact that some of the technology involved in its manufacture has been exported to Airbus is a testament to its success.

Another example is the digital fly-by-wire (FBW) system, developed from scratch by ADA scientists in India after their work, notes, and equipment was impounded by Lockheed Martin in 1998. No country on earth, not one, has developed such a complex system and gotten it to work perfectly on the first try. It works so well that when it was first tested on an F-16XL in the US (this was before the nuclear tests), it improved the test-bed's handling qualities in several flight regimes. There is a reason the Tejas' test pilots call the aircraft to fly.

There are many other examples. The avionics. The mission computers. The navigation equipment, displays, and human-machine interface. The EW systems. This stuff isn't trivial by any yardstick.

Now coming to the foreign components aboard the aircraft. With the exception of the Americans, and to an extent the Russians, _every_ country has used foreign subsystems extensively in its aircraft designs. The [Gripen](http://www.airframer.com/aircraft_detail.html?model=JAS_39_Gripen) has an American engine, a British airframe design, Swiss carbon-fibre, an Italian radar, an American flight control system, a cockpit with critical components purchased from Britain, and so on. This in spite of the Swedes having an industrial base that is far more advanced than India's and extensive experience developing cold-war fighters such as the Draken and Gripen. The Rafale and Typhoon both use American ejection seats. Their flight control system uses actuators from Moog, an American company. The Russians were buying [Damocles pods](https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/russian-fighters-to-use-thales-damocles-targeting-pods-220747/) for the Su-35s before the French stopped military exports after they invaded Crimea. Nearly every Chinese fighter in service today uses a Russian engine, a Russian ejection seat, and a slew of Russian weaponry. If these aircraft all qualify as ""indigenous"", then surely the Tejas does too?

The choice that Indian design agencies faced was quite stark: should they have tried to build every little component in-house, thus reinventing the wheel at every step? Or used technologies/sub-systems available easily in the market in the initial stages and then made an attempt to indigenise over the life-cycle of the product? It's obvious that the latter was the more sensible path to take.

In the final analysis, the Tejas is an aircraft that has been designed by Indians in India, and is tailored to Indian requirements. If that doesn't make it indigenous, I don't know what does.
	

**False Argument 4(b): Okay, I get that. But the aircraft's very heart, its engine, is fully imported! Surely it's an utter failure on that front?**

Yes and no. It has had a very protracted development cycle, and for good reason. A jet engine is arguably represents the pinnacle of modern technology, making it the most challenging system in the world to develop from scratch. It has to produce ungodly amounts of power for its size and operate at the very edge of what physics allows. The GE F404—which ended up replacing the Kaveri on the LCA—weighs just a shade over 1000 kg and develops close to 80 kN of wet thrust. Assuming that it propels the LCA to Mach 0.9 at sea level (1,100 km/h), it's developing about 24,400 kW or 32,700 hp. That's 32 hp per kg. In contrast, a Formula-1 car engine generates ""only"" 8 or 9 hp per kg, and it's about as far as one can get with piston engines.

What does it take to generate so much power? One needs critical components like turbine blade assemblies that see inlet temperatures of 1,400°C or so while being subject to extreme forces. A back-of-the envelope calculation using rectally extracted figures tells me that a single high pressure turbine blade weighing 50 gm, and rotating at 16,000 RPM at the end of a 500 mm diameter disk, will be subject to a centrifugal force of about 3,500 kgf. Imagine two Honda Civics hanging off a tiny blade that is about as large as two of your fingers held together. There is a transverse load component as well; the 80 kN of thrust is distributed over the turbine blades. 

In order to sustain such loads, exotic materials and precision manufacturing techniques are required. Steel melts at about 1400°C, and starts rapidly losing strength at less than 500°C, so it's obviously not an option. Modern engines instead use nickel-based superalloys. Moreover, the material can't simply be cast or forged or machined into shape. The blade has to be produced via directional solidification or grown out of a single crystal in what looks more like a lab than a production shop. The shape, too, is very intricate. There are internal channels that route cold air taken from the compressor to the surface of the blade to keep it cool.

The fan, compressor, combustor, gearbox assemblies, bearings ... they're just as complex. And they all have to be precision manufactured to ensure that microscopic imbalances don't end up leading to excessive vibrations that could end up destroying the engine and the aircraft while in flight. Then there are requirements like safety, fuel efficiency, minimum total technical life, and reliability that add multiple layers of complexity to the design.

Now imagine the magnitude of effort required to develop something like this, with practically zero infrastructure and very little in terms of  a pre-existing knowledge base. And with skinflint bureaucrats refusing to approve requests for funding, test equipment, or manufacturing tools without documentation being submitted in triplicate and subject to audit after audit.

Now let us talk costs. The GTRE spent [Rs. 2,000 crore](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/rs-2101-crore-spent-on-development-of-indigenous-kaveri-engine-heres-why-theres-been-a-delay/articleshow/48282481.cms), or approximately $640 million in equivalent US dollars (with all the exchange rate and inflation variations that happened between 1989 and now taken into account), on developing the Kaveri. This seems like a lot, until you see that advanced nations spend billions on such programmes, and they almost never develop clean-sheet designs. They are always building on existing knowledge and existing designs. 

[Jeff Immelt, the CEO of GE says](http://www.businessinsider.com/interview-with-ge-ceo-jeff-immelt-on-transforming-ge-2015-12), ""If you could make something with 60 people in a garage, GE shouldn't be doing it. But if you make a jet engine, there's only like one and a half people in the world that can make a jet engine. And we are really good at that. If you want to compete with that, you've got to put yourself on a wayback machine and go back 25 years and invest $1 billion here for 25 years and then _maybe, just maybe_ [emphasis mine], you're going to be able to compete with us.""

Think about that for a second. It requires 25 years. And a billion dollars. And then too, you're more likely to fail than succeed.

The Chinese have been pouring money and espionage resources into their jet engine development efforts (they have budgeted [300 billion yuan](http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-engine-idUSLNE89T00W20121030)—about 45 billion in today's US dollars—over the next 20 years on engine programs alone), and are still facing [significant hurdles](http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-engine-idUSLNE89T00W20121030). Why do people feel that India would get significant results by spending just a few thousand crores?

In any case, the Kaveri isn't a complete write off. A naval derivative, the [Kaveri Marine Gas Turbine](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/built-for-air-force-kaveri-engine-chosen-by-navy-109090800089_1.html) may end up powering Indian Navy vessels. It is also under consideration to [power an Indian UAV](http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/now-kaveri-engine-to-power-indigenous-uav-115073001650_1.html). 

There are civilian spin-offs too. For example, Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) [now uses](http://www.drdo.gov.in/drdo/English/DRDO_BROCHURE_2015.pdf) the investment casting technology developed by GTRE for manufacturing blades for gas turbines used in power generation.

**False Argument 5: In a globalised world, there is no point re-inventing the wheel. The IAF should simply dump it and buy the Gripen/F-16/MiG-35**

What is true for cell phones or cars isn’t true for military equipment. In the long run, in peace and in war, the IAF would be best served by fielding fighters designed and built in India. That's the only way it will equip itself with a large fleet on a (relatively) small budget. There are other advantages to developing the technology in-house: less dependence on foreign suppliers, leading to increased strategic independence. Creation of a stronger local economy and industrial ecosystem. The freedom to tinker with the design and optimise it to suit local requirements without running afoul of IP agreements with the OEM. Spin-offs in the civilian world. And so on and so forth. And if going indigenous is indeed the way forward, then the IAF will have to live with fielding under-performing/problematic designs at the beginning. It will have to make peace with the fact that aerospace R&D is a slow, painful process that is fraught with risk.

That's how practically everyone else did it. The Chinese did not seek out the latest and greatest toy because their initial designs (Q-5, JH-7, J-8, J-10) failed to match up to what the US, Japan, and India fielded. If the J-10B and J-20 are flying today, it is only because the PLAAF and PLAN flew inferior aircraft for decades while their industrial capabilities matured. As it is, the Tejas program's achievements have been quite impressive: the country has developed a fourth-generation fighter that is as good as the Gripen-C from scratch. It uses more home-grown technology than the Gripen does; including such critical subsystems like the digital FBW, the composite airframe, a large portion of the avionics, etc. Many of these have been applied to the IAF's legacy aircraft as upgrade packages. To throw it all away because of a handful of challenges here and there or because Lockheed or Boeing are offering to transfer their manufacturing lines to India would be incredibly, utterly stupid. If the Tejas is cancelled, we will have a repeat of the same thirty-year saga the next time India tries to build her own fighter.

Policy/Economy,"Understanding the Petro Dollar, its possible decline, Fiat Currencies and how it all affects India and Why maybe it's time to look elsewhere to hold foreign reserves.",56,6z7u08,concernadian,45,"The whole thing came up recently during some discussions I had about why people use the dollar for international trade and what would happen if the major economies of the world just stopped using the Dollar. What is the Impact of BRICS. Why US has so many wars in the middle east and they are supposedly for oil but they never really take over any oil. How US is so rich to have 800 military bases around the world with a defence budget larger than the rest of the world combined. About why countries still hold US dollar reserves when US is in trillions of dollars of debt and being in so much debt, how is US economy still afloat? So I thought of putting it together here for myself and anyone else who may want to learn about this. Now, this is what I have gleaned from my reading on the matter. I am no economist so if anyone wants to correct me on anything, I would be welcome to accept the criticism with reference material substantiating your point.

 in 1944, all the countries entered into the Bretton Woods Agreement which basically said that all of the world’s currrecies would be backed by the US Dollar and the US dollar would be backed by gold and any country could convert their currency into US dollars and then redeem US gold in exchange for that at the rate of 35 dollars per ounce of gold. Since US had the largest gold reserves at the time (75% of the entire world's gold), everyone agreed. This also allowed US treasury to fix exchange rates of dollar into different currencies and set the interest rates for interbanking transactions etc. However, the multiple wars of the US during the ’60s caused domestic inflation in the US and the value of Dollar to fall. This caused panic in all the countries and they started redeeming gold from US treasury. The US gold fell from 20,000 tonnes to 8100 tonnes very quickly. Thus, in 1971, Nixon closed the gold window i.e. he suspended the ability of any nation to redeem US gold against dollars and took the gold backing off of the US Dollar. While that allowed US to retain its gold reserves, it made the need of the US dollar among other countries non existent. So everyone started to move away from the Dollar. After that, US economy started to spiral and the price of gold became 135 dollars per ounce. On top of that, the Arab world hiked the oil prices. Now, the US desperately needed to stabilize the spiral. So they brokered a deal with the Saudis that the oil producers would not only trade oil in nothing but US Dollars and convince the OPEC (the middle eastern, north African and other oil producing countries) to do the same but also invest their (OPEC’s) oil profits in US treasury by buying US Treasury bonds. This basically means that they (OPEC) are buying out US debt. Not only this, US is printing Dollars against the amount of Foreign investments in the US treasury which is made by Oil producing nations which are their oil profits. So basically, profits from every barrel sold by OPEC make way to the US treasury and become the value against which dollars is printed. Ultimately, more the profits in oil, stronger the dollar and lesser the profits in oil, weaker the dollar. Thus US gets a double benefit out of every barrel of oil in a way. In exchange the US would sell them (Saudis) advance weapons and all the gold they demanded. (So basically weapons and gold sale in exchange for trading oil in dollars props up US dollar. Gold is still propping up US dollar indirectly by forcing the oil producers to trade in dollars). Thus the petrodollar was born. This caused the world to need US dollar again. If you wanted to buy oil, you needed US dollar by either converting your currency or by selling stuff to the US. The latter is more preferred as it is cheaper than exchanging your currency and also grows your economy. So once again, US became the benchmark of international trade since no country can hope to grow its economy without using energy aka oil and you can’t have oil without US dollars. As long as all these countries need oil, US can just print Dollars out of thin air and balance it against oil barrels (as explained above) without actually even owning a single drop of oil. (Other countries need to own the gold that they balance their currency against). US does not need to control oil, they just need to control the currency it is traded in to keep their economy afloat. (more on that later in US foreign policy). Similarly, US bokered a deal with the Latin American countries to not only trade in the US Dollar but also to give precedence to US, EU and Japanese products in trade. So if more and more countries decide to shun the dollar and trade in other currencies, this would eventually cause OPEC to switch as well and Dollar could collapse.

How? Well, US is basically just printing enormous amounts of money out of thin air. This money is being used domestically and to a much larger extent, globally. If international oil trade in dollar stops, people stop needing the dollar and use their own currency. So all the internationally circulating dollars would come back to US. Now that is just too many dollars against very little amount in the treasury and that would cause hyperinflation and economic spiral. However, the logical next step would be to just destroy the excess dollars coming in from abroad and that would keep the country’s economy afloat. While that is okay but remember, what is the dollar being printed against? The foreign investments in the treasury which are the profits from the oil trade in dollars. That would go away as well essentially leaving nothing in the treasury against which the dollar is valued. Hence dollar will literally not be worth the money it is printed on.

Second, since US currency is basically a petrodollar, its power depends on the control of oil. So right now, whoever controls middle east has major power. Today, Saudi Arabia controls Middle East and US controls Saudi Arabia. US-Saudi brotherhood sort of makes it impossible for other countries to have an influence over this. Russia has tried for decades to establish a strong foothold in the middle east but has been unsuccessful. It has also dictated the US foreign policy far the last 5 decades. Like I said, US needs to control not the oil reserves but the currency oil is traded in. Hence all the wars we hear that were for oil, were not actually for oil per se but intimidation tactics against countries that announced that they would no longer accept dollar as a currency in international oil trade. Egs When the Ayatollah of Iran announced their intention to denounce dollars in oil trade and use their own currency instead, US backed Iraq to go to war with Iran and even provided the Weapons of mass destruction to use on Iran that they later used as an excuse to invade Iraq and prosecuted Saddam Hussein for. When Iraq invaded Kuwait ( a major producer of oil) to be able to pay their loans to Kuwait and then later asked for Euro to be used for oil trade rather than Petrodollar, US invaded Iraq. When Gaddafi asked gold based Dinar instead of US dollars for oil trade, US invaded Libya. When Chavez did the same, Us staged a coup in Venezuela. However, starting a non-petro currency would break this link and oil and Middle east would become less relevant for Economic power and only be of interest for energy concerns. It is still important but less so than a economic and geopolitical chessboard of US that it is today. It may actually be a solution to achieving peace in the middle east.

However, another thing that happens is Middle East controls prices of oil which is tied to the Dollar. Recently, the Middle East (OPEC or basically Saudi Arabia) has decided to drop the international prices for their own economic reasons. Now, the countries that have oil production as a major source of revenue and trade in dollars eg many N African countries, Venezuela have seen their economy completely stabilise and destroyed. These countries are sick of US and Saudi controlling the markets in a way that affects other countries adversely. Hence, for these countries, switching to the international trading system of a gold based currency will cause their economies to stabilise.

The international reserves of EU etc, on the other hand have seen increased holdings by the OPEC countries and have been worried of increasing power of these countries in the international banking system. They would be only to glad to get rid of these holdings.

Now, non Dollar currency would cause a fall in the US dollar value. In lieu of that, here is another thing that needs to be considered. A lot of the developing countries have international trade deficits. Now these trade deficits can be in the currency of the country to whom the debt is owed or any other internationally accepted currency eg. the Dollar. If the debt is in dollars, the conversions and interest rates of borrowing are determined according to the rules of the US treasury. Again, the rates in the US treasury are linked to the value of dollar. Most countries giving out loans prefer to do so in dollars as historically the Dollar is strong and trusted not to collapse and hence the money they owe is safe. The countries taking loans also convert their debts to dollars as it is easier and the country to whom the debt is owed cannot just up and change the value of the debt owed by manipulating their currency as dollar has determined the conversion into other currencies at fixed rates, so it is safe for everyone. However, there is a slight problem with this. If you owe a debt of 1 dollar to someone, when you pay the debt, it will depend on the value of dollar to your currency at that particular instant. So if dollar has gotten stronger wrt to your currency, you shall have to pay more money and if the dollar has gotten weaker, you will owe less money in your currency. Hence the fall of the dollar would be beneficial for the countries who owe debt in dollars and bad for the countries who have loaned out debt in dollars.

Also, taking debt in dollars becomes cheaper if the value of dollar falls since the US treasury interest rates are directly tied to dollars, hence it becomes cheaper to borrow in dollars. Also, as I said, if it grows weaker still, yo will owe less money.

One more thing to consider regarding fall of the Dollar is this. Uptil now, the oil producers have been buying US treasury bonds due to the Bretton Woods deal. Other countries and US and other corporations do so too. Now, the US treasury gives a fixed rate of interest to those investing in the treasury. This rate, in turn is linked to the value of the dollar. Stronger the dollar, more the interest on US Treasury bonds and more the foreign countries invest in it. Now this means that these foreign countries would much rather invest their money in US Treasury at an assured fixed rate of interest than invest it in 3rd world countries and take a risk of maybe losing it. However, if the value of dollar were to fall, the countries would much rather draw out of the US treasury and invest more in the startups in different countries, domestically etc.

The other side of the same coin would be the countries dependent on US investment. Should the value of the dollar fall, the investment being received from the US would be of a lesser value.

On the other hand, there is one more thinh. Like I said, investments in dollars are governed by the US treasury rules. Now, basically, US banks have cut the taxes on money transfer and conversion, artificially keeping them very low to fuel the domestic and world trade etc . If the dollar were to collapse, people wouldn’t trade in dollars. They would trade in other currencies. The inetrbanking across the world would be then governed by the rules of the currency you trade in, for eg, BRICS nations will follow the tariffs etc of the Shanghai Bank where most of the reserves are held. So that effect would then depend on the rules of the bank you deal with and that can be detrimental or beneficial depending on the bank’s policies compared to the dollar.

Also, countries having holdings in the US treasury would lose the entire value of their foreign reserves. On the other hand coountries like BRICS who have their reserves in other international banks would retain the value of their foreign reserves in those banks.

What does this mean?

Indian Currency would also fall with the fall of the dollar in its current state. Now, we usually run around with the perception that Indian currency is backed by gold, That’s not true. The truth is 99% of today’s currencies US Dollar, Euro, Indian rupee, all of them are fiat currencies i.e. their value is not determined by the gold they hold but by the economic strength of the government. Only an average of 4–7% of any country’s currency is today, backed by gold. US Dollar - 4.5%, Indian rupee - 5%. The rest is held in the terms of foreign reserves in other countries like in the form of US Dollar (around 70%) in US treasury bonds, in world bank or IMF, in other currencies (around 25%) in BRICS and other foreign reserves etc. Currently if you have rs 1000 , only rs 50 is gold, around 670 is held in the form of US dollars and Rs 280 in other currencies. You might ask why is that? Well, remember the Bretton Woods agreement. At that time US had 75% of the world’s gold which backed dollar and dollar backed other currencies so most of the currency of any country was backed directly or indirectly through dollar by gold. Now, it is difficult to keep gold in your country so it was convenient for other countries to just hold foreign reserves in dollars especially with the fixed exchange rates they provided. Hence more and more portion of their currency was being held in dollars. However, after Nixon shock of 1971, dollar removed its gold backing. So, automatically all other currencies that were backed by dollar (99% of the world currencies) also became fiat currencies as a result. However, the dollar was still good and trusted so no one thought much of it, especially since dollars were being printed out of thin air. However, now with the prospect of the trust in dollar fading, this as started to worry some experts. Because of the senseless printing of dollars and in exchange all the fiat currencies, the total amount of currency can nowhere near be compensated by the gold reserves even if all the gold in the world was put together. It would form not more than 10% of the currency in the world. Now, putting this disturbing detail aside, if Dollar were to collapse, 670 rupees of your 1000 would become worthless, too. So, it isn’t wise to hold US dollars, is it? No its, not and many countries have woken up to that fact.

China has been secretly amassing large amounts of gold. OPEC countries have started removing their capital from US treasury. See, these oil producers have been receiving US gold in exchange for trading oil in US dollars and have accumulated holdings in other countries’ treasuries. Now with all the crazy gold they have received they have bought material assets like real estate etc even in other countries. Now, they can simply sell out their US treasury bonds and buy more assets such as gold and real estate from it, which they have been doing in the recent years. Now, this will start depleting the treasury and cause the fall in the value of the dollar in turn causing other countries to withdraw and invest elsewhere. That, coupled with Russia and China doing trade in Roubles and Yuan, India and Iraq trading oil outside of dollar, Germany and China trading outside of Dollar, the strenghtening of BRICS bank etc, Dollar has been showing a steady decline. So India should also wisen up and start replenishing its treasury with gold and sell off holdings in dollars and euros and invest in other currencies on the rise. This is one reason BRICS could be very important for India and other countries in BRICS whether we like it or not. 

Another thing that using another currency would do, it would take away the power of the US to slap economic sanctions on whichever country they choose. This is one of the major reasons Putin has teamed up with China - in order to bypass US sanctions.

*[Edit: The thing that worries most nations is this - having international trade and foreign reserves in dollars gives US a single handed say on their economies. Just like Nixon's unilateral decision changed the fate of all currencies, other decisions by it can also change their economies. US can dictate their rules and if you don't follow them - sanctions. So the countries want to take back the power of making decisions in their own hands.*

*Next, the petrodollar is based on a commodity that is being depleted. Oil reserves are declining and the world is moving towards other sources - gree energy, nuclear energy etc. So the petrodollar decline is destined. However, what would US do next? They could shift to backing their currency with nuclear reserves or some new crazy idea out of someone's hat. That will, inevitably affect all other countries and they want to and should have a say in it.]*

On the other hand, China's attempt to start a gold backed currency may not pan out because like I said all the gold in the world is not sufficient to back all the currencies in the world. Also, since most currencies still have a large amount of dollar backing, fall of the dollar would make that percent of the currency valueless and therefore even having a reserve in another foreign currency could still cause a fall in Indian currency though it might be a little mitigated. On the other hand, fiat currencies are run by the investors' trust in the currency. So even if the dollar falls, a fiat currency with foreign reserves in the dollar may not fall because the confidence in that currency is still high. Sadly, such a currency would be Chinese Yuan. So, the policy to fix this? I am still trying to work on that solution. This is a post in evolution. My thoughts on this are still in evolution and I would really like some economists to come and hold a serious, well informed and sane discussion on this.

 I will add more when other points occur to me or are brought forward to me in any online or offline discussions.

The British recruited heavily from rural Punjab for it’s armed forces, and recognized that is was vital to keep rural Punjab prosperous and satisfied. The government invested heavily in irrigation and enacted laws favorable to farmers. Famine nearly struck Bihar and Maharashtra in the after independence, and the new government was desperate to raise agricultural yields. The government of India embraced the Green Revolution, and no region more than Punjab. Punjab led India in the adoption of high value seeds, irrigation and fertilizer. An entire policy regime was constructed to benefit farmers and to increase food production.
However, this policy regime is misfiring badly today. The Green Revolution is over in Punjab, and the state is struggling to reorient itself in an economy where agriculture is no longer paramount. Free electricity to farmers to keep pumps running constantly, causing the water table to drop to dangerous levels while starving the state government of the funds necessary to modernize the economy.

Policy/Economy,My experience with the answers of Quora on Government,64,749dxv,calvinwalterson,29,"Before 2014 I was a daily user of quora but once they started there selfless work of promoting government for each and everything and when the crowd of wannabe top writer started throwing senseless answers on stupid question after taking weed. I was forced to quit. But I didn't unsubscribe from Quora digest.

Every alternate week I see there is a question on work related to government in Quora digest. And despite knowing what kind of answer it is going to have 7 out of 10 times, I try to read that. 
I have seen it all from giving them a little bit of time to proving how good demonetization was. 

There is usually a pattern in answers if the question is normal one like, how Modi is performing in his constituency then typically top response have this pattern. 
First, he will put a discloser why he eligible for giving this answer it could be, the writer himself belongs to the same constituency to he visited this place twice, one before 2014 and one after 2014. After that discloser,  couple of pictures from Varanasi in the night from the perfect angle where you can't see the filth. And with that, he will assure you that   Varanasi is literally transformed into a world-class city. Despite the well-known fact that Varanasi is not just restricted to Ghats of Ganga rest of the answer will focus on that, and there will be a rosy picture in front of you. The list put in front of you will mostly a daily news article like Modi gave a gift of x crore to Varanasi and there was a project that started only by great leader etc. Now, what would you expect from a guy who lives there is to put a picture of how his life is changed like electricity, roads and healthcare facility, he is getting after 2014, but no I will throw every random project news about Varanasi without the follow up on that project. Are bahi! ager news article ki project started or gifted vali news headline hi padhni thi to question kyu puchta. 

Another instance if the question is about the health of the economy or something like demonetization. Where people are vocal means, there is less excuse to make. Then ignoring all the facts on how government changed his stance from the attack on black money to increasing cashless transaction. The writer will simply put forward his own theory or a new theory produced by Sir Sambit Patra. One of the theory was now the government have a big database of people who submitted their money it will be easy peasy Japanesey to find defaulters. In the end, there will be some statement from hotshot banking firm head backing their theory and proving how India is headed toward glorious future. Despite the well-known fact how crores of money renewed through bank staff as well as through traveling agencies, daily wage workers, and jan dhan account.  

There are some instances where they pull legs on failed policies like make in India and poor river health but don't know how they forget the name of our beloved PM and his party in that answer. It's all about how bad Indian citizen then. If river Ganga is still filthy then only people are responsible about that because they throw religious material in it. But they closed eyes when Mr. Modi along with his fellas dropped religious stuff in the river during the live telecast of Narmada dam inauguration. 

Justification on how it is just cow cow and cow everywhere is simply it is not new, and it is going on from ages. It was Nehru who started all this. And our beloved leader is so good he never question his elders work. Then why would he question work of Chacha Nehru? He is just following his footstep.

Justification on why farmers are dying and rape is a big problem is again it is not new, and the X country is actually a top-ranked country in this. Just don't dare to question our leader.
One of the top writer and flag bearer of Indian diaspora on Quora said something amazing when asked why they act like the lawyer of government. 

> For the same reason Sachin, Steve Jobs and a variety of people are staunchly defended by their fans. You might not have agreed with every one of Sachin’s shots [especially the silly shots he got out] but would desert him for that?
Modi was elected by crores of voters. Some of these might have voted because they thought there is no alternative. But, there is a sizeable chunk of voters who voted because they believed. They believe this government is theirs and not some random entity like we have often behaved in the past.
If you assume Modi’s string of victories in state elections is a fluke and that a sizeable chunk of people don’t truly adore him, you don’t understand the evolving Indian politics.
In a way this is democracy - where people feel ownership in the government. Look at US politics and the same happens - where common people feel ownership and stake in politics and fight for their ideology.
When you believe it is yours, you will fight for it. 

Yeah, I will fight for it, and I will fight for every single penny I gave through tax and different types of cess. And question government why things don't change instead of supporting them for each and every idiotic move.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/749dxv/my_experience_with_the_answers_of_quora_on/

Post below and I'll add.

Note that I haven't included anything about their manifesto because I will give them 2 more years before we see any effect.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3727an/how_does_bjp_justify_this/
Policy/Economy,Sardar and Legacy [Spiritual Translation of Two Marathi Articles],3,9tsmlb,ArchangelleSnek,3,"The credit for integrating almost all princely states, barring three, before 15 August 1947 undoubtedly goes to Sardar Patel. But he was of tired body and mind post-independence and post-Gandhi assassination.

It's one thing to like historic fables and another to consider them history. There are often efforts to sell these fables as history. But it's time to look for true history. Currently certain fables are sold as history. Some of them are: Sardar Patel was Hindutvavadi and subsequently anti-Muslim, if he was leading the country instead of Nehru then all of our problems (i.e. Pakistan and Jammu-Kashmir) would've been solved already. Due to wishes of masses, these misunderstandings are considered history. There's effort to sell these fables as history.

First let's tackle most lethel delusion. That is had Mahatma Gandhi not put his weight behind Pandit Nehru, then Sardar Patel would've been our first Prime Minister. A most liked fable in halls of Whatsapp university. Reality however, begs to differ. Pandit Nehru wasn't chosen as Prime Minister at the last minute. It had been going under consideration since 1929. At that time Purna Swaraj (Declaration of Independence of India) under consideration which was officially announced on 26 January 1930. It's leadership came easily under Nehru because he was 2nd most popular leader of Indian National Congress after Gandhi. Then there was a challenge of elections as per Government of India Act 1935. For that, there was no other option than to handover the party presidentship to Nehru. The popularity necessary to win the elections was with Gandhi and Nehru. Sardar Patel was main fundraiser and chairman of Congress' Central Parliamentary Board at that time. However it meant Nehru had bigger responsibility since as a President, he was the face of the party. That is the reason why in 1942 Gandhi declared him as successor. The whole party stood with him and so strong was the resolve that in 1946 - a year before independence - Maulana Abul Kalam Azad resigned presidentship for Nehru.


It's interesting to check the delusions of people who claim Sardar should've been the Prime Minister. After his release from prison in 1945, he was not in good health. He was struggling with diabetes and blood-pressure and his mind was gloomy because of family issues. He had severe heart attack on 4 March 1948, barely a month after Gandhi assassination. Even doctors had given up hopes. Sardar survived but it took a toll on his health. He had said that next news won't be of my sickness but of my death. He died in December 1950. He didn't live to see first general election in India. Nehru was 15 years younger to him. Sardar belonged to generation of Gandhi and Jinnah and three of them died shortly after independence. Sardar Patel's own words are enough to remove any doubt about his desire for Prime Ministership. ""Desire demands youth and health. We have none."" He even conceded that the crowd at Bombay rally had 'come for Jawahar, not for me'.

This should tell us how unrealistic it is to claim Sardar for PM.


Now let us talk about partition. Sardar Patel was one of the first people to agree to partition proposal by Mountbatten. Nehru accepted it later. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad on the other hand, staunchly opposed partition till the end. He was of the opinion that India shouldn't be divided. He himself had written it in his 'India Wins Freedom'. It might be politically incorrect to speak highly of Azad in current political climate. But it is documented history. Patel was first one to accept the truth that it isn't right to make Hindus suffer for dream of Undivided India. Nehru and Gandhi followed him to accept the bitter reality. So all three of them are equally 'responsible' for partition. It is  politically convenient to blame partition on Gandhi and Nehru. But it isn't reality. 

Finally, let's talk about his love for Hindutva. He had none as documented by many historians and journalists such as Narhar Kurundkar, Govindrao Talvalkar, Ramchandra Guha, Rafiq Zakaria, even American Vincent Sheean. He had major role in giving religious roles to Indian Muslims. Minority Institues also have special rights thanks to Patel. He never opposed leadership of Khan Abdul Gafar Khan in Northwest region, nor did he oppose Shaikh Abdulla in Kashmir. Not just that, but he never felt to limit rights of Indian Muslims after creation of Pakistan. It is also history that he had admonished Uttar Pradesh's then Chief Minister  Govind Vallabh Pant after idols of Rama were placed in Babri Masjid in 1949. He was of the opinion of resolving the matter through talks. There's also no example of Patel giving different treatment to Hindu and Muslim rulers of Princely states. Hindu Maharaja of Travancore intended to stay independent. So there's no reason to claim that Patel's politics was motivated by religion.  Infact, his outlook towards RSS changed after Gandhi Assassination. Even though the ties between RSS and Gandhi Assassinations were never proved, he was of the opinion to ban it along with Hindu Mahasabha. 

----

A reader called me to accuse that ""your favourite JRD had said, if Sardar Patel had become the Prime Minister, India would have followed a different path and we could have been in a better economy than we have today"". I spoke with him and by the end of the call he had change of heart. Why? Let's see.

History tells us that Gandhi's economic policies were opposed by Nehru and Patel and two of them also had difference of opinion about it. Nehru's economic policies had layer of naive socialism. Which gave birth to state-owned enterprises. It spread so much that goverment was making wristwatches. Nationalization was core of his economic policies. It's as if he hated the idea of profit. 

JRD and Nehru had disagreement about this point. JRD was of the opinion that it's not government's job to run airline company. It should be noted that JRD's favourite child, Air India was nationalized by Nehru. Patel agreed with JRD on opinion that businesses should be left to businessmen. JRD's opinion was in this context, ""if Sardar Patel was a younger mand and had become the Prime Minister, India would have followed a different path and we could have been in a better economy than we have today""

Now the caller didn't take into account Patel's health. Nor did JRD speak about Nehru's popularity and politics. His only focus for comparison was economy.

Now let's come to present. Nehru's economic policies were criticised by many political parties, including the one currently in power. The criticism includes inefficieny, irresponsibilty, unnecessary hirings and expenses etc. 

Narasimha Rao took stand against this love for state-owned enterprises. Him and Manmohan Singh opned the doors for economic liberalization. Rao was throughly Congressman. But he didn't hesitate to throw policies of his predecessor in the can. Atal Bihari's government came close to Rao's. He pushed privatization and sold state enterprises operating at loss. As a member of BJP he had right to can Nehru. 

Now Vaypayee's party came to power in 2014. This part is business-friendly and progressive. So it was a given that PSU's will get evem more freedom. Sins of Congress had resulted in loss in banks, air india, and other state enterprises. The BJP's admiration for Patel meant that even more economic improvements would be done. As a sign of their admiration, this goverment decided to build a monument for Patel. So far Congressis had ignored Patel so these people decied to build a statue so tall, you could not ignore it. That's how you pay tribute to your heros!

Around 3000 crores Rupees were spent for this glorious monument. Who paid for it? The caller didn't know. 

So this is the list of generous people who contributed to this monument, in Rupees:

- Indian Oil - 900 Crores

- Oil and Natural Gas Commission - 500 Crores

- Bharat Petroleum - 450 Crores

- Hindustan Petroleum - 250 Crores

- Oil India - 250 Crores

- Gas Authority of India - 250 Crores

- Power Grid - 125 Crores

- Gujrat Mineral Development Corporation - 100 Crores

- Engineers India - 50 Crores

- Petronet India - 50 Crores

- Balmer Lawrie - 6 Crores

Does the list ring any bell? All of these are Government owned companies. Who were born because of Nehruvian economics and policies,  which was opposed by Sardar Patel. And his monument is now funded by the same companies.

And the money comes from Corporate Social Responsibility funds of these companies, even written down for preservation ofr arts and culture by some of them.

Who is preserving whose which legacy? Food for thought.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9tsmlb/sardar_and_legacy_spiritual_translation_of_two/
Policy/Economy,SaveTheInternet.in is live. Status Check on Net Neutrality consultations - June 2016,189,4n4o1d,atnixxin,129,"**tl;dr**

Preconsultation paper on NetNeutrality is just the first step of that process: consultations on throttling and VoIP will follow. Have to prevent fast lanes for the throttling paper. We're likely to lose the battle to prevent licensing of VoIP.

Free data paper is very tricky and we're now opposing databack models, after further examination (explained below). 

[SaveTheInternet.in](http://www.savetheinternet.in) is now live, in case you need help mailing the TRAI. We have only 8 days to go till the deadline. 

We'll publish our long submission tomorrow for public comments.

**Longer version**

So, we have two processes going on right now, and a third and fourth coming up soon. First the easy stuff:

**Preconsultation paper on Net Neutrality**: Includes all the issues remaining from the consultation last year in March, when all of us got involved for the first time. /u/shadowbannedguy1 has a submission he sent to this. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4lucjl/the_trai_has_a_new_consultation_paper_on_net/
Important to note that this isn't a consultation but a preconsultation paper. This means there's more to follow. O_O

**Consultation paper on Throttling:** will follow after the pre-consultation paper mentioned above. We have to be careful about telcos getting fast lanes for specialized services, and also them having the ability to charge netflix and youtube a congestion fee, because it takes away from the rest of access.

**Consultation paper on licensing of Internet Telephony**: will follow after the consultation paper mentioned above. It is likely that the two consultations will be separate because the TRAI can regulate throttling under QoS (Quality of Service), but it can only recommend licensing of Internet Telephony/VoIP. I remember hearing that the VoIP consultation will take place in July, but you never know. This will be a tough one to win (as in, no licensing) because the MHA wants it to snoop on your calls, and pretty much everyone in the government would want access to VoIP. Telcos are arguing regulatory arbitrage, and the DoT had recommended licensing. TRAI seems to be open to the idea of recommending this. To quote the TRAI Chairman: 
“An application is providing the same service that a telecom company is providing. TSP provides the service under a licence, communications-based OTT don't provide it under any licence. There is a regulatory imbalance.” [Source](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/52528968.cms)

**Now the clear and present danger**

**Consultation paper on Free Data**
TRAI has issued a consultation paper on free data, looking at models which allow giving free data to users. It says now that it is considering models which allow an independent platform (not a telco) to zero rate itself, or give free data for how much data was consumed. We hadn't focused on this extensively in the last consultation and we thought data back was kosher, but on further examination, we're don't think it is: We're opposing data back related to consumption of data because it has the same impact as zero rating of an individual site or a group of sites. The only difference between this model and airtel zero is that data consumed is being given back to a user after data usage, instead of during data usage. So, I use 11.3 mb of wynk, and the platform gives me 11.3 mb. It doesn't dictate that I use the 11.3 mb only for wynk, but it has effectively made my cost of using wynk zero. The TRAI chairman has also made some worrying statements:

“Free Basics had essentially tied up with Reliance Communications. So, if you went through the Reliance pipe, these sites were free. If you went through the Airtel or Vodafone pipes, these sites were not free. It's as though a shop in (Delhi's) Connaught Place is giving discounts but to only those who come in a bus provided by Mr X. If you don't come by that bus, no discount. That is not a good thing. If you give a secular discount, it is fine.” [Source](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/we-had-a-problem-with-free-basics-because-it-gave-free-data-only-to-those-who-went-through-rcom-pipe-ram-sevak-sharma-116053000014_1.html) 

[SaveTheInternet.in](http://www.savetheinternet.in) is now live. We have only 8 days to go till the deadline. 

P.s.: Apologies for the delay, but many of us had to go back to our actual jobs (and a couple of us had a pretty big mess to deal with because we were away from work for most of last year). So it's been tough getting ourselves going again, but a few of us have put in a lot of work over the past four days on this. This will be our 5th participation, after TRAI, DoT, Parliamentary Standing Committee and TRAI again, since March last year.

Policy/Economy,India bullying Bhutan?,46,6q4rou,rorschach34,36,"I came across this post in my FB feed where a Bhutanese woman was criticising India in an International Relations forum. It is a great read and a different perspective altogether. It would be great if you guys can share your views on the post. 

WARNING - Long wall of text

------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHO IS BULLYING BHUTAN?

On 26th June 2017, The Times of India posted a video on YouTube claiming to show Chinese and Indian troops jostling and shoving each other on what The Times commentator said is “Indian land” on the “Indian side” of the Sikkim border. He accused China of “aggression” and the Chinese troops of being “extremely aggressive.”

A few days later, it emerged that the dispute had nothing to do with Indian land. The China-India confrontation was taking place on the China-Bhutan border. Yet Chinese and Indian media quickly roused patriotic fervour and railed against each other.

Chinese media said India would be “kicked out”, “taught a bitter lesson” and “suffer greater losses than in 1962. One Chinese editorial mocked India’s claim to be defending Bhutan and accused India of treating Bhutan as a “vassal state” and forcing it to support India.

Meanwhile an Indian headline read: “China: The World’s Bully”, and another article called China “a geopolitical bully….The mere fact that a vastly bigger country like China is indulging in such antics against a peaceful neighbour like Bhutan shows the extent to which Beijing will stoop to, to occupy territory illegally, slicing it off like a salami, just like it's done with India.”

Through such welter of mutual recriminations and accusations, Bhutan’s media remained remarkably quiet and reserved, with “no aggressive posturing”, as reported by the Hindustan Times. And why should there be? The vast majority of Bhutanese have no interest in the remote, barren, high altitude Doklam Plateau, and have not even heard of it.

But the 89 sq.km. parcel does have strategic importance to India that sees Chinese presence there as a “dagger” pointed at its narrow and vulnerable 21-km wide “chicken’s neck” that links it to its northeastern states. And so, Bhutan’s initial quiet restraint was not good enough for India, and Bhutan quickly fell into line.
On 3rd July FirstPost headlines read: “Bhutan vents out first major disclaimer against Chinese, sides with India…” The article went on to say: “Bhutan, for the first time has taken a major stand against China's incursions …. Bhutan's stand against Beijing… goes on to show the country's unwavering alliance and support for big brother India.”
And that characterization itself raises a big question: Who precisely is bullying Bhutan? And what exactly are Indian troops doing on Bhutanese land in the first place? Just defending poor little Bhutan against big China’s bullying “aggression”? Who, in fact, is more seriously threatening Bhutan’s sovereignty and independence – China or India?

When “friendship” turns to control.

In fact, India has maintained a strong military presence throughout Bhutan for half a century, exercising its power and influence in every corner of Bhutanese life. Even in the remote and strategic areas of northern Bhutan, far from anything Indian, Indian soldiers exercise their authority and control the movement of local Bhutanese. Convoys of Indian military trucks travel freely across Bhutan and cannot be checked for contents by the Bhutanese authorities. The Indian army has occupied the Haa Dzong for decades, and has given no indication of handing it back to the Bhutanese. The Dzongs have since the time of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel, the founder of Bhutan, been a seat of power and a symbol of governance.
It is noteworthy that Indian troops’ efforts to block Chinese road construction on the Bhutan border are portrayed in Indian media as stopping China from building roads into India – revealing just how little respect the Indians really have for Bhutanese “sovereignty.” But such spin is not surprising. In Bhutan, the IMTRAT (Indian Military Training) General, and Indian Ambassador both residing in the two most prized real estates in the capital, are said to be the most powerful men in the country, even determining what does and does not get published in the national media.

When Bhutan obtained Asian Development Bank funding for a strategic highway linking its east and west, to avoid the necessity of Bhutanese travel through troubled, strike-prone and often violent Assam and West Bengal, India vetoed the plan. The highway was cancelled and Bhutan remains dependent on India’s grace and mercy for its own internal east-west transit. Just a few weeks ago an angry mob of Indians beat up a Bhutanese truck driver and set his truck on fire for being involved in a road accident.
But this Indian interference and infringement on Bhutanese sovereignty extends far beyond the military-strategic sphere into every aspect of Bhutan’s political and economic life.

Thus, Bhutan is the only sovereign independent nation in the world that has no diplomatic relations with any of the five permanent U.N. Security Council members – the US, UK, France, China and Russia – only because India, jealous of its exclusive hegemony over Bhutan and fearful of any competitive influence, won’t allow it.
Japan has long been a friend of Bhutan, helping fund many developmental projects in Bhutan. The Japanese wished to have an embassy in Bhutan, to foster closer ties and more development projects. However, firm plans and agreement to build a Japanese Embassy in Thimphu were abruptly cancelled, once again due to India’s disapproval.

When China invited Bhutan to exhibit at its Shanghai EXPO in 2010, offering a free pavilion that would be a central installation in the EXPO, India forbade Bhutanese participation. Independent sovereign nations from the world over took part in the EXPO sans Bhutan. India, even if they forbade Bhutan, went and participated in the EXPO, even building a pavilion of their own. India regularly nixes Bhutanese official and commercial missions and visits to China, though it conducts its own with impunity, apparently due to Indian disapproval of potential competition with its own overweening influence.

More ominously, India has blatantly interfered in Bhutan’s elections and political processes. India strongly objected to Bhutan’s former Prime Minister forging extensive new diplomatic ties and carving out an independent foreign policy, and was furious when the Prime Minister simply met and talked with China’s Premier at the Rio + 20 conference. And so, India decided to get rid of him.
Just days before the 2013 elections, India removed its subsidies on liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene, thereby doubling and tripling prices on these essential commodities, to signal its disapproval of the existing government. The cynical tactic worked, and a new government far more compliant and obedient to India’s will and interests was elected.

Hydropower – cooperation or colonization?
But the cornerstone of India-Bhutan “cooperation” for three decades has been the hydropower that is a cheap power boon to India’s growing economy, and which accounts for fully 40% of Bhutan’s revenues and 25% of its GDP. Indian financing, which has switched from 70% grant and 30% loan to 30% grant and 70% loan at higher interest rates, is also the direct cause of Bhutan’s escalating debt that has even further deepened Bhutanese dependence on India.

Since, July 2006, when Bhutan and India agreed to develop 10,000 MW of hydropower from ten large projects, the benign sheen of this apparent cooperation has quickly faded as commissioned projects were delayed and costs mushroomed. Costs jumped $US 240 million at Mangdechhu; they doubled at Punatsangchhu–II, and they tripled at Punatsangchhu–I (from $US 500 million to $1.5 billion), and no end in sight.
And those costs obviously don’t include massive environmental damages for which future generations of Bhutanese will pay. A recent report from India documented severe impacts on water bodies and resources, forest and wildlife loss, and heavy pollution. The same report, reinforced by Bhutan’s own government statistics, notes that hydropower has failed to develop local capacity and employment, with most contracts going to Indian companies.
According to the IMF, Bhutan’s government debt now stands at a whopping 118% of GDP up from just 67% six years ago, with India by far the largest creditor, accounting for 64% of Bhutan’s total debt. By comparison, India’s ratio of government debt to GDP is 70% and China’s is 46%. Why does that ratio matter? Because it’s used by investors to measure a country’s ability to make future payments on its debt, thus affecting the country borrowing costs. Higher borrowing costs worsen debt further.

A recent British report on global debt lists Bhutan as one “among 14 other countries that are fast heading towards a debt crisis.” The report details hydropower’s rapid loss of economic viability, and concludes: “Should the hydropower sector’s financial performance continue to deteriorate, Bhutan’s solvency could be threatened.”
How convenient will that be for India? And what conditions will it attach to bailouts and pleas for loan forgiveness?
In this day and age, sovereignty and independence are much more likely undermined by economic than political control, albeit in far more subtle and hidden ways. So, the definition of “bullying” these days must go far beyond the old-fashioned geopolitical border disputes, however minor and insignificant, that still make for good press in TV images of jostling Chinese and Indian soldiers.

Time to ask hard questions – that can’t be publicly asked in Bhutan!

It’s time, if not long overdue, to question how benign India’s intentions are in Bhutan. How much “cooperation” is actually “exploitation” and “domination? And, how much of India’s foreign aid to Bhutan (now nearly $US1 billion a year) actually signifies mounting control and interference on one side and growing dependence and erosion of sovereignty on the other?

But of course, with Indian control of Bhutanese expression and politics, those questions will never be asked in Bhutan’s supposed free “democracy”. Just imagine if Bhutan’s daily Kuensel newspaper or its state-run Bhutan Broadcasting Service radio and television dared to publish this article. Unimaginable! How ironic that India, the world’s largest democracy that prides itself on its own free speech, utterly suppresses it in its “friendly neighbour”.
And here’s another question equally impossible to ask: How might it benefit Bhutan to warm up a bit more to China, and even to establish diplomatic relations with its huge northern neighbour, cooperate economically, and welcome selective Chinese aid and investments in Bhutan’s infrastructure?
After all, our connection with China already goes far beyond the political and economic to a deep cultural and spiritual affinity. For example, Bhutan shares directly with China the profound wisdom, texts and traditions of Mahayana Buddhism. China today is experiencing an unprecedented Buddhist revival that creates a natural and intuitive bond with Bhutan.

In fact, Bhutan is already benefitting directly from the resurgence of Buddhism in China. From one end of Bhutan to the other, from the giant Shakyamuni Buddha statue at Kuensel Phodrang in Thimphu to the giant Guru Rinpoche statue at Takila in Lhuentse, monasteries, temples, ceremonies and rituals are maintained, sponsored and supported through Chinese donations and contributions.

For all the fawning gratitude, praise, and adulation Bhutanese officials regularly heap on India for its “special relations” with Bhutan, what word of acknowledgement or appreciation do these officials ever utter for the steady, quiet Chinese support for our precious Bhutanese culture and traditions? Support, incidentally, that comes with “no strings attached” and no crippling debt burden!!

And this shared culture and tradition is a major reason for the surge in Chinese tourists flocking to Bhutan, now greatly outnumbering tourists from any other country. And while the Chinese all pay top dollar on expensive tourist visas to visit Bhutan, thus making China by far the largest contributor to Bhutan’s tourism industry, Indian visitors come for free, requiring no visa of any kind. Sorry to say this, but ask any hotel owner in the country who their least favourite, least respectful and most troublesome guests are, and they unfailingly say “Indians”.

The Prime Minister of Bhutan has agreed with India and promised to sign the South Asian Motor Vehicles Agreement (MVA). This would open up Bhutan to cars from India, Nepal and Bangladesh; further strengthening India’s hold on Bhutan. Just imagine Bhutan’s roads filled with Indian cars, taxis, buses and trucks. Indian tourists would come in busloads, totally over running Bhutan’s carefully planned ‘quality of quantity’ tourism policy that has helped protect Bhutan. Indian presence would increase, Bhutan’s roads would be destroyed by the increased traffic, resulting in more DANTAK presence to come ‘repair and maintain’ the roads, our pristine environment would be destroyed. It is interesting to note that the Prime Minister of Bhutan has agreed to sign this agreement, even if the National Assembly of Bhutan has voted against it. Showing how he is willing to do whatever the Indians want.
And despite the absence of diplomatic relations, Bhutan’s commercial relations with China are already quietly flourishing beneath the surface – all the way from yak-herders on Bhutan’s northern borders to Thimphu merchants dependent on Chinese imports, whose quality often far exceeds comparable Indian products.

In short, might Bhutan benefit in more ways than one by slipping away from total domination by one of its neighbours and instead strategically playing off and leveraging China-India competition to its own advantage?
But questions (let alone policies and solutions) like these are an unwritten “no go zone” in Bhutanese politics and media. Indeed, it is a telling mark of the sinister extent and penetration of Indian control and subjugation of Bhutan that no politician or journalist dare touch such questions with a ten-foot pole.

Interestingly, India is unwittingly aided in such suppression of free speech and other human rights by the utter failure of western human rights groups even to notice. Rather the west seems intent on drawing attention to human rights violations in countries like China, which has grown so rapidly into an economic powerhouse that its global reach now threatens western interests. Conveniently for India, it poses no such threat and escapes western scrutiny.

Yes, China may occasionally though very rarely “flex its muscles” in minor border disputes, as India accuses. But compared to Bhutan’s actual ground-level experience and interaction with China, isn’t India’s domination and subjugation of Bhutan far more intrusive, pervasive and insidious, extending into every portion of Bhutan’s social, political and economic fabric?

Policy/Economy,ACCOUNTABILITY: This is what is wrong with Indian bureaucracy and our Brown Lords.,86,69jpql,therollingindian,29,"If you are an Indian, it would be an astronomically impossible odd that you didn’t hear of how corrupt our bureaucracy is or how some **‘babu‘** or some **‘bade sahab‘** is corrupt and nothing more than a public disgrace. **That’s Indian bureaucracy for you.**

The real problem with bureaucrats is not just about caste and reservation. It is about accountability and responsibility. The pay structure of our Bureaucracy is such that officers get little salaries and large perks and amenities in form of bungalows and servants. In many cases, they occupy the same bungalows that the British left in 1947. And they do not do their job responsibly.

Fair disclosure that *I do understand and acknowledge the fact not all bureaucrats are corrupt. In fact, we have exemplary civil servants that have served as an inspiration to us all.* But this post is not about them, those honest civil servants. This is about what is wrong with Indian bureaucracy. The problem is not about the political issue or power struggles, but about an entire class of bureaucrats who are egoistic, arrogant, inhumane, corrupt and muddled with skulduggery.

**Bureaucrats, Bureaucracy, and Bureaucratic Measures** are now modern day derogatory overtones that express tyranny, arrogance and debilitation in our country’s governance. Bureaucrats are, in this day and age, perceived as those with massive egos and false nationalist zealotry. They are in essence a rule-bound bookkeepers who have ‘I’ mentality when it comes to interpreting rules. They play favorites, they are biased, they stay vague so that they are not held accountable, and they maintain chaos so that no one can see them cheat.

**From Outside: Looking In**

Don’t take my word for it. *I am just an ordinary Indian citizen exercising my freedom of speech.* Wouldn’t it help if you could see our Indian bureaucracy from an outside view? It is said that an unbiased opinion comes from the uninvolved. So let’s do that. Let’s see what others think of Indian bureaucracy.

In October 2010, just after the conclusion of Commonwealth Games in India, Eric Ellis wrote a post titled ‘A most uncivil service‘ on The Age where he talks about the Indian bureaucracy. Unfortunately, he has nothing good to say. He writes the following –

>""The Delhi games showed the world just what can be done when it's daunting civil service takes control – and the result wasn’t pretty. Corruption, waste, inefficiency, obfuscation and a cancerous lack of accountability in officialdom – and all of it on an Olympian scale.

>Delhi’s dramas may have been revealing for observers who briefly touch India but sadly these are the common issues daily confronting and long bedeviling a billion Indians and the foreign investors urged to invest their money in business there. Some economists have calculated that India’s bureaucratic inefficiency costs the country 1 to 2 points in annual growth.

>India’s daunting civil service is supposed to be the pride of the nation – just ask its privileged nabobs – but instead its malfunction and misgovernance hold India back. Enter any average government office in India and one is struck by the mountains of yellowing paperwork, years of filing and unfinished work ground down by the sheer scale of chaotic India’s myriad issues that overwhelm.""


Another account by Lant Pritchett of Harvard University sheds some brighter light on the Indian bureaucratic problem. In a paper, in 2009, titled “Is India a Failing State?“, he described Indian bureaucracy to be one of the most serious problems in the world today; up there with AIDS and climate change. He makes a point that foreign investments, and any welfare schemes in India for that matter, will never improve India’s economy as long as there is an inefficient Indian bureaucracy. These bureaucrats are like a tumorous growth that eat away any welfare funds like a parasite.

In his book “The Foundation Pillars for Change: Our Nation, Our Democracy & Our Future”, **Mr. V.K. Patel** writes that *most developmental spending fails to reach its intended recipients. It is either diverted or misused by a sizeable and a complacent bureaucracy.* I corroborate to Mr. Patel’s description of bureaucracy.

*We need to take away these IAS’s comfortable life devoid of any accountability for their country. Take away their big bungalows, their VIP status, their guards, their peons, their orderlies and hook them up to a system where they are rewarded for their good acts and punished for their bad deeds. Unless and until such an overhaul happens, India is not going to be a great country. No welfare policies will ever come to fruition. India cannot change without a change in our bureaucratic system. This is what is wrong with the Indian bureaucracy.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/69jpql/accountability_this_is_what_is_wrong_with_indian/

* Growth in rural wages has been curtailed. This ensures that the reserve army of the underemployed continues to exert a downward pressure on wages.
* The ruling party’s ideology of religious nationalism has the merit of distracting the attention of the masses waiting impatiently for the fruits of development to trickle down. The hard work put in by the ruling party’s grassroots organizations has done much to steer away the poorer castes and classes from militant demands that interfere with the process of capital accumulation. As the Roman satirist Juvenal said, it is necessary to provide both bread and circuses to the masses.
* The presence of a strong charismatic leader is a big help in developing an anti-liberal mass base and ensuring right-wing policies are implemented. The government has done its best to neutralize the left wing and has placed its nominees in crucial positions in important institutions. Recall that all the East Asian miracle economies had their growth spurts under autocratic governments.

Policy/Economy,[NP] Rant against GST!,26,6xsjmc,_Overly_Optimistic,21,"Hello fellow randians! 

This might be a long rant but I think it might be affecting a lot of us here. Earlier, i.e. pre GST most restaurants and online food ordering places had their menus adjusted to whatever taxes they paid earlier and had figures like 199/299/500 etc. inclusive of all taxes. The breakup between the service and the tax used to be shown in the bill and didn't matter much as the bill was what I knew I was paying. 

Now in comes GST! The grand scheme supposed to propel the Indian economy to nobody knows what heights. :| 

Most restaurants and online places here in Bangalore just shamelessly add GST to the final bill and the justification is that it's mandatory. Now, I know it's mandatory for them, but what about the food prices? Practically none have adjusted their prices to take out the tax component that used to be added before. Case in point here is freshmenu. Great food, great service everything but then this. Had been noticing this since some time but just can't keep it in anymore.

Not just food, malls etc. now show the price without the GST so you're in for a rude shock when the cashier tells you the final amount. Didn't used to be the same amount earlier either but now it's way more than what you'd have thought.

I used to admire the current government a lot. Liked the statesman Modi used to appear. Still respect him for the foreign policy that seems to be going in the right direction. But at the end of the day/month I do have to take a look at my wallet. And frankly, I've been let down. Can't be too enthusiastic about a government that's continually taking steps to rip me of my money. I pay all my taxes regularly and do so happily, knowing that it'll be used for the nation, but to what extent do I keep paying up? 

The previous government used to be in news for various scams and the level of corruption used to be mind-boggling. But sorry to say, it never directly affected me or most of my acquaintances. I'm in no way justifying them, but at least they let the middle class grow independently. This government seems to be hell bent on killing it. And it's all done legally, so no one can really say anything. 

I'll go on a limb to say that the middle class consumption was driving the economic growth in this country since the last 15 years and with the measures that the govt is taking they're sure to kill it by making the middle class more conservative with their spending.

**RBI Drops Rates Like They’re Hot**

After four interest rate decreases in the past one year, the Reserve Bank of India cut interest rates by 0.25% again to a more than [5-year](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-repo-rates-decision-idINKCN0X20C1) low of 6.5%. This is the rate at which banks can borrow money from the RBI. What does it mean for you? One, loans of all kind might get cheaper. Two, investors in debt funds and tax-free bonds might make more money. Three, fixed deposit rates might get lower. Four, you’ll definitely see some self-proclaimed analysts on the TV bickering about this. The central bank also, unexpectedly, increased the reverse REPO rate by 0.25% to 6%. That’s the rate at which banks lend money to the RBI. The central bank’s main mission now is to ensure banks lower rates as well - now that banks can borrow for cheap, to ensure that they also lend for cheap - to boost the economy.


**Bihar Pulls A Gujarat - Bans Alcohol**

Heartbroken Romantics all across Bihar now have one more reason to cry - that bottle of whiskey in their hands right now might as well be the last bottle of whiskey in their hands ever. The state has decided to go the route of Gujarat, Nagaland and Manipur to completely ban all sales of [alcohol](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/indian-state-bihar-imposes-total-ban-on-alcohol-sales) (you didn’t know it was banned in Nagaland and Manipur as well, did you?). The move is expected to cost the state about ₹4,000 crore in loss of revenue from taxes on alcohol, and much more from businesses like bars and alcohol retailers shutting down and firing their employees. It’s payday for alcohol retailers in Jharkhand, the neighbouring state, as a move like this will increase sales of alcohol meant to be smuggled across state lines into Bihar to be illegally sold for higher prices. Shares of United Spirits ([MCDOWELL-N](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AMCDOWELL-N&ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), the country’s largest alcohol producer, were down 5% on the news - although that might just be because it’s a Vijay Mallya company.

**One Bank’s Trash Is Another ARC’s Treasure**

Indian banks have accumulated a staggering amount of bad loans - 11% of all loans are now at a risk of defaulting. And banks can’t run away from these bad loans fast enough. In come the ARCs - Asset Reconstruction Companies - that buy all the bad loans from the banks at dirt cheap prices. Banks are happy because at least they made some money from the loans. ARCs are happy because they just bought loans for pennies on the dollar (or paisas on the rupee) - and now they only need a few of those loans to not default to make huge profits. At least that’s the fantasy. Multiple global ARCs are [setting](http://www.businessinsider.in/Distressed-debt-buyers-are-sensing-an-opportunity-in-India-as-bad-loans-pile-up/articleshow/51694980.cms) up shop in India in hopes of being able to buy these bad loans from Indian banks. Are they the kryptonite to India’s bad loans crisis? Are they the white knights that will save India’s banks-in-distress? Only time will tell.

**Are Diamonds Forever?**

That’s the question the government is asking itself as it prepares to end its legal monopoly over diamond mining in India. After the first ever auction of a gold mine in February, which was won by Vedanta Ltd. ([VEDL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AVEDL&ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), India is gearing up to do the same again and auction its first [ever](http://www.vccircle.com/news/infrastructure/2016/04/05/after-gold-india-set-its-first-diamond-mine-auction) diamond mine. The mine to be auctioned, located in Madhya Pradesh, is India’s only operational diamond mine and is valued at an estimated ₹106 crore. Global mining company Rio Tinto is one of the interested bidders. These auctions of new mines and minerals are being seen as a new form of privatization and disinvestment by the government. The auction of coal mines gave us the infamous Coalgate scam. Let’s hope the word ‘diamondgate’ continues to just mean a diamond-studded gate.

**Hot, New Scandal: The Panama Papers**

In Indian middle-class folklore, a Swiss bank account either means that you’ve finally made it big or that you’re a politician/builder. But a Swiss bank account is no longer the most lucrative way to hide your money. Rather, an offshore company in Panama is now the new Swiss bank account. Leaked data sizing up to 2.6 TB (Yes, terabytes, you read that right the first time) from a law firm in Panama that helped set up these offshore companies has [revealed](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/panama-papers-list-amitabh-bachchan-kp-singh-aishwarya-rai-iqbal-mirchi-adani-brother/) a list of rich and famous individuals around the world that own offshore companies in Panama, including more than 500 Indians like members of the Bachchan clan - Amitabh and Aishwarya. The global list includes the presidents of Ukraine and Argentina, Prime Ministers of Iceland and Pakistan, the King of Saudi Arabia and close friends of Vladimir Putin. Iceland’s PM has already been forced to resign due to the scandal. To be fair, tax evasion is not the only purpose of offshore companies - there are a lot of legitimate reasons for one to have an offshore company in Panama as well. For Amitabh Bachchan though, this just negates all the good PR that the *do boond zindagi ke* polio campaign brought him. As for you, see if you can even point to where Panama is on a globe.

This means that govt employees (babus, netas, teachers, judges, diplomats) get payed a piss poor amount. Perfect incentive for corruption. Singapore pays their govt employees extremely well and have almost no corruption because there's no need to be corrupt (cause they are already rich).

We know through stats that around 2050-60, the population the country will fall down, and with an estimated 2-digit trillion economy, we will see the rise of the GDP per capita.

This is all WITH the current TFR (It is at a replacement rate). Now we change some data shall we? The goverment decides that from tomorrow, would apply mandatory childless policies. It's illegal to procreate and people would need to adopt children if they want to be, you know, parents. Amazing! Orphans would get new homes and they are really happy (Let us assume, they law is perfectly enforced).

The TFR would fall down below the replacement rate, ensuring population WILL fall down. However, there's this problem: We have a lot old people, and the thing is *they can't work*. Especially a country like India, where there is huge population and on top of that: *a huge old population*. How are we going to give them pensions? Government would *spend* more than *gain* more? An old poor population isn't a very good incentive for FDI either. How are we going to tackle the massive grey population we have?

Policy/Economy,"Why Rao is considered so Chankyan, a brief into into the 91 reforms",126,3lnf6a,RajaRajaC,109,"The narrative about our BOP crisis today largely seems to be, India was almost bankrupt (true), IMF handed MMS (and Rao) a list of reforms, reforms passed, huzzzah!

The reality is very very different from this narrative. In reality, PVN had these massive issues to overcome,

* A minority govt
* A very partisan opposition (even more so than today). Atleast today the plank is supposedly 'development', back then it was all about ""garibi hatao"", ""support our PSU's to the death"". 
* Look at the seat strength the opposition had - JD+CPI held 102 seats, the BJP 120. These two combined alone could defeat any motion.

If you think the UPA had it tough, and the NDA has it tough today...think again. PVn had a minority govt, had to hardsell 'reforms' which were a very very dirty word back then, had to fight deeply vested interests. If we are a crony capitalist state today, in 1990, it was pretty much open house. Rules and policies were made by the Dhirubhai's.

How did he do all this? Read on,

To be fair to Rao, he was not a great economist, heck he was barely an economist, but he played the political game very well. He for instance put forth the idea of liberalising a very vocal sector (say mines), and then promptly backtrack (As though he was surrendering) and putting in its place a more...milder reform.

Look at how...spectacularly he played the New Industrial Policy of 91. It was a breathtaking move (for India) in that it virtually did away with Nehruvian era relics of licensing and control for industries. It could have boomeranged on him, so what does the sly fox do? Announce it the exact same day (At around 4 PM, to ensure it made the next days print news) of the budget for 91.

What did it look like? Mr MMS passed this reform. If it did boomerang? Who could be sacrificed? FUCK! I mean, you look at all this and you have to admire the sheer political statecraft of this wily old fox.

Look at broadly how well he handled this whole reform process? He first announced a broad slew of measures (to shut the IMF up), and then promptly delayed the introduction of bills or overall went very slow in actually bringing these into action. And then the rolling thunder movement, hit one broad policy front with mild reforms. Wait for fall out, quell it (with outright bribery if needed) and introduce a marginally more...powerful reform. On and on it went.

One thing he never did was pick a battle he knew he would lose. So he never went after the big PSU's, never the big vested interests, never the farm or social welfare schemes. He brilliantly picked the battles he knew he would win. He admired Willy Brandt and modelled himself on this other wily old fox.

The final piece of the puzzle! Despite being a politician, he never openly spoke about the reforms nor his overall aims. This kept everybody guessing and confused and he basically was free to do as he wished.  I think his brilliance can be explained simply by saying something he used to say often ""delaying or not taking a decision in itself was a decision"". This is most evident in the way he handled (again, quite spectacularly) the Fertilizer crisis. He had to reduce the fertilizer subsidies, but it was (and still is) a political hot potato. So what does the fox do? Again, push it via MMS, and when the shit storm hit, MMS ""offered his resignation"" which the fox graciously refused, AND then he sets up a committe, which mollifies the protestors, and then he passes the reforms with a 10% cut from the original increase.

I mean, this level of political guile and statecraft is just astonishing.

It is a fucking pity he didn't have a govt with absolute majority in the LS or that he didn't get a second term (sadly he was a Gandhi loyalist to a fault). If he had...

Not even touching the deft political moves, I mean this guy played all spectrums like it was a violin. Left? Check (V P Singh's faves, Montek Singh & Rakesh Mohan were his key advisors). BJP? Check. There is always this dark speculation though that he allowed Babri Masjid to be taken down, with the trade off that the BJP support his reforms, but this is and will remain unfounded speculation. He really was a supreme political master, and without him, not a single reform would have been passed.

I must point out, was he some sort of angel or something? No. He maybe was personally corrupt (we don't know), he associated with, nay was intimately associated with a deep rat bastard like Chandraswami. PVN had his flaws, but that shouldn't take away from his monumental achievements.

Why was the 91 budget so...landmark? Here are some top reasons why,

* Rupee was devalued, and devalued again.
* New trade policy favouring exporters (a bad word in the maai-baap socialistic model of Indira and Rajiv...not Nehru)
* Dismantled the license raj
* Put forth an austerity budget (before it was cool) and aimed straight away to cut deficit by 3-4% points.
* He near abolished export subsidies

Policy/Economy,"Now that Raghuram Rajan is leaving, let's talk about his replacement: The Monetary Policy Committee",150,4osapv,kumbhakaran,40,"#Exit Raghuram Rajan, Enter Monetary Policy Committee

Now that Raghuram Rajan has resigned, ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) of his own free will of course ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), it’s time to talk about his successor: The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). You heard that right, a whole committee is set to replace him soon enough.

The media, at the moment, is filled with people sitting in two camps. One is mourning the loss of a great visionary central banker who was putting the ‘[sex back in the sensex](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-09-13/news/42041678_1_raghuram-rajan-rbi-guv-duvvuri-subbarao)’, while the other is excitedly discussing who is going to replace Rajan. 

> “Is it going to be Subramanian Swamy? That wily little fox has been planning it all along!”

> “Is it going to be Pahlaj Nihlani? He makes so many interesting cuts, probably he’ll be good at cutting interests too!”

> “Is it going to be Arundhati Bhattacharya? The first *woman* RBI chairman! That would sell, boyz, that would sell well indeed!”

> “Is it going to be Tanmay Bhat? He can then announce interest rate cuts over Snapchat. He’ll snap the economy in the Bhat and bring it back to shape!”

But what our dear media and ‘experts’ don’t seem to be talking about is the real replacement, the change of epic proportions that is going to happen to our central bank. So I present to you, the **Monetary Policy Committee**.

Don’t take *my* word for how important this is. RR makes a sly mention to this & the NPA problem in his [farewell letter](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=37259) too. All in one breath, squeezed between cryptic messages of being ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) forced to resign ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) as Governor of RBI.

> Inflation is in the target zone, **but the monetary policy committee that will set policy has yet to be formed**. Moreover, the bank clean up initiated under **the Asset Quality Review**, having already brought more credibility to bank balance sheets, **is still ongoing**. International developments also pose some risks in the short term.

___
#OK. RR is sexy and all. But n00b question: *What* does an RBI Governor do exactly?
___

Before we start talking about the big change, we should talk a little about what the job of the Reserve Bank of India Governor is. It would make it easier to explain the transition from Governor to MPC.

*(Check out /u/ribiy's comment: https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4osapv/now_that_raghuram_rajan_is_leaving_lets_talk/d4f7ll5. He explains this part more lucidly.)*

Think of the RBI as a big bank that lends to other smaller banks, those banks in turn lend to you. Commercial Banks *also* get their own money (through deposits) etc and then lend it to people (Thank you /u/MyselfWalrus). The Governor takes a call on what interest rate the RBI will charge to the banks they are lending to. In turn, those banks would add a tiny percentage of their own to that interest and give loans to people like you & me. The difference of interest rates between deposits & lending is where the banks make the profits, the central bank keeps control over how cheap or expensive loans in the market will be. The governor also sets the *Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)* for banks. That’s basically the amount of securities (Gold, bonds, assets) banks need to have to disburse loans of a proportional amount.

Apart from setting interest rates, he also is a sort of a Bank Manager. He keeps the machine running smoothly, so to speak. He also decides how much money is to be printed in what denominations. The Governor also gets to put his supercool signature on currency notes. He makes sure the cheques get cleared, fair exchange of funds happens between banks and basically keeps a watch on the banking sector through regular audits. 

The Governor is incharge of maintaining order in the foreign exchange market and making sure the country is working towards the goals set by the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA). He also has the power to issue directions to banks, the recent one where he ordered a cleanup of balance sheets and declare Non-Performing Assets (NPAs). This is the **Asset Quality Review** that he mentioned in his farethewell letter as well. (Details about the NPA problem can be [read here](http://www.policypeepul.com/blog/2016/5/11/we-need-to-talk-about-our-banks))

Basically, the RBI governor gets to control how much money is floating around in the market. By increasing/decreasing interest rates, he can control spending within the market and feel like a finance god. The one single job of the RBI Governor over the past few years is to resist the pressure of successive governments & reduce interest rates too much. 

Or, at least, that is the part of his job that gets him in the news.

___
#OK. So the RBI Governor is an epic Finance God that gets to screw the government over, right? RIGHT?
___
Hey now! That’s harsh!

The Governor actually has a job of ensuring economic stability. He/she (‘she’ because now that’s possible!) is supposed to think long-term, ensure that the citizens don’t go on an insane spending spree and create artificial financial bubbles that will burst later and bite ‘em in the a. (Eg: The 2008 Housing Mortgage crisis in the US)

The Government, on the other hand, is a creature with a life of 5 years. In those five years, they are desperately trying to woo the voters and get them to vote for the same political party in the next election. What would make people happier than having more money to spend, ergo cheaper and more accessible loans! 

The government of the day will keep asking the RBI Governor to lower interest rates so that there is more money flooded in the market (""Bubbles? What bubbles? We'll deal with them *if* they burst""). The RBI Governor refuses most of the time because propping up an economy on the shoulders of a creature called ‘debt’ is… well… a TERRIBLE idea.

*Well, whatdoyaknow, that’s all about to change!*

___
#Alrighty then! Tell me about the big ‘change’.
___
[The Finance Bill, 2016](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2016-17/fb/bill.pdf), which was passed in the last budget session of Parliament, had a [controversial amendment to the FCRA act \(Clause 233\)](http://www.policypeepul.com/blog/2016/5/11/last-week-in-parliament) that allowed foreign funding to political parties. But but but, it had another amendment to the Reserve Bank of India Act (Clauses 216 to 220), which created this entity called the “Monetary Policy Committee”.

Earlier, the Governor was the whole & sole authority to decide interest rates. He could veto anything that he thought doesn’t benefit the Indian economy. It was a dictatorship and there was no way around it. Now, the MPC will be the one setting rates and making fiscal policies for the country.

The MPC will have six members, three from the RBI and three ‘eminent personalities’ appointed by the central government. The RBI peeps will consist of the Governor (Chairman), Deputy Governor & one officer nominated by the RBI central board. The 3 ‘personalities’ will be selected for a period of four years by [the following people](http://imgur.com/2ZTbQRm). 

Each member gets one vote. If there is a tie, [the RBI Governor gets the casting vote](http://imgur.com/xJT8Hi8).

Every member has to give a written statement explaining why they voted in favour/against a resolution. However, all proceedings of the Monetary Policy Committee [shall remain confidential](http://imgur.com/NtBtUkW).

These are the *bare bone facts* that I have presented to you. You can interpret it in whatever way you want. I am going to go ahead and give my take on it.

____
#Democratic way of functioning
___

Most global banks have this process of having a committee to decide rate and monetary policies. In the US, the Federal Open Market Committee has seven board members, all of whom are appointed by the President for a period of 14 years. In England, the MPC has nine members (5 from the Bank of England and 4 appointed by the Minister of Finance).

In India, the debate for forming an MPC began in February 2014. The RBI, back then, recommended that this committee should have Five members (Three from RBI and Two Government appointed). In 2015, the Government recommended that the committee should have Seven members (Four Govt. appointed and Three from the RBI). After much haggling and powerplay, they seem to have reached a compromise with equal number of members from both sides. 

Jaitley mentioned in the Lok Sabha during the Finance Bill 2016 debate that this MPC was formed in consultation with the RBI, so itsallgood. 

**Or is it?**

Earlier the Governor was incharge of making the right call. He was solely responsible for any bad decisions that he takes and the economy suffers as a result. So it also meant that the Governor was that much careful before lowering interest rates or taking any major steps. Now, there’s a committee in place, the responsibility of the decisions taken would be *diluted* between six people. ([Shared Responsibility](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/collective-responsibility/))

Let’s assume a scenario where there is a resolution in place to lower the interest rate. Three people (government appointees) vote in favour and the other three (RBI appointees including the Governor) vote against. It's a tie. Now the governor gets a casting vote. Logically, the governor would vote against, keeping in line with his first vote.

But what if he/she decides to vote in favour? What would that exactly mean, in terms of attributing responsibility for making bad decisions? There is always the factor that the new governor would be someone who totally favors the Government and takes decisions based on only their recommendations. 

Or worse, takes decisions to *be in the favour* of the Government.

- The composition has since been changed to the present version.

- You can't have a Nihlani or Sharma as the govt nominees because the Committee also mentions the selection process for these people. It will be done by an external panel which includes the RBI Governor.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4osapv/now_that_raghuram_rajan_is_leaving_lets_talk/

>Today we see that even when the issue of ecology is being discussed in details for past many decades, **yet we find that with each passing day the ecological destruction is approaching much faster and closer to us.** Because of this environmental destruction, the world is facing newer and deadlier natural calamities consistently. But except for some changes in their vocabulary or some half hearted attempts at symptomatic treatment, no meaningful change is visible in the policies of nations and large multinational companies.

Good, raises the issue of environmental conversation. As we have seen in Uttarakhand, Pune Landslide and several other natural calamities, damaging the environment can be catastrophic. Hopefully, the government is listening. I am worried because it doesn't seem to be listening. Context: http://qz.com/255772/the-11-environmental-disasters-narendra-modi-blessed-in-his-first-100-days/

>In the history of past one thousand years, Bharat has been the only example which has made genuine efforts in this direction through the path of truth and non-violence. ... Neither any questions are raised against one’s faith being different, **nor campaigns are run to destroy other idols of worship**, **nor there is a tradition of raising disputes over the validity or respectability of other’s faith on the basis of systems restricted by the dictates of a book.**

Really? Babri, Kandhamahal happened in Pakistan? Furthermore, his arguments are directed towards Abrahamic religions since they follow a central book. However, the Dharmic religions in India are not immune from religious dogmatism.

>With similar expectations in mind, few months ago, the people of Bharat brought about a drastic change in the government. **This change of government is not even six months old. But positive signs are emanating from time to time** which give hope about emergence of Bharat on the international horizon and it appears that the people’s desire of a life, secure and progressing in all its aspects, will soon start reflecting in the governance. In a very short period, some policy initiatives taken by the central government in national interest on the fronts of economy, national security, international relations and many other areas have raised good hopes.

I was told that this was a non-political event. Why he is praising the BJP government here? 

>The new policy makers should also take best advantage of the vision and experience of **great Bharatiya leaders** right from the tradition of Swamy Vivekananda, Yogi Arvind, Swamy Ramtirth, Gurudev Ravindra Nath Thakur and Lokmanya Tilak to Mahatma Gandhi, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Swatantrya Veer Savarkar, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Acharya Vinoba Bhave, Second Sarsanghachalak of RSS Shri ‘Guruji’ aka Madhav Sadashiv Golvalkar,  Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia, Jayprakash Narayan and Pt. Deendayal Upadhyay. 

Notice how not even a single Muslim is named. How about people like Abdul Kalam Azad? Again ties in with their ideology. 

>There is a serious **upsurge in the jehadi activities in the southern parts of Bharat**, especially in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. No effective policy imperatives, efforts are visible in curbing such activities. ... Near surrender before these fanatic elements and appeasement policy adopted by the ruling parties in these states, **have put the life of local Hindu communities, the law and order situation as well as the national security under serious threat in the region**. 

Really, the Hindus and their way of life is under threat in Tamil Nadu and Kerala? Or does the RSS chief subtly want to hint at the rising Muslim population in these states and and wants to tie that to rising terrorism in the state. 

>Though an alert, transparent, sensitive and a rule abiding administration is necessary for ending exploitation and ensuring development, equally important is the role of society in eradicating exploitation of the poor through active cooperation, striving in a democratic way to end their exploitation and by running various types of help and support activities in order to take these fruits of development to the deprived people. **We feel it necessary to put a ban on meat exports, beef in particular and cow smuggling in immediate future.**

I was completely with him till the last sentence. How is a ban on meat exports, **beef in particular**, going to help the poor in India? Will it not just eradicate one source of income? 

>Each one of us must test each of our act, whether big or small, on the simple ground that each member of **my great Hindu society**, and each son/daughter of Mother Bharat, is my own brother and sister. We must ensure that **each of our Hindu temple, cremation ground and community water source must remain open to all Hindus**. We should ensure that all Hindus should participate in all functions, celebrations as well as festivals of great heroes and personalities.

So much for the RSS being a national entity, or are non-Hindus anti-national?

>Since its inception, Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh has been engaged in the great mission of building a work force of such swayamsewaks, who are energized with the **pride of their national Hindu identity**; are empowered by inculcating great qualities in their personality; and are prepared to sacrifice everything even their life for the great goal as a constituent of dedicated and disciplined organisation.

Just a little more Hindutva.

The entire speech is very political in nature, it has nothing to do with Vijay Dashami. He is pushing for an India that reflects the RSS' vision, and I find that deeply disturbing.

AskIndia,Need feedback for Insurance Policy that I took. (x-post AskIndia),1,1s57oi,dhavalcoholic,1,"**Re-posting here because of lack of activity in /r/AskIndia**

Hello,

Last year I took a Term policy from ICICI Prudential. I took this policy with the intention of ""Insurance"" rather than ""Investment"".

So as per this policy: 1) I will be paying Rs. 14000~ for 30 years. The Sum Assured is Rs. 325000.

2) At the end of Premium Paying term, company will pay Sum Assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

3) If I die within Premium paying term (30 yrs), company will pay ""twice"" the Sum assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

4) If I die after the Premium paying term or if I turn 100, company will pay the Sum assured (without revisionary and bonuses).

Questions:

1) The Sum assured is less than the total premium I ll pay. Is it normal for a Term policy?

2) If I die during Premium paying term, are the returns sufficient in comparison to the amount I pay?

3) Points 4 and 2 seems to be confusing. Are they going to pay me twice?

Please help clarify, as this is my first policy. :)

AskIndia,"Ambassador of India takes back my newly issued OCI card, suggests a pay for and fill out new application. Please advise.",14,bdfid1,FrustratedOCIHopeful,27,"Hello /AskIndia!  First time poster, long time lurker here.

&#x200B;

Brief background: My wife is Indian and I am Canadian, and we have been so excited to finally visit her family in India this summer. I applied for the OCI 11 months ago per her request to make it happen. The application never went smooth, but that was never expected, as goes this story for most OCI applicants. We properly submitted all our documents, and each month like clockwork, we receive additional requests from the Indian Embassy for ""extra"" documents that weren't requisites on the OCI application checklist. We happily oblige to all requests with exceptional punctuality, no questions, just documents. 11 months go by since we submitted everything, and finally we get notified that my OCI card was ready for pick up at the Indian Embassy. Just come with your passport so we can take fingerprints and you can be on your way to India!

We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds) . When we finally get to the Embassy, we sit down with our consulur,  who strangely didn't greet or make eye contact for the first few minutes of our meeting.  She hands me my OCI Card, its receipt, and asks my wife to sign document a declaring that she agrees to forfeit my OCI card to the Government of India in case of my death or divorce.

However, things got strange when the consular went on her computer and said that the electronic fingerprint software wouldn't open up specifically for my OCI file.  She stands up, picks up my passport and brand new OCI card, leaves her office to meet with the Embassy's  Ambassador and only returns with my Canadian passport, not my OCI. She said the Ambassador is in a bad mood and suggests that I  fill out and pay for new application.

Excuse me, what? I've never seen or met the ambassador. What is happening?

She explains that my OCI file number could not be retrieved in the system because the application was submitted in 2018, and because it's currently 2019, there were ""crossed wires"", thus resulting in their inability to take my fingerprints and give me my OCI.  My wife and I make the suggestion of taking physical ink fingerprints at the local police station and  bringing them back to the Embassy, so they can have a hard copy. She said that the ink fingerprint option is not possible and reiterates that the best solution, as per the advice of the ambassador who wasn't in a good mood, would be to fill out and pay for a new application. Back to square one, 11 months down the drain. We are confused, just drove 7 hours at her request to pick up this card only to tell us to our face that we can't have it and we need to start again.  We politely try to press her for more information, and the best option she has for us  was for her to email a request to her OCI contacts in India to try to resolve this by issuing a new file number and a new card, but not to be optimistic.

What is going on here? Any advice would be much appreciated.

I  should also add that I am Canadian living in Europe, a qualified  professional in ""interaction design"", educated, and don't have a criminal record.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bdfid1/ambassador_of_india_takes_back_my_newly_issued/

AskIndia,"What happened to the ""spiritual country"" that India used to be?",24,ai7392,fenocs,17,"So I do not know whether to put this in Ask India (because it is a question) or Reddiquette (because it is a discussion in and of itself). But I wanted to discuss this with someone, *anyone.*  

So ours is (used to be?) a spiritual country. Off the top of my head, I can recall at least 4 major religions that began here: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. Who knows, there are probably more that I don't know about. And at the core of these religions (irrespective of how the religions' followers have interpreted things) these religions are supposed to be about GOOD. About being nice, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving.  

The prevalent view in India about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are ""materialistic"" and we are somehow more ""spiritualistic"". I couldn't disagree more.  

Rather, I see the values and virtues of simple kindness, love, nicety, acceptance, love and certain other so-called ""spiritual"" virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in India. It is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism, sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west. Indians, meanwhile, are still dealing with the Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships. While kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs, or someone who has gay/lesbian parents, or someone who has anxiety issues or what-have-you; we in India are drumming up noise about what ""ancient India"" achieved in terms of scientific advances and how ""our Indian culture"" is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us.  

Now don't get me wrong here - I am NOT trying to say that ""the west is perfect and that all Indians are all dicks"" or anything like that. Indians (outside of the major metroes) are still some of the most kind and helpful people that I've met - so long as you don't discuss things that will piss them off e.g. religion, caste system etc. And yes, the west has a LONG way to go before they become all accepting, just look at the MAGA crowd and the whole feminist cult. But that having been said, I really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming ""evil"" day by day (ironically, while attempting to tell the world how ""good and virtuous our *ancient civilization* is"") while the one's we have *vilified* as the ""ignorant western people"" are slowly leaving us behind; much like the tortoise in the tortoise/hare story.  

Just a little something for everyone to think about on a regular Monday morning. Cheers.  

**EDIT:** And it is surprising that while so many WhatsApp forwards talk about how India had the best *""Vimanas""* (spacecrafts) or the best *""Brahmastras""* (weapons equivalent to a nuke); nobody, like LITERALLY NOT ONE SINGLE WHATSAPP ""FORWARD"" talks about how *humility, kindness, forgiveness, acceptance etc.* were the (supposed) virtues of people from that time period. Perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as ""cool"" enough by the people who forward these forwards? I dunno. But it fails me how having a *personal flying ship* is somehow more important than basic love and kindness towards one another.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ai7392/what_happened_to_the_spiritual_country_that_india/
AskIndia,Clueless American: Food Etiquette with our Indian Neighbors,54,bemcxg,JaJH,24,"I'd initially posted this to r/AskIndia and got some advice, but I was also directed to post this here too. My main goal is to avoid any inadvertent rudeness on our family's part. 

 

So we have some neighbors from India (we're in the U.S.) and they have a daughter around the same age as ours (preschool). The two girls have become good friends and play together several times a week. Whenever their daughter comes over to our house, she brings a snack with her, and politely declines anything we offer her while she's here (they're Catholic, and do not have any dietary restrictions from what they've told us) which is usually fruit or crackers, never junk food. Whenever our daughter goes over to their house, she ALWAYS comes back with food of some sort. Sometimes its a small snack, sometimes its something more elaborate. They've also brought us food on a couple occasions too (always delicious). We've had them over for a meal a few times, and they eat sparingly.

&#x200B;

My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. But I want to make sure we're not somehow being rude. Growing up, if I went over to a friend's house, their parents would give us snacks/drinks. Similarly, if friends came over to my house, my parents would offer food/drinks. But should we be sending our daughter over to their house with her own snack? When we cook something special, should we bring some to them?

I'm British and would like to learn more about Indian history, but most of the most prominent scholarship on the subject in the UK has come from non-Indian Brits, and often comes with particular biases (particularly regarding British colonialism). I'd therefore appreciate it if anyone can point me towards good written histories of the country by Indian scholars.

For the history of British colonialism in India I've started with Shashi Tharoor's *Inglorious Empire*, but of course there's a lot more to India's genesis than British imperialism.

AskIndia,European looking for opinions from Indians regarding how to make a difficult relationship work,28,968di3,PsychoPass1,67,"Namaste Redditors, (also posted to AskIndia but I am in need right now)

I am from Central Europe and in a 1.5year relationship with an Indian woman. Without going into too much detail, we are pretty sure that we fit very well together, but the problem is that she is from a very traditional family (arranged in-caste marriage) who she loves and is loved by.

Understandably, she does not want to 

1. Hurt her family's standings
2. Cause her family grief and pain
3. Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.

I can secure her a safe, free life (be it in India or in Europe) with a near-guarantee of a loving, supportive husband. 

I want to make this happen, but knowing that she would never hurt her family like that, meaning she will ultimately marry another guy, I feel conflicted as to whether this relationship should go on.

AskIndia,We really need to talk about Flairs.,109,6bacbg,root_su,133,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/
AskIndia,Who should I vote for in 2019 General Elections?,7,63l6vm,concernedindianguy,50,"Even though I was eligible to vote back in 2014, I was out-of-station during the elections and couldn't be back home in time to vote. I have never voted till now due to similar circumstances. 

Back when UPA I and II were in power, the obvious choice was BJP or its allies. But now that their true colours and agenda are out, my conscience wouldn't allow me to vote for them.

AAP is out of the question as Kejriwal has demonstrated his greed and hunger for power again and again. He keeps allying himself with all the wrong parties in order to protest against whichever the incumbent is.

I will never vote for INC until they change their top leadership and overhaul the party structure as a pro-development secular party with centrist policies.

Who do I vote for?

BJP will win in 2019 no matter what. I just don't want my vote to go to them. 

Are there any good candidate/parties that are not affiliated to the Sangh Parivar/RSS/VHP?

If this trend of right wing Nationalism continues, we'll turn into a Right Wing authoritarian Fascist pseudo-state. 

I wish to see India as an educated, liberal and inclusive country that keeps religion out of its government.

Initial 6 months was training period after which we would have been put into projects. However, I had to join a project within a month immediately after my joining. I joined a project with QA (manual testing) profile and worked there for 6 months. During that time, I realized that if I continue there, I wouldn't have too much growth into the future. I was also put into support work as well which means I was doing both testing and support work. I researched a lot, made up my mind and called it quits. I left using a medical reason and didn't go back to work.

After that, I joined a small company as a Jr. Java Developer as a fresher again and have been working there for 1.7 years. I have successfully transitioned from a testing profile to a developer one and gave one hell of a performance as well (as much as a fresher can give).

Now, I am thinking of a job-switch and I am confused as to whether include the 6 months spent at the previous company as work-experience or not? I don't have a relieving letter/experience letter from them. I do have an offer letter, joining confirmation and two random pay-slips from them. Do I put that experience in my resume and be honest to the next company about my past (this is what I am bending towards), or do I hide the experience and just show my current experience as the total experience? Moreover, If I decide to hide it, will it come up in a background check?

AskIndia,"So I am writing a book, titled ironically ""Letters from your BFF"" in response to Nikita Singh's ""Letters to my ex"".",2,9b5g5p,dharavsolanki,4,"Hey everyone, I have flaired the post AskIndia, because I am seeking a conversation about absurdities of relationships and interpersonal friendships in today's world. 

Would love to hear from you guys. My notes on the original book are given below. Looking forward to your comments and suggestions and experiences and anything else you feel like talking about based on the summary/notes of the book I have provided below...

-------

""Letters To My Ex"" is a book by Nikita Singh, about a girl who runs away from her own engagement ceremony. She was supposed to be engaged and married to her own long time boyfriend but yet, she just freaked out and run away. She does not talk to anyone after that, and ten months in, she confesses to the boyfriend that she still loves him and makes him swear that he will do everything to earn her trust everyday henceforth.

I think it is a slightly less intellectual equivalent of ""Notes From The Underground"" (Men are Not Piano Keys) fame. The format is the same. Notes from the underground has notes, letters has letters. They are both viciously funny and about characters that are absolutely abominable.

Anyways, I started out writing my own response to the girl from the book and plan to publish it as a book of my own introducing concepts from neuroscience and philosophy and conflict resolution and the likes.

The original book is located here: 

https://www.amazon.in/Letters-My-Ex-Nikita-Singh-ebook/dp/B07938VDLS/ref=sr_1_2_twi_kin_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1535473766&sr=1-2&keywords=letters+to+my+ex

-----------------------------

These are my notes:

# On the Book

This books is about two people who met in college, were going to be married, but the woman ran away from the middle of the engagement ceremony and then they are again engaged.

As the author states, something essential connects them. This is very easy. They are connected by deformed ideas of love and a shared identity that they could not shed.

She panics because she does not discuss her problems and her idea of her future melts away right in front of her. And thereafter she does arbitrary things, does not communicate to anyone and when she meets her boyfriend and takes a look at him having moved on she falls in love with him again. And even he falls in love with her, again, because that desire motivates. And then he is self absorbed in his own way about her. And the girlfriend has no control over him. 

# January 
There's a lot of talk about the reactions she gets when she breaks off the marriage. Dad is confused, mom is angry and both of them are disappointed. Which brings in the next point. She is really, really confused at how she ended up being the disappointing one because she is not the one that disappoints, ever. Because she always behaved like the perfect daughter. And who is the perfect daughter? She does not know, she has an image in mind and she maintains it.

Then we get to see her first meet. What we realize is that she is reads a lot and she did not have time for appearances. She is a thinker. But she thinks a lot. Really. But does not have an internal discipline of truth maintenance. She falls in love with a legend. He is a cricketer. She has heard of him, and he cannot be controlled, can not be tamed, so she gets insecure around him and does not know how to behave. And she tries and dominate him, ""Do you like being ignored?""  Rolls her eyes!

And then there is the scene in which she breaks off her engagement. She runs away in the middle of it all because stress has been building up. And there after, she just starts thinking and feeling sad and keeping her thoughts to herself and being disappointed by life in general. She thinks that this is all turning out to be like other unhappy, sad, emotionless, married couples. And so the idea just freaks her out. And so she does not control and run away. Even in the middle of it, she wants him to come back to her, and run to save her. She is running away, but instead of thinking what she has done to him, she really wants him to come get her back. So. How. How in the world is it possible?

# February 
From a lot of the discussion it is somewhat apparent that she resented the involvement of her family into her life. There is some psychological projection involved as well. Their families are trying to conduct the affairs the way that they know is best. But after all this involvement, Needhi realizes this is not what she had in her mind. Which is to say, she had an idyllic vision of marriage in her head and the world just did not figure into that. So when that image broke, she did not understand what to do about it. The more the image changed, the sadder she got. None of this, she talked with anyone else.  


There is the theme of their careers too. Abhay joined the family business while Needhi did not know what to do with her life. Both are probably liberal arts students, but this is what attracted them to each other - their differences. Abhay is a cricketer and then works with family business. So both require team work while Needhi is a more independent person. This is the kind of person who would do something innovative when she grows up. The problem with Needhi is that she does not grow up. Even Abhay has a few problems to deal with, but since all he has to do is follow the rules it never becomes apparent that he is also immature. Now, major points are that Abhay is self assured and traditional, teamplayer while Needhi is open to new experiences, independent and a thoughtful person of a more gentle demeanour.


Yes, there it is. She has existential problems in life. Who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing? What is my purpose in life? What will bring me happiness? All good questions to ask, and answer, this is a worthy pursuit. Here, she is incompetent. That is the problem. She says she wants a weaker memory and that she wants to be less of a control freak. That is, she remembers every little thing without being able to let go, and even control is also an inability to let go. She has no concept of where her independence ends and where the world begins. She even blames Abhay for not loving her enough or stopping to love him, and this is after she breaks the engagement. So the problem that led to the freaking out at the engagement is being discussed two months after the engagement and it was someone else's fault. In fact, she blames it on him that he did not try to stop her when she was running away even though she wanted him to stop her and this is further proof that he had stopped loving her and she was angry when she was running away that she was not stopping her.

# March

This is where Abhay eMails her. And within this email we get to know one thing, she never picks up his calls. She does accept that this is cowardice, but this needs to be explored. Why does she not pick up calls? Why does she not respond to texts? Why does she respond to him now? This is probably because he was confrontational and formal and he asked her point blank. Why did she do what she did? And then she responds to him. Maybe partially because she loves him and that she never saw him this way. But she responds to him that there was a loss of feeling and that she was a coward not to return calls or texts. And that is there. So. Once the self absorbed image breaks down she starts to feel a distance. This would be repaired only through creative engagement with stress.

She has wrecked her brains but has no answer to his questions: why did she do it. However, Abhay talks about something that hints at her avoidance. She avoids calls. She avoids confrontation. She avoids meeting with Abhay when he is with some other girl and then she avoids getting into engagement. Needhi avoids everything. Needhi has a void inside her after all this avoiding.

Needhi has no answers regarding anything, but Abhay has a very concrete event that precipitated a change in the feelings: when Anamika kissed Abhay and he did not stop. Again, this hints at his lack of self regulation. There are two components: the meaning of the event and the pleasure of the event. Both are controlled by different subsytems in the brain. And this meant that he would not stop the kiss and go with the flow. This created dissonance in her head and wrecked everything apart. They decide to meet, why is that so? This is probably because they had a heart to heart and treated each other with their intimate thoughts so something built up. 

# April
The first thing that jumps out at us is how he just avoids all kind of conversation about the topics that matter. She just does not talk about things that matter to her, to the point that Abhay has to say that he will not accept that ""I don't know"" answer. So all this stupidity for three months? Just so that she could avoid facing uncomfortable situations. In the end she faced an uncomfortable situation because something in her was awakened by a conversation with Abhay. They talked. They talked about what was bothering them and so a little bit of love happened.

She talks about things that make her uncomfortable and gets very emotional, but absolutely refuses to discuss things, because she says there is no point. What she does not realize is that there has to be a point, of answering the question, ""Where do we go from here""? So she keeps ruminating, discussing and talking the same things again and again but she does not know what to do with the discussion. She does not have basic conflict resolution skills. All of this is just her feelings, but she herself does not know what to do with the feelings. 

After having two discussions, one in March and the other in April, about things that she did, she feels a little better. This is because things have moved further and Abhay has discussed and imposed his constraints. Needhi did not accept even to herself that Anamika's kiss had affected her. Which is why this was buried deep down in her psyche and the memories came back later when it was discussed. This is one of those things, she feels that if she does not talk about things then they will go away.

# May
May is her Tinder month. Here she meets three people. The first one is someone who genuinely cares for her, sees her confused and intimidated and guides her through the process. The only mistake he makes is that he does not ask her, but just goes on telling her about what he genuinely thinks is helpful. She feels he is imposing himself on her. And so she does not like it. Then she is surprised that he enjoyed himself and had a good time with her. She ghosts him.

Then there is the MNC guy who is really high up. She is really fascinated by all the work that he does and she really enjoys all the discussion. Now this could have been her ticket up, but even here she makes the mistake that she is doing nothing. She just talks about things, not about herself. This is ofcourse, the same mistake that every one makes, which is the presentation of an image to another person who is presenting an image while you have all these thoughts. All she had to say is, oh god this is so exciting and then all hell would have broken lose.

Then there is Dhruv. Perfect guy again. Does everything. Even stops calling her when she tells him not to. He is perfect in every way but she does not feel the spark. And how is one supposed to feel the spark. Talk! Dhruv, you are such a wonderful person. Oh my God. This is so amazing. Haha! And then he says something. And she talks about her own marriage. And he comforts her and they lean in. And that's that. 

# June
They have a chat in June where they start discussing some things and behave as if things are normal, or near normal. Abhay is chatting with her simply because there is a wedding coming up and he will be there with a girlfriend. Needhi takes the opportunity to give him a chance to have a conversation with her about her life. Now, the two of them have an understanding here that if one talks about her problems, she will simply not have to worry about coming across as weak. In fact that is a signal to come closer. She calls it breaking the ice. She could do the same with other people, but she does not.

She is talking about her coworkers, but she is fairly self obsessed. She has no ability to talk to other people and presents her interpretation of events rather than talk about actual facts.

There is all this talk about awkwardness, which basically makes me think, what the hell? Where is the maturity? Talk about the elephant in the room.

#July 
The one thing that stands out in all of this is Needhi's need not to have awkwardness. Awkwardness is assuming some convention, adhering to it, needing to maintain that and pretending nothing happens outside of that script. For all of Needhi's talk of her famillies adhering to some script, even this one is adherence to a script. Just the one that she chooses. She feels awkwardness, she has to be non chalant yet friendly and still not have to overcompensate. She just can not feel easy, until alcohol comes and solves the problem. Bekhuudi. A disinhibited state. Jaam ki zaroorat, hai jaise, bekhoodi ke liyey, bas ek sanam chahiyey, aashiqui ke liyey!

Needhi's friend confronts her about this and they have a conversation on whether they have really moved on or not. And then, she pushes and pulls. Slowly. She says they have moved on, then maybe they are pretending to have moved on. There is this issue, of imposing an image and pretending that things are a certain way when they themselves don't know how things already are!

Then finally it happens. They both see each other in their prime. Abhay is non challant about everything, because, of course, he has a girlfriend. Needhi becomes vulnerable, partly because she is already in a weakned state because her identity has been broken while Abhay is already there. So she is hungry and in awe of Abhay. And there he is. Non challant! As she says. And so she is weak and beautiful. Abhay takes a look at her and his primal love is reactivated. And she thinks this is love, which partially it is.

# August
She has a mix of depression, anxiety and fever by now. She thinks she was moving on, but then again, she does not move on. The body is different from her self image.  She says she wants to do something, but the body just does not respond. Of course it won't. This is textbook creative stress. Change will not happen in such a manner. And that is the point, she has to confront everything. And had Abhay never really gotten back to her, she would have had to move on and deal with everything, but no, that is not how it happens.

Abhay talks about being distant from his girlfriend. What is going on is that his mind has been occupied by Needhi. Simran is automatically put in the backseat. He keeps on blabbering about how he gave all of him to her but that was not enough, and that introduces us to a new concept. What do you mean giving it his all? So, that is one thing.

She felt better when she had run away, temporarily. But now she is devastated. There she had to confront the fact that life would not be like she imagined it to be so she freaked out. Now she has to confront the fact that she still loves Abhay and she does not have him in her life and so she freaks out again. And this time it is major, because she has to do something. But then, she gets it all without doing anything. She is basically a slave to her feelings. Later on we find out that what she just blurts out everything to him. That is all that she does.

# September
She is reminiscing about their times together. Needhi freaks out always because she has no endgame in mind and when Abhay scolds her or tutors her or lectures her she gets defensive. But the point is that she is reminiscing. All the good memories are coming back.

She admits that they never had any such problems at the time. Why? Because they had nothing to do, really. All they had to do was be in love and enjoy the feeling and keep performing the same identity.

The one thing that I keep missing out on here is that she is doing really badly in her career too. She does not have her shit together. This is form an existential standpoint and also the fact that she has no identity to work from. This is precisely what ego does, it does not settle, it does not sacrifice. It does not know what to do.

# October
She finally gives in. First there is the rumination. She finds a hundred reasons for them not to be together and then she finds a hundred reasons for them to be together.

Trust comes up over and over again. They have trust issues, yes, of course they will have because they are both unable to deal with anything, they have no binding reality and they act on their whims. 

Even though she has been making Abhay dance all over her tune, she blames him for kissing Anamika and precipitating this. She takes no note of the fact that she did not want to deal with it and suppressed the memory.

# November
Abhay is clearly still in love with her, but he is also torn apart. He is completely broken. She just left without an explanation, on a whim without doing anything really to be responsible towards Abhay. So he wants her but he tells her that he cannot trust her and she has to have made a good decision that she is fully in. They do not know what a decision is.

Abhay is made to feel guilty and he is already being manipulated by her unknowingly because he is making the promise that he is going to wake up every day trying to gain her trust. So now we know that they do not have any idea on how trust emerges either. The more important part is that Needhi has a very bad effect on Abhay and the children do not discuss this with their parents or other responsible adults.

Their idea of moving past trauma is to forget it, which is really bad. Cheating and abandoning. Well. What the fuck. Really. Also, I promise to be yours if you promise to be mine. Mine and yours. Also. What the fuck. Conditional love. It's not conditional, it's a contract.

# December
She feels 19 again.

They have a set of promises one is about playing devil's advocate.

They are marrying, but then since they have not had any commitments here, no concept and no growth what is going on is that they will break up again, brutally. And that is why this is a viciously funny book if you know what the fuck is going on. She breaks up with him and then tells him to marry him again and now they are going to marry each other without changing anything. So what happened, really? Nothing! This almost reads like an episode of Sillicon Valley.

I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I'll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction. Writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself.

I am afraid to tell her anything just because I am bald and am pretty sure she would reject my advances. This is not meant to be bragging, but  I am actually quite well settled for life in a secure job and being an only child, the legal heir to my parents' properties. I have come to terms with the fact of my baldness, but she is the only fact I haven't come to terms with. Everytime I see her, there is this feeling of overwhelming helplessness and numbness. Should I tell her of my love for her or should I just forget her and resign myself to my fate?

**Second Edit**: Sorry if i came across as childish or immature. Truth be told, i was drunk when i made this post and perhaps it impacted my replying to some of the posts. Some of you have suggested  
to talk to her and not make assumptions about her. She is actually fully aware that i like her, and as one friend has rightly commented below that it is a case of one sided love. Perhaps talking to her is the only way to get out of this misery. I have decided to do this in the next week. My birthday is in Feb. and I pray to God that by that time i would be able to invite her to my b'day party. I will give an update, irrespective of the result.

AskIndia,[Shower Thought] Subsidies and cheap favours by political parties make people happy enough to vote those parties most likely because people have low standards due to poverty.,23,6voqzs,SoulsBorNioh,15,"Think about it. If people weren't poor, they wouldn't care for subsidies. Rich people don't need subsidies. The poor do. Even the middle class live such stressful lives that any subsidies that can help them in saving up for their income for old age makes them happy.

AskIndia,PSA: /r/India Submission Flairs & How to Use Them,43,4fyjjl,r_india_mod,33,"###/r/India submission flairs and how to use them

#Q: What are submission flairs and what are they used for?

A: Submission flairs are the text-boxes that appear next to your submission title when you post something on /r/India. There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).

#Q: How do I know what flair to use?

A: Use common sense, for example:

* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. 

* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.

* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.

* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. 

* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.


#Q: How do I apply the flairs?

A: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.
**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png

If you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.

* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]
* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]
* Scheduled: [Scheduled]
* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]
* Sports: [Sports], [SP]
* Policy: [Policy]
* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]
* Food: [Food], [FO]
* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]

#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?

A: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. 

#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?

A: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. 

If we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc.

AskIndia,Well articulated anti congress Whatsapp forward. Bhakton ki nayi [p]eshkash,2,7zckca,Bikihuigormint,5,"


Received on the family whatsapp group

""A brilliant answer by Bala Senthil Kumar to the question below, as answered at popular Q&A site Quora.

 What is your view on the saying ""Congress has looted India for 70 years?""

It isn't the looting of wealth that bothers me so much as the sheer fact that the Congress merely replaced the Brits in some ways - they just became masters of the same, broken, weak people, who were simply willing to suck up to authority. Nobody gave India confidence! This is the part that bothers me so much, especially with MK Gandhi's style of 'winning' us freedom by giving the enemy higher moral ground.

So, India has grown up as an apologetic impotent nation, where our children are taught to revere impractical, passive, cowardly notions like non-violence, when everything in nature tells us to fight to survive. Of course I know the philosophy of not fighting because of being strong. But this comes from mastery, not shamelessly bowing to masters!

So, we saw a change of guard. The Brits went, and new masters came in the form of the Congress Party. Hierarchies remained, the class system remained, and subservience remained. Where the heck did all the dynamism go?

Then we were thrown into a socialist mindset, people waiting for alms from government wealth redistribution programs instead of being empowered. We got protectionist policies, that prevented prosperity and competition, throwing us away from a path of a meritocracy. Hindustan Motors was started around the same time as Toyota, and Tata Steel started around the same time as Nippon Steel. Nippon Steel produces around five times as much as Tata Steel without native resources of ore. No need to talk about Hindustan Motors and Toyota. Japan coming out of twin nuclear strikes was devastated way more than India under the Brits. Do we need to compare how different the growth paths of these two nations have been?

Only when thousands died did we start the Green Revolution. Only when China attacked us did we realize we need to become militarily stronger. Only with our backs against the wall, did India liberalize its economy. Under the Congress, every move we have made towards any kind of development has come under inevitable circumstances, with our backs against the wall.

India was never allowed to be truly independent, strong, and proud of its people's full potential. No wonder so many of us left in droves and thrived in various countries elsewhere. This is the loot I would feel most wronged by - denying India its best talents and minds, because we didn't create the conditions for dignified development.

Incredibly, the immense sacrifices of our fighting heroes were also swept aside under this avalanche of worship for Gandhiji. Why? So that the Brits would feel good? The Congress party was reporting to British Intelligence for 5 years after we became an independent country, about Subhash Bose's family's movements. During a criminal probe of the Bofors scandal, the Congress External Affairs minister delivered a letter to a foreign body to deny evidence and cooperation to an Indian investigating agency. Years later, a whole bunch of Congress members and their cronies used the letterhead of the Indian Parliament to petition the USA to not issue a visa to Narendra Modi, the man who would become Prime Minister. 

The Congress has a clear obsession with white people and a need to constantly please them. When Hillary Clinton asked India to wean itself off Iranian oil, the Congress government promptly obliged, even though Iran and India have been close friends for a long time. No surprise then that pasta aunty from Italy is their supremo. Think she would have got the same respect if she had been a Nigerian black woman? I don't think so. That's how deeply ingrained the slave mentality is in the ranks of the Congress.

It is the loot of India's pride, dignity, dynamism and die hard spirit that bothers me much much more than the loot of wealth. This country produced enough wealth to support the British Empire for 200 years. It can easily produce much more to ensure prosperity, health and well being for its own people. This is an abundant, powerful country, that has been prevented from being a developed, forward thinking, awesome nation that could by now have been an example for the world.

If India has been a weak, apologetic nation for so long, it's precisely because of the Congress. Why do we have to put up with these weasels and the fools who are aligning with them? I could even tolerate a ruthless, despotic, dictatorial mindset. It is this slimy, backstabbing, self serving Lutyens mindset that really irks me. I would give anything to destroy this smugness, decimate it, and put it firmly behind us.

The economic loot is nothing compared to this, but we will bloody well make them pay for all of it.

AskIndia,"[R] Updated Wiki, Rules & Flairs",31,3huilc,r_india_mod,98,"#Comment Moderation in Political & Religious Threads

* Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.
* Slurs and invectives - we need to participate in discussions without resorting to juvenile name calling.
* Flaming the forum, that is, asking “where are the people of X party or Y group now” adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed. 
* Serious, on topic, high effort conversation. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
* **Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.**

The basic premise is that your comment should be constructive and should add something to the discussion. If all you are looking to do is pick a fight, then /r/India is not the place for you. 

#The Governance Flair

* **Would be renamed to Policy**. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government (or new policy discussions that /r/India participants want to focus on) and applies to self-posts as well as link-posts. 
* **Comment Moderation would be similar to Political Threads.**
* To ensure that the focus remains on the policy aspect of a political post, users **must** add a submission statement limiting the discussion to a specific policy issue, and/or a specific policy correction.


#Low Effort Political/Policy/Religious Posts

* Link submissions that refer personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a self-post (accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions; @PMOIndia is allowed). 
* Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.  
* Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.
* Similar rule applies for image submissions for political/policy/religious posts. OP must cite the source for the image and accompany the image submission with a statement regarding the topic he/she wishes to discuss.

#Unverified Posts

* Info-graphics, images, selfs posts and other similar content which makes (an) assertion(s) but lacks (a) source(s) will be removed. The original submitter [OP] should post the source (if it is not cited in the submission itself) as soon as possible. If the OP receives a message from a moderator stating that their post has been delisted [removed] due to lack of source, they may still provide the source and the the submission will be relisted [unremoved].

#Editorialising

* Editorialising is not acceptable. Editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a (submission) title. You should, in most cases, use the title on the page you are linking to. 
* However, in the case of YouTube, you may have to be inventive and attempt to create an **nonpartisan** and **neutral** title if the one the YouTube video uses is clearly partisan and bias.

#Subreddit promotion via user flairs

* You are allowed to promote any subreddit with your user flairs as long as the subreddit you are promoting is listed under the [list of India related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/related_subreddits) at the /r/India wiki. 

#Mobile Flairs
* AskIndia: [Ask], [AS], [Askindia],[Help]

AskIndia,[Modpost] New Flairs for /r/India and Improving Discussions on /r/India,78,3de8cn,r_india_mod,234,"Hello folks!

Moderators of /r/India here (using a common account).

###Flairs

We promised to give you flairs, and we have not kept our promise. So, here goes. We suggest the following flairs (and if there are any that you want to see added, please suggest them)

* AskIndia
* Governance: To separate policy decisions from Political Posts

As mentioned above, please suggest new flairs that you would want to see. 

Now, let's address discussion in /r/India threads, especially political posts. A few ideas. **Do note that these are only ideas, we are not implementing them. We are only looking for your opinion**. 

###Political Posts

* No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.
* Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced. We want to implement this, but we have fallen short because we don't have enough active moderators. We would need to hire more. The problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do this. 
* Remove low-effort political self-posts. 

### Non-political posts

* Same rule as politics for Twitter post (and other social media screenshots including memes). Specify what you want to discuss and substantiate your stand in a self-post. /r/India should not be the place to discuss WhatsApp forwards. 

Please feel free to disagree with all the points made here. :)

AskIndia,"Older, more experienced people of India: What will actually happen if I marry outside my caste?",7,4qepvz,rajasthaniConfused,14,"Reposting from [here](https://yy.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/4qazaw/what_will_actually_happen_if_i_marry_outside_my/)

I am a 26 year old guy in love with my girlfriend from college in India. Both of us are working outside India in the same city. I am from Rajasthan and from Agarwal community. My girlfriend is belongs to a scheduled caste and is from Maharashtra. Both of us obviously don't care about the caste system.

Now my parents are against our relationship. They hate SC people in general. Some of the reasons they are opposing the marriage 

1. It will tarnish their prestige.
2. It will lower their standing in the community.
3. It will be difficult to find a match for my younger sister (7 years younger)
4. My entire extended family has hopes from me. (I don't understand this one either :P)
5. I don't know the best for me, they do.

Now I understand that they are orthodox and probably had dreams about my future wife. I don't expect them to change their views quickly (may be they never will).

What I actually want to know in case they never accept my girlfriend and I decide to marry her:

1. Will it really affect my sister's wedding?
2. What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

Thank you for all the comments and thoughts on the feedback thread. Based on that here are the most popular suggestions and our decisions

**Edit** - **check out the clarification about user's posting history, please**

* Bring back old “United We Stand Banner” - **done**

* New link flairs  to be introduced - 

   * Old article (older than 6 months)

   * Technology (phone reviews)

   * Arts (bollywood, music, books, poetry)

   * Finance

  * Twitter

  * Sports

  * AskIndia


* Clarification on Flairs: User flairs have been enabled for a few months now. Just a reminder though, any flair which breaks the css or the reddit default format will be removed. Any flair that targets individuals will be removed. 

* Score hiding - **This is a reddit feature which hides votes/total score for a set interval. Since we're constantly the target of voting brigades, we'll be hiding scores for an hour to break up the voting patterns and make sure that comments are voted purely on the basis of merit. Scores will be hidden for 60 minutes. Subscribers will still be able to see the scores on their comments.**

* Selecting the next moderator - **Since we need a new mod in the near future, we will ask for people to sign up/nominate themselves. We will then create a shortlist and let /r/india debate on the people in the list. Expect more details in a separate thread.**

* About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed - **looks like these sites have now gotten mainstream with a lot of non-spammy users submitting links from them. Please use voting to keep clickbaits down and we will ban new spam sites.**

* Repost removal policy - **all reposts/same news will be directed to the first post it's category. The repost window will be 4 hours long**

* Personal Attack Rule Review - **No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now**. 

* Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? **Yes.** 

**Edit** - As long as you bring up the history of the person you're actually talking to - and not name drop some other redditor it won't count as a personal attack.


* Cross Posting: You may cross post threads in the line of /r/bestof, but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation. Additionally cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india on the subreddit's request. Please keep other subs' rules in mind before posting here. For instance /r/polandball does not allow xposts to communities as large as ours.

Additionally, please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. The place to ask for removal clarifications is modmail not the subreddit. We respond to the best of our abilities and fast as we can, excuse any delays on weekends and holidays etc. Please also note that in some cases there are delays because the mod in question might go offline thanks to timezones. 

Thanks!

AskIndia,[Mod Post] Introducing new flairs for better organization of content.,55,3ecyjp,r_india_mod,33,"Dear subscribers,

A week ago we requested for feedback on introduction of new flairs for better organization of content and your consumption. We have deliberated on your feedback and we now support new flairs.

* **Sports, Technology, Food** - The title of these flairs are self-explanatory.
* **Scheduled** - This flair will be associated for regular threads like RDD, Books, Movies etc. The introduction of this flair is to encourage more such weekly threads by our subscribers. We would love to see regular threads on our sub.
* **Ask India** - This flair relates to any question that you'd like to ask the r/India community. For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations.
* **Governance** - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet. We would like to see more such traction on different fronts.  However, please note that this flair is specifically for public policy related decisions. **Each post with the Governance flair should be a self-post ONLY.**

We hope these new flairs help better consume and organize content. We would love to see more posts from our vibrant community.

Cheers!

**Suggestions on the following topics are welcome**

* Colour Codes for the flair (in case you have better suggestions or an overall theme look in mind)
* More Flair Categories

AskIndia,Any complications in future jobs because of absconding from workplace?,4,3eesdr,ownliner,7,"A friend of mine quit his previous company and joined another org. But unfortunately he did not like it a bit. In a month and a half he got another offer, which is better. So he is planning to abscond from his current workplace(as the notice period is 3 months) and join the other org as early as possible.

BUT, what he has done is, he hasn't told the new org that he has already joined another org and will be absconding from there. All the documents for background verification are of his previous org.

So, is there going to be any complications in the future after he joins this new org? He is worried because he has got one month salary and PF from the company he joined recently but has not disclosed the same while getting another offer. He has told them that he is not working currently and can join immediately!!

AskIndia,Bill Gates' thoughts on Climate change and India's Role in it.,84,3wcid0,running_flash,10,"He thinks that asking India to switch to cleaner and costlier energy is unfair. The developed world should take the initiative, dramatically increase investment in Energy R&D and come up with cheaper alternatives that are sustainable for developing economies like ours. 
Here's the excerpt from his interview with The Atlantic. 
>..when you turn to India and say, “Please cut your carbon emissions, and do it with energy that’s really expensive, subsidized energy,” that’s really putting them in a tough position, because energy for them means a kid can read at night, or having an air conditioner or a refrigerator, or being able to eat fresh foods, or get to your job, or buy fertilizer.

>I’m a big believer in foreign aid, but the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. China and the U.S. and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions, and when they do, hopefully they’ll make it cheap enough for everyone else. But the big numbers are all in the developed economies, where China’s defined into that term.

> I want to call up India someday and say, “Here’s a source of energy that is cheaper than your coal plants, and by the way, from a global-pollution and local-pollution point of view, it’s also better.”

AskIndia,[NP] Which Tax Return to file if I'm both salaried and making money from side-gig?,7,6jnnbm,microsoftholmes,2,"Hi, throwaway account.

Need some help / advice from you guys.

I am a salaried software engineer in Bangalore, but I'm also getting offers for freelance stuff. I am mulling over a few of these.

One of them seems promising. Three dudes in US are asking me to help bootstrap their startup, and I think I'd take this one.

They are willing to pay me $1000-$2000 for a month of initial work. There's also a possibility of getting more work if they get seed funding.

I am worried about the tax return filing next year. Up until now, I have only filed ITR based on Form-16 from employer. Never had to worry about foreign payment for services provided.

Should I file ITR-4 in 2018? 

Or can I just mention it as ""income from other sources"" under ITR-1?

They are also willing to offer me some equity. Don't know how international equity compliance works, so if any of you have any experience, that would be helpful.

I am sure there are plenty of you folks here who have faced a similar situation. I google a lot (my google-foo isn't that good), and posted in some CA forum, but no reply.

AskIndia,The long and fascinating story of how Dadra and Nagar Haveli got integrated into India.,18,25ix5m,iKidA,2,"India is a big, complicated country with a big, complicated history. This means that any reasonably efficient attempt at trying to make sense of Indian history must, unfortunately, gloss over the hundreds of thousands of little stories that went into making modern India. Take, for instance, the liberation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

> *""On the night of July 22, 1954, a group of nearly fifteen volunteers of the United Front of Goans (UFG) under the leadership of freedom fighters Francis Mascarenhas and Vaman Desai assembled outside the border to discuss the details of the assault. They marched across the border and approached Dadra, around midnight. When they neared the police station, they recognised sub-inspector Aniceto Rosario, their archenemy. He was responsible for the ill treatment of UFG members in the police custody at Daman and they sought revenge. At that time, he was addressing a group of 100 to 150 villagers; warning them against the illegal entry by outsiders through their fields. They were also told that disobeying the orders would be met with serious consequences. The volunteers managed to crawl into the village, while some of them mixed with the locals assembled at the meeting. The remaining went round and began to close in from behind the police station.""*

Much violence followed. More [here](http://www.navhindtimes.in/ilive/how-18th-june-road-got-its-name). And in this newspaper clipping [here](http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19540724&id=wXUjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sL4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=5673,3493515).

Two weeks later Nagar Haveli was also captured, and the liberators declared that the little enclave was now ""Free Dadra And Nagar Haveli"", an independent country, with no international recognition of course, but run by a pro-Indian government called the Varishtha Panchayat. Some time afterwards the Panchayat asked India for help to run the enclave. 
> *""In response to requests from the Varishta Panchayat and the Administrator of Nagar-Aveli, Dr. A. Furtado, who proposed to resign, the Government of India agreed to make available the services of a senior officer of the Indian Administrative Service as the Administrator of those areas. Shri K. G. Badlani took over as the new Administrator with effect from 17 October 1960. It is also proposed to elect a new Panchayat to replace the present Panchayat which consists of nominees. This new Panchayat would act as the Legislative Council of the liberated areas.""*

From this Ministry of External Affairs report [here](http://mealib.nic.in/?pdf2487?000). (PDF)

Meanwhile the Portuguese government took India to the International Court of Justice. The court passed a judgement that upheld the Portuguese claim that its sovereign territory had been over-run, but then curiously passed another judgement that prevented the Portuguese from actually doing anything about the Indian 'invasion'.  Copy of the judgement [here](http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/32/4521.pdf). (PDF)

Understandably, both countries insisted that the ruling went in their respective favour.

Thus for seven years, from 1954 to 1961, Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli existed in a state of political limbo, nicely helped along by the government of India and Mr. Badlani.

And then in 1961, after Portuguese India had fallen and been annexed by Indian forces, D&NH requested to be merged with India. The popular telling of what happened next is as follows: D&NH quickly created a legislature, that then elected IAS officer KG Badlani as Prime Minister of Dadra and Nagar Haveli for just one day. That same day he signed over the territory to the Republic of India. And this handover was formalized with the tenth amendment to the Indian Constitution. Amendment details [here](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/NowHereThis/now-here-this-6/1076673-164.100.47.134/intranet/cai/a.pdf?c=66b2a0b7-a1c6-4faa-8c15-2659fdd94b72). (PDF)

I've not been able to source any documents to suggest that Badlani was actually made a ""Prime Minister For A Day"". But there is little doubt that he was, if only briefly, the head of state of a tiny little quasi-independent enclave in India before it was gobbled up by the republic.

And thus, my email-friends, was a nation built.

AskIndia,"[AskIndia] Fathers/mothers of Reddit India, what were the 38-41 weeks of pregnancy like for you? Long post ahead.",11,fkql7h,2throwawaythrowaway,5,"Hi everyone!

I am currently in my 25th week (late 2nd trimester) and I'm trying to educate myself about what lies ahead for me. I have to zero in on the most important decision - the city of birth (job city?/my hometown?/husband's hometown?). I need to decide this ASAP as traveling after 28 weeks(April end that is) is generally not advised.

Which brings me to making this post here. I want to gather all the information/anectodes/experiences, in a countdown way, about the D-Day/D-weeks. If the circumstances allow, I would prefer a normal delivery. However, I totally understand how uncertain pregnancies can get. I just feel being informed can help us stay less anxious & not panic. Its going to be long and my thoughts might seem all over the place, so please bear with me. Here are my questions:

1) How frequent are the scheduled* OB/GYN visits in the very last month, assuming a normal pregnancy? Currently I visit once a month, for routine check up and milestone/mandated tests (flu vaccination, various blood tests, sonography, etc)

*(By scheduled I mean no complication was experienced by the woman or any urgency(water breaking, bleeding, etc) occured)

2) One lady who had the same OBGYN as me when went for her scheduled 37th week visit, was told she will have a C-Section as the child is getting overweight (weighing 3 kgs then). The OBGYN asked her to soon decide which date she would like the surgery to happen and let the doctor know. The lady said she however got labor pain the very next day and delivered via vaginal delivery. Now, I am a little skeptical here; from what I've read, **2.5-3.5 kgs is the average birth weight for newborns in India**. How can 3 kgs be overweight then? I'm already very paranoid about the state of deliveries in urban, big-name hospitals and this incident scares me more. There is no data public on the number of normal and surgical deliveries a hospital has, so that one can decide, and once you're in, you're in. After that, you have to leave everything at the doctor.

3) One lady who delivered at the same hospital (different OBGYN) as me, went at 37 weeks when she felt contractions. Her cervix was examined twice in a 5 hour span. She said she couldn't bear going through that painful examination again and asked for a C-Section herself (totally fair). My question is, are these cervix examinations by hand so necessary, when they're leaving the bearing lady in pain? Is there no other way (imaging, ultrasound, etc)? My point is those contractions could have been what is called 'false labor' and if not for the pain due to the examination, that lady could have gone home and come again full-term or when she felt contractions again?

4) My sister went for a scheduled visit in 38th week. Her cervix was examined, she started bleeding. She was told to come back if bleeding continued till evening, which it did. She had to be operated the next day, after staying in labor room for some 24-32 hours. This again makes me skeptical about cervix examinations.

5) What's the countdown going to be like? When does one know that ""yes, its now that I rush to the hospital."" Should I be scared of just a few drops of blood? Should I rush the very first time I experience period like cramps? From my few interactions with mothers, I feel 37-38 weeks is the sweet spot where many things happen. I know my post gives a lot of distrusting vibes towards doctors, that they're there to loot us, they try to 'invent' some complication in these sweet spot weeks to push for C-Sections, etc. Trust me, I would like to be proven wrong. Hence, I'm here to collect as much anectodes about false alarms, doctor sending the lady home even after mild contractions as its not time yet instead of asking to schedule a C-Section, etc as I can.

5) From what I understand, some women might never experience labor even after 40-41 weeks and hence have to be induced. Are some women induced before that too? What could lead to induction before full term?

6) Do all women having a vaginal delivery get an epidural/other pain medication, or only those who demand it when they get tired, or when they can't bear pain?

7) Did anyone research natural birth centers? There are many in the major cities, like 1) Sanctum Birth Center, Hyderabad, 2) Birth Village, Kochi, 3) Daimaas Natural Birth Center, Mumbai, 4) Apollo Cradle, Gurugram. Google reviews are mixed. Anyone undertook the services of these natural birth centers?

1. Carry pepper spray. Also, please do an emergency drill for using it. 

2. Learn self-defense martial arts. 

3. Carry taser?

4. Always notify someone while traveling alone in cab/auto. Share registration number of vehicle loudly on call.  So that driver knows someone is aware of your whereabouts. 

5. In case you are stranded somewhere if traveling in a car, do lock all the windows and call the police.  In case of 2 wheeler, just ditch it or ride with punctured tire to nearest petrol pump, toll, shop.

Over the last few years, I have been earning a lot more money than before and I want to use some of it to help others who aren't as fortunate.

Currently I am sponsoring the education for 2 siblings with a single mother and few other small donations which I don't even need twice to say yes to. 

Most appeals for financial help that I come across on social media are well within my means to help, but I'm not sure if that's the best way to spend my money. 

This post  is mostly to help me decide what kind of efforts I should be funding. So I can set aside funds for such causes and whenever I come across an appeal, I shouldn't have to think about whether I should donate or how much etc. 

I would like to donate to things that can significantly change people's lives for the better. (Beyond just helping them survive/maintain status quo.)

Things I don't feel comfortable sponsoring, 
 - Expensive school education(pre-classX) for under privileged kids. (Expensive = 20-30k per annum, I don't mind funding someone's college education for a lot moret, but I feel  it's super expensive for school fees.) 
 - Expensive medical treatment for strangers with low chances of survival. (I'm conflicted on this, but my thinking the same amount of money can help a lot more people instead of feeding into medical industry profits. I may think differently if it was a family member or close friend.)

Or if you know any low profile people/organisations doing good work, please share information here.

Here are the things I've heard gym trainers say in a couple of cities in India (translated).

""You won't gain weight now. It's summer, you will sweat too much to gain weight.""

""You don't need to do warm-ups dude. Just lift."" (This guy came three weeks later with his shoulder in a sling. Kya hua? Dislocate ho gaya)

""You *have* to do 15 reps, everything else is wrong. 3 sets of 6? How will the muscle get stimulated?""

""Compound exercises are for 'fitness'. Isolation exercises are for muscle building.""

""Optimum Nutrition? *ON*?? Koi local brand hoga..""

""Don't listen to doctors. Doctors themselves come to my gym."" (said by the same guy who said don't warm up).

**EDIT**: BONUS:
""Deadlifts? One palm grips front, one grips reverse. Haan, jaise phaavda leke gaddha khodne waale ho"".

And his kids thrashed the house completely. There was crayons scribbles everywhere, mud everywhere, even adults drew rangoli on the wall!

Now: I told him, I will deduct unpaid rent, the cost of painting, and to fix broken things from the security deposit. The guy is acting like complete asshole, locking the front gate and not returning the keys to the house, until I repay the security deposit in full!

AskIndia,[AskIndia] Why do we have so much distrust of Businesses and Markets?,14,di5x69,ohdickens,16,"Was listening to a talk from Kunal Shah (founder of Freecharge and Cred) and found quite a few insights about the attitude of Indians towards generating wealth through businesses.

A few things really stood out. For example -

1. India has a unique MRP system for products found nowhere else in the world. It gives us the illusion that we are charged fairly for our goods but it works very counter-intuitively against the poor.
Because the rich pay almost the same price as the poor. A richer neighbourhood should have richer prices than in a poorer neighbourhood.
The manufacturer has to price the MRP at a rate higher than he would in a competitive market because he needs to make sure he covers his cost or overruns due to dead or destroyed stock.

2. How we, as Indians, value money over time. We would not pay for quality which saves us time but we will gladly buy sub-quality goods if it saves us money.

3. We question and probe profit percentages of each private company but have no clue about the efficiency of government spending and yet we keep clamouring for more taxes.

4. Pre-1991, we were poor and ridden with Socialist policies which championed the poor and the farmers and we went bankrupt. But after 1991, when we allowed foreign money to come in, we saw a substantial rise in the standard of living and goods.
Yet, we are still calling restrictions on foreign capital in e-commerce and retail which is just perplexing.

5. We think the private companies are out to loot the people of India and we think Adani and Ambani are rich because of Modi but it is, in fact, the lack of competition and implementation of endless rules and licenses that allow Adani and Reliance to operate in any field with almost no competition.


I don't get it. Is this an education thing? Have we been taught capitalism incorrectly? The numbers are so clear yet we are still stuck in denial about having government involvement in the economy. So many people flock to capitalist economies from India yet why do we trust the government so much?

And before anyone says, yes I do think Healthcare, defense, law and order should be under government along with economic incentives for education and research but beyond that, you don't really need government.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/di5x69/askindia_why_do_we_have_so_much_distrust_of/

I have an appointment with lawyer next monday to discuss this over. The wait of next two days sees unbearably long. 

Knowing my wife, I know it's going to be a big drama which I want to avoid at all costs. I just want to put evidence of her activities before her and part our ways silently. What kind of technology can I use to monitor her email, phone (voice and text), social media communications (Fb) for few days? I will also hire a PI the first thing the next week.

I'd like to have full custody of our children. Does anyone know under what conditions will I be able to get that?

Thanks for all your responses. Few were helpful, few disturbing and few others distasteful. Anyway, I am just normal at home as if nothing happened.

I am very methodical and I'll deal with this issue just like that. I am going to write down everything I plan to do, rehearse it multiple times with my lawyer (he responded), plug holes and build a solid case.

There are many suggesting that I don't monitor her activities as it's illegal. I can appreciate that. But I am anyway going to do it. What's important to me primarily is the evidence, the truth and the full picture. What I do with it is totally a different matter altogether. I may not tell her, I may just poke and see the response, I may not not use the evidence for legal proceedings (and that's up to lawyer anyway) or I may just burn it all.

#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

* Do
 * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
 * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
 * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
 * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
* Don't
 * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

AskIndia,[AskIndia] Currency exchange to EUR - Help!,1,dcvch3,straysandcurrant,7,"Hi,

I'm going to Italy later this month and I'm really confused about what I should do about currency. I'm from Bangalore and I've asked around. I get different opinions about exchanging. 

Some people think I should find an exchange here in Bangalore which gives the best rate; others think that I should just use my debit card and some others think that I should get a forex card from my bank.  

For anyone who's well versed with this, what's the best thing to do here? I'd really appreciate some advice.

UPDATE: I ended up getting an ICICI Bank Multi currency travel card because:

1. ICICI Bank is my primary bank account and the process was quick.

2. I didn't see significant differences in exchange/conversion rates across other banks.

3. ICICI allows me to recharge my travel card through my iMobile app, even from abroad. This was a huge plus. 

Additionally, I used bookmyforex.com to get some currency notes delivered to me. It was super convenient, so I highly recommend it to anyone else who's travelling.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dcvch3/askindia_currency_exchange_to_eur_help/

AskIndia,[AskIndia] Is there an Indian equivalent of Hikikomori taking place in our society?,272,a7m150,RagiModi,130,"Hikikomori is a social phenomenon observed in Japan. It's a case of social withdrawal, where young people just stay indoors for years and years. They don't go out, or work (becoming NEETS - Not in Education, Employment, or Training), or socialize IRL. Their whole lives just revolve around the apartments they stay in (some alone, some with their parents).

Their reasons can vary - fear of societal disappointment, anxiety, depression, heartbreak, etc. It has much to do with the work culture of Japan, with its insanely long working hours, high expectations, conformity, and rigid social rules. I'd suggest reading about [Hikikomori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori) and checking out some of the IAMAs done on it. And the anime, Welcome to the NHK.

**Now, the point: would you say that this is happening to some degree in India as well?**

Some of the factors that cause this are common here. Japan is very different from India so let's get past that bit. However, we do have similarities. Indians are [increasingly overworked](https://qz.com/india/1030594/indian-millennials-are-overworked-and-sick-of-office-politics/) with most of our workers [burning out](https://qz.com/india/1401250/indias-unhealthy-workforce-stands-in-the-way-of-economic-growth/) from unhealthy conditions. [Indians are lonely](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-04/india-obsession-with-sons-millions-of-lonely-men-after-dowry/7903134) and many millions will, statistically, die alone. This is not to count the actual problem that we have no dating culture in India, and the fact that most men are unlikely to be well-socialized with women - who then watch movies about romance and start to wonder why their lives don't match up with what's on screen. Indian male loneliness is crippling, and prevalent, in my opinion.

Like Japan, we also have strong family structures, so that an unemployed youth staying at home and slowly rotting away isn't uncommon. In fact, in Kerala, I would say every family has one. There are cousins and uncles - people who for unexplained reasons end up doing nothing but staying at home. We have people who strike out into depression after failing the IIT-JEEs and AIEEEs or back papers, who stay home and seldom if not never come out. I'm sure many have posted on this subreddit as well. 

**One strange parallel I feel we have with the Hikikomori is the IAS aspirant**. There is a degree of social isolation and staying-at-home-for-years that happens with both IAS aspirants and Hikikomori that really strikes me. OFC not all IAS aspirants are the same but I know one shut-in and one on his way to becoming one, perhaps. Anyway this is just my view.

What do you think, though? Are a lot of young Indians locking themselves away from society as well? Have you ever felt the urge? Any discussion appreciated. 

I write as someone who's been unemployed for a good year now and I can feel the yawning chasm of social reclusion approach. Most of my year was at home, though I took gaps to travel. This was more a recluse from my career than from socializing, though I do feel I've been meeting fewer new people than I normally do.

I have been reading on many websites and trying to find out the processes, terminology and what not - just to be stuck in reading but not doing anything.

Randian's who have managed to and/or doing it on there own, please put in your experiences and guides to do the needful.

I'd like to stress here that though the process is considered simpler now, it seems far too bureaucratic  for a IT simpleton like me. From what I have read and understood:

* LLP or Private Limited are better than OPC (why?)
* LLP or PL need 3 people, while OPC needs one and one for nomination
* register company, get some secure USB token
* register trade marks (but no idea how to register different company names and products - like One97 and Paytm) for apt classes (35 to 45) or in all of them
* dedicated Office : needed or not?
* GST, VAT, etc :  what's needed and when?

And then there is freelancing and creating your own product - for which what and what not's are not clear anywhere. because presumably you'd need trademark and stuff there too and you also need TAN and PAN and DIN and current accounts and etc.

What I am interested in creating my web based product, and deploying it and making money. problem is I don't know if it is actually that simple.

So I don't want to make it about myself. I'd like this to be for others too who might want to seek up similar help or who'd step on this path in future.

Please, help and post your knowledge and experiences.

AskIndia,[AskIndia] Can Dawood Ibrahim be a Free Man as per current state of Indian Judiciary?,11,dic1m6,xinamongarglic,1,"
Before anybody comments shit instead of discussion, 

A) I'm a 5th Generation Maharashtrian (that I know of) and 3rd Generation Mumbaikar aged 41. So obviously I'm not a Muslim or a Pakistani posting here. Its sad that it has come down to this that one has to prove his Nationalism for any freeminded discussion. We all let it happen, it's our fault not of Bhakts.

B) Not a Dalit but a Chitpavan Brahmanvad, so I can claim My Hinduism to any Hindutva turd and tell them to back the fuck off, in real world. I'll show my clout and power to those, if and when need arises. Because that's not relevant here and i'm just clearing this for stupid and ignorant Bhakts.

Now, since that part is cleared, I definitely am not a supporter or a fan of Dawood or his chain of gangsters ever. Dawood was just a name whom every gangster wannabe wanted to have that kind of power that he had in his time of late 80s and 90s. Everyone as a kid used to mock himself as Bhai or Dawood gang leader just for fun. That was the kind of cult Dawood had in his prime, the mumbai underworld king. Look at any big international gangsters stories and Dawood was no different. From actors to politicians, businessmen and builders, Gold and Diamond merchants and every small or big scale citizens of India was affiliated with Dawood once directly or indirectly. During that period, only the Law enforcement and Cops gave actual shit to pin his empire down and common citizens never gave a fuck about it, like how the common people are doing now but it is pointless since he is overseas or Pakistan or wherever he can easily travel.

I'm positive that he had hands on Mumbai serial blasts, everybody thinks that because some cops were sure of it based on tips and infos. But that's that. Finito. No hard evidence to back up the cops theory cuz it's obvious he didn't plant those bombs himself. His minions did. And those minions of his used some 3rd party to do the dirty work, similar to lower class poor needy should shitbag. So one cannot even prove that it links to Dawood based on hard evidence. There is none. It's only a feeling that we think Dawood did it. No matter how much We as citizens believe that he did it, our Judiciary will still not be convinced and will let him go Scott free. Because it happened 25 years ago. Ofcourse Dawood will not come down and will confess, not will his supporters or even his enemies will do it too. Because even his enemies hates cops and law and order. A common ground between every rival gangster is that to keep cops at Bay. So nobody will ever come out and will be a witness. Chotta Rajan? Hahaha....he was once a part of Dawood gang, so whatever he will claim will come down to him as well. To be honest, he is no good use to the courts as he himself is a criminal with so many cases against him.

Ofcourse he has knowledge of Dawood a whereabouts, but how much really does he know since 5 years have passed and Dawood is still nowhere to be traced. Even if he is located, how will anybody bring him to India? And even if he is nabbed, what will be the charges? How will he be put behind bars cuz so far not a single chargesheet has been made against him, criminal or otherwise. He is still well protected by his old friends who are old politicians, actors and businessmen who are much too afraid that whatever criminal charges will be put against Dawood, it will all be linked to them, one or the other ways.

So how is he a Terrorist, Criminal and Most Wanted? When in reality nobody wants him in India or else all hell will break loose once he starts to reveal all the dirty secrets. Which current politician wants that? Why would these Rich people wants a noose on their neck to bring Dawood back? To end Terrorism for good, these Rich people will sacrifice their 29 years ""good"" image?

Another thing is, what Dawood did back then, is the very same Sadhvi Pragya was charged for. Serial blasts that is. Now she is in Modi government. Because the Lawyers got her out. Because it's Lawyers job to defend. And they won't do the same for Dawood if the price is right? So it is safe to say Dawood of he gets nabbed and sent back to India, he will get out Scott free. It's only that the BJP has put an image that since he is a Muslim and is in Pakistan so he is a Terrorist. What they will never say is , Dawood is a free man in India even today but if Dawood chooses to reveal all the secrets, no politicians, Actors, Actresses, Businessmen images will be safe. And he would have done that if he was really going to get nabbed. But he is most definitely not. Our CBI is smart enough to get Chidambaram and all, but not him? Please.

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

AskIndia,"[AskIndia]South Indian Supporters of RSS, why do they believe in Hindutva?",23,awasht,OmegaMaleX,101,"AFAIK Hindutva/RSS's idea of Nationalism stems from the European idea of Nationalism and not the Gandhian one. RSS hasn't adjusted its core ideology to be ethnically inclusive, instead it doubles down with Hindi as a National Language and a North Indian cultural soft power(TBF these issues always plagued the Central Govt but it feels like Hindutva ideology is adding jet fuel to the dormant embers of Hindi-Hindu Majoritarianism).

I find it baffling to see a lot of South Indians on Social Media vociferously supporting RSS. In a Hindi-Hindu Rastra they are ethnic minorities with second class status. And the fact that many of the RSS leaders believed(still believe?) in Aryan/Dravidan dichotomy just cements this idea. I just don't see them being anymore inclusive towards South India than they are towards non-Hindus. Which begs the question, why is there even a single South Indian Bhakt?

**On a Sidenote**: Has the Gandhian idea of India failed? Everything is so hyper&jingoistic these days. A mere mention of ethnic groups existing in India seems to trigger outrage&accusations of anti-nationalism.

AskIndia,[AskIndia] What song is this ?,7,comakt,lockworm,6,"Often when I think of home there is a particular Hindi pop a song plays in my head that was popular in the early 2003, the year I left home. I can recall only one line from the song and hum the tune of the same bit and nothing more. Over the years, I, for the life of me can't find the title of the track or singer. I've trawled through a several 2000s pop songs compilation on youtube, lyrics websites without much luck.

What I can remember: 

* **Genre**: Hindi pop song
* **Singer**: Male, lean and tall (at the time of filming)
* **Year**: 2003 or 2001 (A ""hit"" song during the month of CBSE board exam)
* **Lyrics**: (Not chorus) It goes by *kore kagaz ki tarah, adhoori (khali?) meri (hamari?) kahani hai* the next line is sung in the same tune. That is all I can recall. 
* **Music Video**: Filmed indoor with large open space, maybe just walls (dark) in an open field with no roof. Heavy wind blowing into the singer's face and all over the place (as you do). The singer wears sunglasses (totally unnecessary), dressed in black and he features in most of the video. He is stood in front of the car on occasions. The whole video has a dark blue hue and borderline black and white. 

That's all I can remember unfortunately. Frustratingly the song has been on the tip of my tongue for a fair few years and with every passing year it gets harder to bear the fact that I may die (not terminally ill) without ever being able to listen to this song once more. 

**TLDR**: Can't bear the fact I may never be able to find the song that reminds me of home and childhood memories.

Non-news should be a thing in today's world of instant news and instant shit. Sanity in this insane world that we've never imagined we'll ever be is non-news. And it should be yesterday because you've been through it and it's fresh in mind. I'll go first.

1. Yesterday I saw three donkeys after a very long time. I used to see and hear them almost everywhere. They've become a rare sight while I am growing up. They look old and don't look like they are in a good shape.
2. Yesterday I thought for few minutes why wasn't I am seeing monkeys in my neighborhood? They used to be everywhere in my childhood. That once again reminded me of a video made by one History professor on Pigeons in US. In early 19^th century 
2. Yesterday I watched a video on retrograde motion of Mars ~~mercury (and also sun)~~ again after a very long time. This time around I really wondered what it takes to observe such a motion. 

    a. First, curiosity of what's out there in the space; instead of just ignoring because it's been always there and can be seen everyday.

    b. Keep seeing one specific part of space, notice a specific object in the sky

    c. Identify the same object the next day

    d. Notice that that specific object has shifted it's position in fucking space and not a coordinate plane.  mean, you've got to have much more than a photographic memory to keep track of location of an object in space

   e. This comes before (d). The idea that I should keep track of it's location when you never knew it could move around/rotate/revolve.

    f. And the notice that the movement is strange. How many of us (in India) would do this in 21^st century? Apparently, this was observed by Greeks back in ~ 200 BC.
   
4. One auntie got mad at her husband/children and was screaming and shouting in no particular direction for a long time, even after they're gone. It seemed to stop at lunch time
5. I thought I should try making dosa using Chik Peas (Channa?) Yesterday I made batter and today morning I tried making dosas. It was a disaster. Was able to make just one dosa and it did taste dammed good. I am trying to make idli with the rest of the batter. It's work in progress.
6. All of a sudden Elpy mode is freezing my emacs. Need to find out why soon. I can't stand a monster memory guzzler Intellij.
7. Yesterday I bought 1KG really good tomatoes for 11 bucks.

AskIndia,"[AskIndia] Guidance regarding DTU, NSUT & IGDTU",14,cdeteu,poco_gamer,12,"*I have already posted this query on India_Academia but haven't got any reply. *

Hello all, My sister got a 49,000 rank in JEE Mains with Delhi domicile. She has got MAE in IGDTU till Round 1, but hasn't been upgraded till Round 3. Our options below in order of choice filling - 

1) IGDTU - ECE Electronics - I was expecting her to get this till round 3 but haven't till now, so a bit worried

2) NSUT - MPAE Manufacturing Process & Automation Engg - Very difficult to get considering last year cutoffs - may get only after Round 4

3) DTU - MAM Mechanical & Automotive Engg - May not get - high cutoff

4) NSUT - BT Biotechnology - Not a lucrative branch, but I have preferred it over other slightly better or similar branches of DTU because of lesser number of students (= better chance of getting placed)

5) IGDTU - MAE Mechanical & Automation Engg - Allotted

6) DTU - PIE Production & Industrial Engg - All of below branches are almost alike in placement scenario as all of them have very less/poor Core placement options. Students from these branches either go for Software, other Non-core profiles, MBA or MS. 

7) DTU - Civil

8) DTU - EP Engg Physics

9) DTU - Polymer

10) DTU - ENE Environmental Engg

11) DTU - BT Biotechnology

Of late I have been thinking if we should prefer BT, Polymer from DTU (far better college than IG) over MAE (better branch than BT) from IGDTU. I myself am from an IIT but from Civil branch and couldn't get a placement from campus. So I would totally prefer a better branch in place of better college but MAE is not an exceptional branch either. And she won't get IT in IGDTU either. 

Q1. Should I move DTU branches above MAE from IGDTU?

Q2. Considering no. of students, should I keep NSUT BT above DTU branches?

Q3. I have read some post on quora stating that NSUT is better for circuit branches, and DTU is better for rest. How true is that? 

Q4. Is ECE at IGDTU good enough? (if she gets it in further rounds)

Kindly suggest edits to the above order.

AskIndia,[AskIndia] How is your Jio Gigafiber connection,9,bysss1,darkknight42062,23,"Boyyo, the shittiest connection on planet Earth and it hasn't even been 24 hours of me using it. Leaving all the privacy concerns aside and various technical concerns aside like IPv4 to IPv6 migration (that has been covered in detail in a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aeblpo/r_please_dont_get_jio_gigafiber_and_i_have/?st=jwpse9tu&sh=4ffb9a21) ), I want to delve into the more mundane or trivial shitty things that come along with Jio Giga connection  

1) what the hell is with the landline, how could anyone be stupid enough to connect the landline with the router, fuck i have to keep the modem switched on a 24*7 or no landline connectivity. these fucktards ever heard of overheating  

2) of course the landline connection is itself a pain in the ass. fucking takes too long between consecutive rings, one might think it even got disconnected after the first ring  

3) the shitty shitty whyphy, motherfucker i want to kill the salesman who said i would be getting 50-60 mbps, the speed that i get is even lower than their low speed data that should be around 1 mbps, fucker reminds me of the gprs/edge days which still might be faster because of low data requirement for the page  

4) the stupidest and tardiest customer service ever, first you have to wait a whoopass 20 fucking minutes on the phone listening to the fucking jio tone or whatever, if that doesn't fry your brains, then the customer service guy/gal will. they are the fucking most typical indian customer service guys you can imagine. For a moment I thought i was in the south park episode with customer support and the vr headset. If you have seen Kenny's and kanan's maa ki dal sketch, then this guy is even worse than kenny. the same guy is the customer support and the floor manager and the technical team and yet they don't know shit  

enough with rant, i had some question for my borthers who got baited  

 * if any jio gigafiber users have figured a workaround for the landline, do tell mate  
 * how is your wi-fi speed, please tell me it gets better  
 * and yes any data hoarder or torrent user, does gigafiber have port forwarding, i have made all firewall exceptions, enabled upnp and still not able to open a port  

edit: i mentioned port forwarding in the last line incorrectly, i wanted to know about upnp support on jio, cause  with most CGNAT enabled isps, asking for static ip's becomes costly, so i had been using upnp to seed which can be easily enabled on the modem webpage. previously i had been using airtel and they had this service, what is the case with jio?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bysss1/askindia_how_is_your_jio_gigafiber_connection/
AskIndia,Fuck all Religion,17858,f9outu,pking3,4202,"Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christianity, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

AskIndia,[AskIndia] Situation with parents - Am I wrong?,62,as8cj5,yellowledbetter07,43,"27/M/Mumbai/Single/Only Son. Working a decent corporate job. I make \~14LPA. My parents are now retired. I've lived with them my whole life.

&#x200B;

I've had a good upbringing but my main problem has been that throughout my life, my family has been a group of over-thinkers, which has caused anxiety in me (and I'm sure in them) over things like ""What will you do?"" ""What if this?"" ""What if that?"" in every social, career, relationship position possible.

&#x200B;

Till they were working, this was fine, but ever since they've retired, they are finding it tough to deal with such situations. They have a good networth, we own 3 properties (live in 1, rented 1), they have a good corpus in the bank and they've invested money in good mediums. We are debt free. They feel they will run out of money, inflation will eat them up, they won't have food in their old age etc. This leads to fights daily among my parents and I am in the middle of the it playing the referee. In their fights, they demean each other calling out each other's weaknesses and failed ambitions in life. I felt this would happen a few days after retirement, but it's almost been a year now and it's non-stop.

&#x200B;

I do contribute to the house here and there but I feel that it'll hurt my father's ego if I start paying for household expenses. My father restricts a lot of travel to other cities citing expenses. My mom tells me in her fits of anger to ""pay"" for her to travel to other cities. I have volunteered but never followed through cause they never decided to go anywhere. **Are they waiting for me to take initiative / is their ego stopping them from asking / will I hurt their ego by paying?**

My mom has to feel in control of the house. With the timings of the maid to the food brought into the house. Even on the ocassions that my parents are back in their village for a week or two  - it's non stop. She cannot let go of things. **Does she feel she will lose control of the house if I take care of things?**

&#x200B;

There's a fight every second week over something or the other and the parents are not on talking terms for days. They had one today morning as I came to office. **Is this normal?**

&#x200B;

Now, this is leading me to a situation where I am :

1. Worried to make any big spends of my own and having the independence to do so - be it a trip with my friends, maybe a property on my name etc. How do I tackle this when it comes up? I don't want to be in a situation where my mom is like ""we aren't taking that train trip but you are going on joytrips with your friends?""
2. If I get married and live with my parents (Which my mom pretty much expects me to) will this be a conducive situation to start off my married life?  Specially with their fighting and all. How do I draw the line and be clear without hurting their feelings?
3. Has anyone moved out of their parents' house with some level of resentment (before or after marriage) and kept good cordial terms with their parents?
4. I feel a bit burdened and tied down in my house cause of few of the things here and otherwise. I am not always the happiest person when I get back home and look forward to office even though it's dull at times. Is this normal?
5. I have thoughts of getting a new job in another city and moving there alone and starting afresh (easier to change cities than get another house in the city). Is this okay? Does this make me a horrible child for abandoning 60 year old parents at home after retirement?

&#x200B;

Any other general pointers would be appreciated. Thanks in Advance.

Troubled, Yellow!

Took 5 years to complete my computer engineering in 2017 with 59%, jobless since then. Have no more interest in getting a job, learning or living.

After graduation, tables have turned. Parents say I am a big burden, nearing 25. Dad is behaving a bit weird mentally. Mom is stressed by her office work. Everyday I wake up to the same routine, just lying in the bed, pretending to find a job, avoiding parents and friends, I use laptop and smartphone the entire day.

I have one more month till my parents kick me out from the house. I have tried reforming myself multiple times, but after every 3rd or 4th day, I come back to my old habits. Put a lot of weight after I graduated.

- She could continue in Civil - get through IES

While I expect most people to complain about merit or whatever. I'm wondering about people who can think past that. Yes, it will mean women will be set up as puppet candidates, but then men are set up as puppet candidates all the time. So we arent losing on anything.

AskIndia,"[AskIndia] Otaku (and otherwise) of /r/India, what anime are you watching and why do you like it?",16,am16yk,EverydayGravitas,47,"I love anime. I think I can speak for many when I say that it's what I turn to when shit gets dark. Looking back over a decade, I can see that as long as I've been depressed I've had some anime to turn to on the side. 

I've never really become an Otaku though the last year has been tough and perhaps I've been on the path, as a NEET of sorts. Either ways, I felt there would be some here who would empathize.

One of the challenges of discussing anime is that everyone has their own personal list of must-recommends, and not many seem interested in your own lists. I guess it's like YouTube, everyone has their space and curations.

I've just started watching EVA. It feels nice to go back to the 90s for a change. And while I always perceived this as a 'weeb' anime for some reason, I watched a few YouTube videos on why people love it and realized it's sort of about depression as well. Four episodes in and I can see how compelling this show is.
 
The last anime I fell in love with was Samurai Champloo (which introduced me to Nujabes and the genre that evolved to become Low Fi). I watched that show for the music and the smooth storytelling. I wanted to be like Mugen - badass hardened street rat who's seen the world and is wise to it. But also like Jin, someone who has a deep inner calm. And a bit like Fuu, who creates the adventure, and who knows it's about the journey over the destination.

Starting a thread for people to talk about the anime they watch and how it makes them feel. Like, for example, why do you watch shonen anime - and do you feel it's inspired you to make your lives better?

More than plot and animation, I think anime does something for people's souls.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/am16yk/askindia_otaku_and_otherwise_of_rindia_what_anime/

Thanks to a rough 25 years despite being in a good place relatively in life I have high amounts of repressed anger.



Basically I was bigger than most (6'3"" and confident as fuck) so I was made to be feel ashamed of my size by everyone which led to low self esteem, and everyone loved bullying someone bigger than them so even when I grew up Everytime I was bullied I never used force and sucked it up.




How to release this anger in a healthy way? I've tried sports, gym, everything. I want to be emotionally stable and healthy before I start a new job so I really want to know if someone successfully relieved of their anger.

AskIndia,[AskIndia] Need career advice from complete strangers.,13,b8u3xw,toitsmort,15,"Hello, I am your typical engineer wanting to do an MBA.
As of now I have two years of workex, and an acceptance from a top 10 MBA college (1.6LPM Hojaega in a few years). My father however has his own project management consultancy, and is suggesting I join it.
I enjoy the consultancy bit, and the engineering part, but it doesn't pay as well as a Top MBA job would. So now I am confused, primarily because :
1. Dad's company = My company, plus staying at home (I've had loneliness induced anxiety before)  is a big thing.
2. MBA has a huge loan attached (25L+interest) which I need a lot of time to pay off.
3. Even if I stay home, I'll have to get some specialization in my field of engineering. So more padhai, along with work.
4. I can always work and make the consultancy bigger, expand it. 
5. From various people that I've talked to, once you're making good money, it's difficult to come back and start working for yourself.

AskIndia,Why doesn't the locked Mukesh Ambani page on Wikipedia have a controversy section? [AskIndia],177,a00x4g,Top-_-_-_-_-Secret,41,"This is the Wikipedia page for [Mukesh Ambani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukesh_Ambani). It is locked, fairly simpering in nature, and lacks any controversy section.

The equivalent entry on [Dhirubhai Ambani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhirubhai_Ambani) is not locked but is also fairly blank in its description. 

Wikipedia is supposed to a neutral entry for human knowledge curated by the community. In instances where an article is repeatedly vandalized or at constant risk of vandalization, it can be expected to be ""locked"" from edits that are not approved by a higher power.

I'm not the first to mention this. One Quora user (in a post titled ""How corrupt is Mukesh Ambani?
"") described his attempt to edit the page and how it was stumped by higher-level editors.

In the case of India's richest and most powerful person, it is understandable that certain information is undesirable in the public realm. However, that does not mean we should bow our heads.

Finding out anything about the Ambani's is notoriously difficult. Sure, you could follow newspaper headlines over the least few years but they have a tendency of being fickle. Remember when Ambani's kid mowed someone over in an Aston Martin? Or when the family was involved in a [bitter feud](https://www.indiatoday.in/magazine/cover-story/story/19890831-bombay-dyeing-reliance-feud-ril-executive-arrested-on-charge-of-conspiring-to-kill-nusli-wadia-816444-1989-08-31) with Nusli Wadia (that culminated in a murder charge)?

The saga of Ambani is too vast to remember everything. Only a person who reads the paper every day for the last 75 years will know their true history and even then he knows just a fraction. I admit, I don't know enough. But I do know that there is a concerted attempt to control information about Reliance.

We see it in [Reliance ownership of the media](https://caravanmagazine.in/vantage/the-big-five-the-media-companies-that-the-modi-government-must-scrutinise-to-fulfill-its-promise-of-ending-crony-capitalism), in their purchase and regulation of our satire ([they even bought out FakingNews.com](https://www.medianama.com/2013/05/223-firstpost-fakingnews/) in its early days - understanding early that such sites could be far more critical than investigatory journalists and far more apt as well). We see it in [near billion dollar](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/rafale-row-anil-ambani-files-rs-5000-crore-defamation-suit-against-national-herald-congress-leader/articleshow/65546040.cms) defamation cases. We see it when books that try to tell this story [are banned from being published in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Polyester_Prince).

You know what is happening. I know what is happening. We all know it. Anyone on the street will tell you this and that about how Ambani pulls every string. And I will be the first to be realistic. 

**However, an open ledger of information does not have the same weakness as a media organisation that has to pay salaries.** 

Use a proxy and edit. Cite your sources well. What are you doing wrong when it is done in the name of the truth? But before this can even happen, don't we need to get past that lock?

To get an edit made through a semi-protected article, you need to propose an edit on its talk page. 

Honestly, if I knew enough and wasn't afraid myself, I'd make the edits. But I think there might be smarter and better people on here who could give me added perspective. I don't have experience editing Wikipedia and I believe in this happening to a fair standard.

But on the other hand people living in India itself seem to give zero shit about following any traffic rule whatsoever. I have even come across people who on being asked to put on the seat belt reply with 'There's no traffic police in this area, so it's alright'

Isn't the entire point of having traffic rules to avoid accidents and major delays in transportation? And yet everyone seems to be completely oblivious to this and then start cussing at random people with their arse seated in the car wondering how it happened in the first place. Literally no one is exempt from this phenomenon - rickshaws tuck themselves in everywhere, bikes try to slip between vehicles, almost all car owners leave little to no space between consecutive vehicles.

No one seems to grasp the concept of staying in their own lane, if people were caught breaking the signal or speeding above the allowed limit everyone would get stopped one by one - it's just a crazy shit show. I have had several occasions where I had to personally point out to the traffic police themselves that vehicles are breaking the red light while I was crossing the road. Am I really expected to be okay with this?

You can say that many youngsters are to blame, but I don't see any elder people following a lot of rules either. It's only when someone goes through a major accident themselves, even after which they will follow only certain rules selectively so as to avoid harm to self.

I've received this information about him in an email. He's a long lost friend of mine, a good one and he reached out to me as it appears he's all alone now and even his family disowned him.

I am planning to meet him in person shortly and see what I can do. Can you guys help me?

First time I've joined this sub, I do remember seeing de-addiction section on the right but I don't now. Can you guys tell me what it entails? Hospitals/Rehabilitation centers, duration of treatment, approximate costs. It would help if it's in WB OR AP (Vishakhapatnam/Hyd/Vijaywada/Tirupati or even Chennai).

I've seen in one of the episodes of ""Homeland"" the protagonist is administered an African herb called ""Ibogaine"" and according to the show he was able to recuperate quickly. Any information on this also helps. I am mostly planing to bring him to me through the treatment unless he has any specific objection. If possible I am not averse to flying him to any place (i.e. if it's in Africa) that can offer some radical treatment.

Am a bit short on time atm. Need to run few errands. Can you guys help in anyway of information? Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a8ipdj/askindia_i_found_out_that_one_of_my_friends_is_an/
AskIndia,[AskIndia] How do you determine where you're from?,27,atfbl1,UngilUndy,20,"""Ninalle nataliya evede?""

""Where is your native place""

""Where are you from?""

These are common questions but I have no answer to it. I grew up in a different country, had my schooling in a different city, have my parents from two different parts of Kerala and have my (recently) permanent address in a different city.

I could say I am from the city I live in and have my family home in, but I've not lived here more than a year and know nothing about it. I could say I'm from the city I was born in , but again, I know nothing about it. When festivals happen here, I see them for the first time. I don't have any local friends.

I could say I am from the metropolis that I spent the largest chunk of my life in but then I am not Kannadiga.

I could say I am from the foreign country I grew up in and had my childhood from but then LOL that country doesn't give anybody citizenship. And I don't want it even if they paid me for it.

The more I think about it, the stranger the question of where you're from becomes, if you, like me, have no fixed roots. Where are you from if your parents come from two different cities? Where are you from if you spent many years in Bangalore but feel no affiliation to one city over another? Where are you from if you don't speak the local dialect and language of the place you are from?

inb4 ""I am from India"" because using that in a conversation is going to get you significant eyeroll. That only works on passport officers.

Journalist Priya Ramani first narrated her horrific experience with Akbar in an article and 8 more women came out against him.

After stepping down from the ministry, MJ initiated defamation case against Priya Ramani, stating all the allegations are false. The case is ongoing trail in the courts and Priya Ramani swore that she is not guilty and the allegations are true. 

I'd like to know what are the possible outcomes of this case. This case is against Priya Ramani and she has to prove her innocence aka there is no hidden intentions to malign MJ with the akbar, the allegations are not false. 

On top of my head, these are the possible outcomes I can think of.

- Not enough evidence to prove the allegations. Verdict in favor of MJ Akbar, Priya may go to Jail.
- Allegations are true. Priya not guilty, though nothing happens to MJ.
- MJ withdraws the case. 

MJ only targeted Priya and left others who came out against him.

An FIR has been filed against the Maulana & others and hopefully the police will carry out a thorough investigation and the Court will determine whether they've violated any of the laws applicable and punish them accordingly.  


Let's look at certain facts pertaining to the situation.  


1. Firstly, this was a 3-day religious gathering, between [March 13-15](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696).  
And this was much before the lockdown in Delhi (from March 23) & the Nationwide lockdown (from March 25).
2. The Delhi Government has alleged that the Tablighi Jamaat's 3 day religious congregation amounts to a violation of their [Order dated 13.03.2020](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696), which prohibits *""all sports gathering (including IPL)/ conferences/ seminars beyond 200 people"".*   
\-  Note that this Order was issued on March 13, the very same day that the event had already    begun, implying that the attendees were already in Delhi by the time the Delhi Govt issued the order.    
\-  Courts will have to determine whether the wording of the order *""all sports gathering/ conferences/ seminars beyond 200 people""* will cover this 3-day religious congregation.  
\-  [The FIR](https://twitter.com/DelhiPolice/status/1244983752314564608) filed also alleges criminal conspiracy, which will also have to be investigated and proved before the Court. 
3. So essentially, the legal process has been initiated against them. And if they did violate any of the existing orders or law in question, they will be punished.  
In this light, holding a media trial is uncalled for. We don't even have all the facts in the public domain.   
For instance, the [Delhi Govt itself blames the police](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696) for not having enforced its March 13 Order, given that the Nizamuddin Police Station is right next to the place where the religious congregation took place.
4. Further, a quick look at the general mood of the country as on March 13, points to the fact that concepts such as ""social distancing"" & ""self-quarantining"" weren't popularised by the Governments to the extent that we see today.   
For instance, as on March 13, the number of cases we had was 81, as opposed to the 2000 cases today, and addressing reporters, Health Ministry Joint Secretary had said on March 13 itself, that [coronavirus is not a health emergency & there is no need to panic.](https://theprint.in/health/coronavirus-cases-rise-to-81-in-india-govt-says-covid-19-not-a-health-emergency/380819/) 
5. A number of events took place between March 13 and March 22 ( Janata Curfew), followed by the Lockdown, involving huge numbers of people - religious places of worship with thousands of devotees, political events including toppling a certain state government, etc.  


While legal action has to be taken against people flouting the law, be it Hindus, Muslims, whoever, holding a media trial and bashing the entire Muslim community & trending CoronaJihad, does no one any good. In fact, it alienates the Muslim community even more & spreading more hate against muslims at large is irresponsible & criminal in itself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ftltyk/tablighi_jamaat_covid/

*Tips:*

1. Believe only the verified information from reliable source.
2. Be careful and alert in public, keep an eye out for sick, coughing peoples nearby.
3. Keep distance from people. Can be friends or colleagues.
4. Careful buying food, groceries etc. don't touch foods if you don't have to.
5. Wash hands [properly](https://www.who.int/gpsc/media/how_to_handwash_lge.gif).
6. Avoid Handshakes, Use verbal greetings instead.
7. Cough within [elbow angle](https://images.megapixl.com/1783/17830764.jpg).
8. Don't touch anything if you don't have to e.g. Bus, Train, vehicle poles and door handles.
9. Carry Hand sanitizer if you can.
10. Apply the sanitizer on area you touch like ATM, bus poles or other public used things you need to touch. ( little awkwardness in public is better than getting sick )
11. Non-essential gathering in large groups must be avoided. e.g. sport events, concerts, meetups etc.
12. Get more information from [WHO.int](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) or other verified research institute.
13. suggest..

*Thoughts:*

Personally called few numbers to correct the map address. Found out in gMap they had different names. So please check the map links and make sure you're going to right address. Before calling them do your research. ""Get  info"" calls can make a line busy and  real people in need suffers.

When calling few centers myself, a person received my call asking if they are the govt assigned center to test corona, he got scared at first just by hearing the name. Which made me wonder how less information he might have about the pandemic. I hope you get all the right information about this threat. Wash hands as much you should, definitely more. And please be kind to others, if you feel sick of corona symptoms please do not take it lightly. Get help, ask for help. Do use mask, self hygiene, self quarantine and don't spread. You might spread it to your family and friends first (the closest we get ) so most of all don't be a dick. We can fight this by fighting the urge to get close to people washing hands.

Sports,We are not perfect,607,e7s7rg,spacejesus01,380,"19(m) just an average boy in college with a messed up life..so the other day i overheard my parent's conversation about me where basically my dad went on to rant about how i have basically achieved nothing in life while kids my age(having no financial support)have done wonders. And I've come to realize how Indian society mocks and pressurize teenagers to be at the top while completely ignoring the fact that not everyone has to be perfect and there is no shame in admitting that we are full of flaws and I'm hope people come up with things they want to say about themselves not being perfect 

Here I'll start

""I'm  19  i cant even ride a bicycle and I'm afraid to drive and i literally do not like any kind of sports""

Edit : this post is not about me complaining or whining about my parents...neither is it about seeking redressal for being a failure in life(becauselets be honest we'veheard that crap a ton of times)...Its more about accepting the way you are because here in India every judge's you ..from you looks to your talents to your abilities....its okay not to be special because a large portion of people are above you...sometimes being bad at something everyone expects you to bd good at or something that everyone is good at and your not is Okay !!",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e7s7rg/we_are_not_perfect/

In IPL, ALL of them are european girls. 

Culture cant be the only reason. I mean in such a huge population, there should be some that are open enough to perform routines. 

Is it regarding attractiveness? Theres no shortage of bombshells in india, especially given the population. I would really love our beautiful brown women to take up this sport. Its a well respected sport in many developed countries.

But despite all the cultural history wrestling is not a sport ever present in Indian schools while American schools all have a good wrestling team with them.

My dad's a government officer, mid-fifties, earns more than a lac. He's the most hard working and disciplined person I have ever seen. He's in the government since his early twenties. He's just 3 years away from retirement. He loves reading and love making contacts. My mom's a housewife(mid-forties or late forties, lol I don't know her date of birth), she's sweet, lovely, caring and love making people happy. My sibling is the best. He's earning okay. My parents have raised me well. I'm glad I grew up in the nineties, so I developed a lot of interest in sports and played a lot of them at competitive levels. I had a profound interest in video games and computers. My dad bought a one in the early 2000s I guess, with Windows 95 on it. He used it for typing, there was something FoxPro thing I don't exactly remember he used to do. Then most of my 2000s went playing with friends, games, school, etc. It was real fun, to be honest. I cherish those memories, a lot. College was not so good, but okay kinda. I realized a hell lot in college, not the studies haha but a lot about me. I'm not on Facebook and Instagram, quit them already. In the past year, I've developed a rigorous thinking about work and how not to throw away your life. It's really turning good for me. I follow Angel co-founder Naval and like him a lot. He's a good man. All in all, I have my interests or niche that I follow. It's good to not be mainstream sometimes. I don't have a goal. The only thing I know is to work hard, improve my skills and learn continuously. I joke at people who settle down and say learning stops when you get old. I call bullshit. 

But I don't know how should I feel? Being in a country with people who are deprived of such things. Should I feel guilty or thankful? I would think, if I was born in a poor family, I would've been living a mediocre life, with struggling to survive. I think when I reach 30, I will be financially independent. Only dependencies I want are my parents and sibling. No external sources like marriage or some other shit.  They raised me right, now it will be my turn to be with them at old age.

First of all, it never remembers your video setting. No matter what you do, new videos will start at auto resolution which is probably 480p or lower. It never gets better like Netflix does, no auto scaling. The quality remains 480p. But then there's an override setting. You can select high and it will scale to full hd. But only for some titles.

For many titles, the quality gets stuck to 480p no matter what you do, no setting can override this. You can skip, pause but nothing works. 

So, is this problem only with me, or does anyone else see this kind of problems in their phone?

### 1) SARS-­CoV-­2 

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer­reviewed, open­access journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS­-CoV-­2, the virus causing the COVID-­19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-­2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

### 2) G20 Meeting in Saudi Arabia

* Recently, the ministers and central bankers from the world’s largest economies participated in the G20 meeting held in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia).
* It was presided by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the first Arab nation to hold the G20 presidency.
* The 2020 G20 Presidency will focus discussions, forums, working groups and Ministerial Meetings under the theme of “Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All”.

#### Key Points

* Global Economy:
   * The global economic growth remains slow and downside risks due to the geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty.
   * Though the economic growth is expected to increase in 2020 and 2021 due to loose monetary policy and an easing of trade tensions.
* IMF’ Views at the Meeting:
   * It projects a “V-shaped, rapid recovery” for the global economy, but it warns about the uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19).
   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

   * E.g. Judgement on Sardar Sarovar Project
* Increased Accessibility: The Supreme Court was hailed for the “extraordinary effort” to make its judgments more accessible to the common man by making them available in nine vernacular languages, keeping in mind the nation’s linguistic diversity.
* Gender Justice: The recent directives for granting equal status to women in the Army, guidelines for preventing sexual harassment at the workplace, etc. were appreciated.
* Global Reference: The Chief Justice of India said that the Supreme Court’s judgments are cited by courts of other countries and have served as a “beacon of hope” to independent and developing nations.
   * A 2001 verdict of the South African court cited the Indian case of Narain Das Jain v Agra Nagar Mahapalika decided by the Supreme Court in 1991 to benchmark the compensation to be provided while acquiring land.
* Use of ICT: The need for technology was highlighted to deliver speedy justice.
* The Government is making an effort to connect every court of the country to the E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project. The establishment of the National Judicial Data Grid will make court procedures easier.
* Future Challenges: It was highlighted that issues like data protection and cybercrimes pose new challenges for the judiciary.

#### E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project

* The E-Courts Project was conceptualized based on the ""National Policy and Action Plan for Implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the Indian Judiciary - 2005"" submitted by the e-Committee of the Supreme Court of India (set up in 2004).
* The main objectives of the e-Court Project are as follows:
   * To provide efficient & time-bound citizen-centric service delivery.
   * To develop, install & implement decision support systems in courts.
   * To automate the processes to provide transparency of Information access to its stakeholders.
   * To enhance judicial productivity both qualitatively & quantitatively, to make the justice delivery system affordable, accessible, cost-effective & transparent.
* The e-Courts National portal (ecourts.gov.in) was launched in 2013. This provides Case Status, daily Case-list, Cases Filed and Cases Registered through the Case information System (CIS) Software.
* The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is a part of the e-Courts Integrated Mission Mode Project. It was launched in 2015. The aim is to track judicial performance across different courts in the country.
   * The NJDG is working as a National data warehouse for case data including the orders/judgments for Courts across the country.
   * NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage & reduce pendency of cases.
   * It also helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delay and arrears in the system, facilitate better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, facilitate better resource management.
   * NJDG has specifically helped India improve its ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report.

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

### 7) World’s largest cavefish discovered in Meghalaya

A team of experts from the UK, Switzerland, and India have discovered the world’s largest species of cavefish in Meghalaya’s Jaintia Hills.

#### About

* The cavefish, similar in anatomy to an endangered mahseer species, is around one and a half feet in length and was found inside a remote cave in Jaintia Hills.
* The fish has no eyes and is white due to a lack of melanin pigmentation.
* As they live in a nutrient-limited environment most of these species are small.

### 8) Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* The State Government of Arunachal Pradesh intends to build a highway through the 862 sq km Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) in East Kameng district.
* The Government had in the past built a highway through the Namdapha National Park.

#### Key Points

* The project is named the East-West Industrial Corridor which is a proposed elevated corridor at the tiger reserve, to be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs.2,550 crore.
* The highway aims to connect Bhairabhunda in West Kameng district and Myanmar in Changlang district along Arunachal Pradesh’s border with Assam.
* The argument over an elevated corridor at the PTR was that it can ensure the free movement of wild animals.
* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state’s foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.
* The vegetation is predominantly tropical semi-evergreen forest.
* What makes PTR special are the brilliant efforts of the Forest Department and local communities like that of the Nyishi Tribe who inhabit the area around the park to protect the wildlife here.

Sports,"TIL: Record for highest attendance during a sporting event in India was during 1997 Federation Cup Semi Final between East Bengal & Mohan Bagan that witnessed an audience of 131,781 at Salt Lake Stadium, Kolkata.",44,dindz9,kash_if,1,"Most of you probably know that they are bitter rivals. East Bengal won the game 4-1 with Bhaichung Bhutia scoring a hat-trick. 

I came across this while reading about yesterday's match between India and Bangladesh where the attendance was 61,486. Probably one of the highest in recent times.

> It is to be wondered what would have happened if the AIFF, in a weak moment, reacted to Amal Dutta's suggestion that a foreign referee must be given charge of the match. And if the foreign referee, as Dutta wished, was a strict, unyielding man, the semi-final may not have taken place. For clearly, there were more people in the Salt Lake Stadium than the maximum meant to be accommodated when it was newer and in better condition. Instead of the maximum capacity of 1,20,000, there were 1,31,781. And the precise number mentioned by press reports lends belief that the figures had been given officially.

> Which means that knowingly, the AIFF and the IFA had allowed nearly 12,000 people more for the highly tense semi-final, an unpardonable excess. **The attendance set two records. One for the highest turn-out for any match, not only in India but also anywhere in Asia, and maybe anywhere in the world save for the matches at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.**

Sports,"17 y/o girl, wants to be a chef, parents stereotyping. [advice]",25,etpkb0,hojackthewhoresman,11," 

I've been trying to make a post about this for a long time now, i feel like i haven't found the right words.

Anyway, I'm a 17 year old, in a tight corner. So to give you a backstory, I love baking/cooking and people say i'm a very good baker. I'm also a tennis player (national level). And i do well academically. I've always loved experimenting with my kitchen. so naturally i wanted to be a chef. As a person into many things, i feel like I'm more comfortable with culinary arts.

And I've been trying to convince my parents to get me into culinary school. They are not obliging. They feel that their child is 'too talented' and that my 'potential' is being wasted on culinary arts. and they're being very stereotypical and telling me that i'll have to cook for my husband after marriage anyway. And that being a chef isn't a 'respectable' profession. This has been going on for around 3 years now and I've made them talk to people, showed them all the researches i did on culinary arts and the career i could make out of it. and all the colleges i could get into but to no avail.

Sometimes it gets hard. My parents aren't exactly the type that appreciates you when you do something big. They just ask me to keep pushing no matter what. That kinda takes a toll on me oftentimes. and they want me to pursue engineering. I mean I'm okay with it but its not my thing. Maybe they're doing this because of the sports quota. they just keep telling me that i should pursue a 'noble' profession and not culinary arts. either engineering or english literature/sociology and take up UPSC exams.

It feels like they're living my life for me. I don't wanna sound ungrateful i love my parents for providing me with everything but i feel like there's a hidden motive. like my dad enrolling me in tennis coaching at a very young age and he straight up admitted recently that he did it because i'd get into engineering easily.

And two months ago when i was on the verge of giving into engineering, i told my parents that i was okay with either chemical engineering/aerospace but that's when i realised that they were controlling even the branch of engineering i'm supposed to take. They were hell bent on me taking up csc/ece. so ultimately i started resenting them (not only for this, but for various other reasons too).

Each day it keeps getting worse and i wanna move away for college and take up culinary arts. but my parents are so against me moving away for college . but I'm pretty sure they wouldn't pay my fee if i take up culinary arts. at this point I'm willing to move away for college regardless of the course. I feel like my parents are being narrow minded, the person i wanna be is exactly not the person they want me to be. The amount of toxicity that my parents are inflicting upon me is immeasurable.

If you've ever been in this position / have a piece of advice for me, please comment. If you wanna know more about a specific part here, ask me. I'd be happy to elaborate. This is very serious and I'm helpless.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/etpkb0/17_yo_girl_wants_to_be_a_chef_parents/

Sports,COVID-19 - Information,1,fm9kmq,mohitkr05,1,"&#x200B;

These are the collection of data from various resources.

# Corona virus - What it is?

Novel - First time human immunity system is being exposed to this virus

Corona virus - Family of viruses with crown shape

**Symptoms**

Please **monitor your temperature if you have dry cough**. If you get high temperature & any of the mentioned symptoms in point 2, please seek medical advise. In a case, if you have sore throat , please practice social distancing and isolate yourself.

The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and  beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the  incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly  around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become  available.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are

1. **fever, tiredness, and dry  cough** (The AND is important point to note\*\*)\*\*.
2. Some patients may have **aches and pains**, **nasal congestion**, **runny  nose**, **sore throat** or **diarrhea (Apart from mentioned above)**.
3. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.
4. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.
5. **Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease  without needing special treatment**.
6. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.
7. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood  pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop  serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing  should seek medical attention.

**Spreading**

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose  or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.  These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other  people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then  touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if  they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or  exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter  (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

**Asymptomatic Spreading**

&#x200B;

1. If a person is asymptomatic, it is highly that he is not communicating the disease till he follows a good personal hygiene.

The main way the disease spreads is **through respiratory droplets**  expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from  someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with  COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the  early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19  from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel  ill.  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of  COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings. 

# How to protect yourself

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

&#x200B;

1. **WASH your hands** : Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
2. Maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why?  When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from  their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you  can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person  coughing has the disease.
3. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Why?  Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated,  hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there,  the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
4. Make sure  you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This  means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when  you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why?  Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you  protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and  COVID-19.
5. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever,  cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in  advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why?  National and local authorities will have the most up to date information  on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your  health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.  This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other  infections.
6. Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19  hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is      spreading  widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are  an older person      or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.
7. Self - isolation period should be 5-14 days.[Guidelines for Home Quarantine](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/Guidelinesforhomequarantine.pdf)
8. Please call ahead if you are visiting a doctor.

**Please make sure if you use mask , you know how to handle it. Incorrect handling and using of mask will lead you in troubles (touching front of the mask, not disposing it , touching mask again and again to adjust it)**

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially  coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable  face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after  someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide  shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.

WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks  ([see Advice on the use of masks](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks)).

The  most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are  to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow  or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from  people who are coughing or sneezing. See  [basic protective measures against the new coronavirus](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks) for more information.

Guidelines for home qurantine

## Recommendations for travelers

It is prudent  for travelers who are sick to delay or avoid travel to affected areas,  in particular for elderly travelers and people with chronic diseases or  underlying health conditions.

General recommendations for  personal hygiene, cough etiquette and keeping a distance of at least one  meter from persons showing symptoms remain particularly important for  all travelers. These include:

* Perform hand hygiene  frequently, particularly after contact with respiratory secretions. Hand  hygiene includes either cleaning hands with soap and water or with an  alcohol-based hand rub. Alcohol-based hand rubs are preferred if hands  are not visibly soiled; wash hands with soap and water when they are  visibly soiled;
* Cover your nose and mouth with a flexed elbow or  paper tissue when coughing or sneezing and disposing immediately of the  tissue and performing hand hygiene;
* Refrain from touching mouth and nose;
* A  medical mask is not required if exhibiting no symptoms, as there is no  evidence that wearing a mask – of any type – protects non-sick persons.  However, in some cultures, masks may be commonly worn. If masks are to  be worn, it is critical to follow best practices on how to wear, remove  and dispose of them and on hand hygiene after removal (see [Advice on the use of masks](https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1269003/retrieve))

As for any travel, travelers are also advised to follow proper food hygiene practices, including [the five keys for food safety](https://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/consumer/en/5keys_en.pdf?ua=1&ua=1), as well as [recommendations to reduce the risk of transmission of emerging pathogens from animals to human in live markets](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/who-recommendations-to-reduce-risk-of-transmission-of-emerging-pathogens-from-animals-to-humans-in-live-animal-markets).

# Actions taken by Gov of India

They also directed that people should be sensitized on appropriate use of masks, to be utilized only when needed and to wash hands with soap.

&#x200B;

### 6) What is the happiness curriculum?

On her upcoming visit to India next week along with US President Donald Trump, First Lady Melania Trump will visit a Delhi government school, where she will attend a happiness curriculum class.

#### What is it?

The curriculum is one of the flagship schemes of the Delhi government in the education sector launched in July 2018 in all MCD schools.

* The curriculum calls for schools in India to promote development in cognition, language, literacy, numeracy and the arts along with addressing the wellbeing and happiness of students.
* It further says that future citizens need to be “mindful, aware, awakened, empathetic, firmly rooted in their identity…” based on the premise that education has a larger purpose, which cannot be in isolation from the “dire needs” of today’s society.

 

### 7) The Sunderbans and Climate Change

* The monsoon in Sunderbans is likely to last longer and get more intense, according to a fact sheet titled The Sunderbans and Climate Change, which was made public during the ongoing Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.
* Climate specialists have predicted that as climate change progresses, monsoon seasons in the Sundarbans will become longer and more intense. Conversely, drought conditions will also become more pronounced, presenting further challenges for agricultural producers in particular and ecosystems in general,” said the document released during the Conference of Parties being held at Gujarat.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f87gi2/daily_current_affairs_of_23rd_february_2020/

Sports,Unpopular Opinion: Get a DTH if you are a sports fan in India,6,bmk8q2,hornybanana69,16,"Let me start by saying that Hotstar and SonyLiv have really bad quality, specially for live streaming. Their 1080p stream has really low bitrate and you'll notice really bad interlacing with really bad pixelation appearing every few seconds, specially if you have a 43 inch + HD TV. Literally any pirated 1080p stream will be better than Hotstar.

Now, people here really hate DTH connections and for good reasons, however those reasons don't apply for sports channels. You won't get ads in football, and you'll get ads in Cricket on Hotstar too. Further, the new TRAI regulations made packs costlier for those who want many channels, but really cheap for those who only buy it for few channels. You can just get rid of any base pack you're given, and need to pay a monthly fee of 153 rupees for Network Charges, and 23 rupees for Star Sports 1 HD and 23 rupees for Sony Ten 1 HD, paying less than 200 rupees per month in total.

As a person emigrated to Germany, I want to chip in my personal view as to what it takes to make me come back to India. 

tl:dr; I won't be back as of now! May be in future!

Long version:

u/ozonised has compiled very good list of what issues exists and what can be improved.

Infrastructure: I come from Hyderabad and being a capital city the infrastructure is shit! It took more than 10 years and massive amount to build a metro, and that too it's over the top metro not an underground. The roads are already congested and these fools installed metro pillars in between the roads, congesting it even more. The city sewage is still from the Nizams era and nothing substantial has been done to improve it. Every year in rainy season, roads and buildings are submerged in water.

Ride bike for one hour, take a clean cloth and swipe on your face, a black layer come off. That's the pollution in the city. Auto and public busses emit black gases from exhaust! You are literally breathing that shit day in, day out. Just creating better transportation does not make a place livable. You need to plan for the future and build something sustainable! There is no greenery in the city and becoming concrete jungle! Every year when I visit Hyd, I regret roaming on the streets because of that black smoke.

Please make the city more livable. Yesterday there was news about cutting down trees in Aarey park, mumbai to make way for Metro! We need to progress and build infrastructure considering nature not the other way round. It takes just a strong will to inspect/make every person riding a vehicle to follows correct emission standards.

Healthcare:  
Healthcare is completely different topic. Last year, as a challenge to get an MRI for my Cervical Spondylosis problem, my father asked me to get it done in Osmania Hospital. I visited for 20 days and tried to get an appointment with a Neuro doctor and MRI without paying a bribe, sadly I gave up and got it done in a private hospital.

Have you ever visited the pregnant ward in any govt hospital? If you don't puke, I would congratulate you. Imagine women carrying a child for 9 months and then delivering among other 20 women in a congested room and pathetic conditions. Healthcare is literally on their knees.

- Did you know 2 years back Indian mangoes were banned in germany because they were using chemicals to ripe them! 

You know what can be done? Just a good officer and good inspection to keep premises clean and healthy. Checkout the amsterdam cycling documentaries, the govt responded to the public demand and created more cycling infrastructure, so that people can bikle freely and resulting in massive decline in health problems.

Academics: 
The plight of private schools looting parents came to mainstream due to Delhi govt. Kudos to them for bringing awareness. Private schools are robbing and public schools are getting closed due to lack of funds!! Govt has no money to run schools but they make a 3k crore statue. I saw some days back in UP, a school was serving rice with salt as mid-day meal. Are we in such a fucking pathetic situation that we can not give a curry/dal with rice for our future generations? Don't get me started on quality of education. Why can't govt schools have English subject? Why do they have to teach only in regional language? I saw many govt school students under confident when they start college.

In Germany I can study for free until my PG. I can work under professors and also get paid handsomely if I do research. You know what, as a student I pay just 52€(4000 INR) for one semester/6 months and can take part or play as many times. Open the following link with chrome and translate it. https://hsp-hh.sport.uni-hamburg.de/sportangprogramm.htm. It would be mind boggling to know every student in the city can take part in so many sports. You would be overwhelmed when you see the sport infrastructure this country has! I have never played any sport except cricket and thankfully to Germany I played so many sports you can't even imagine and that too almost free! 

You can also take as many courses you want by paying 110€(8k INR) for 6 months. When you earn more then 2.5k€ every month 110€ for 6 months is nothing! Why would I leave this and come back to nothing, where I can get sick just by breathing that shitty air?

Policies: Check out the startup culture here in Berlin and Munich area. In India, we have so many IIT's and lakhs of students graduating every year. What is stopping the Govt from creating a Startup fund and make policies that encourage the fresh minds to create fresh Ideas? They have a startup fund and I guess it has gone to the wind! 

Me, My elder brother and younger sister all are CS students. We are actually working on our startup that would be headquartered in Germany and branch out in India. Do you know why? because we get better funding here and exposure is fucking awesome! Every city has Startup hacks/meetups/pitches! I don't want to start our startup in the red tape of Indian bureaucracy. To be honest, It's a shame that in a country like India, we are lagging behind in Startup world!

Employment: Better startup policies, better infrastructure, better education directly leads to creating more opportunities! No magic wand. I am in my 20s and working on my company, there are lakhs of people like me, but sadly working that shitty 9-5 job in some big company. Just look around and see the jobs created by Zomato and Swiggy, the cash they brought into market from consumers. Imagine startups like these on a massive scale! It would change the face of our country. Our economy needs to be more open and welcoming!

My brother used to work in East Asia and came back to India and he regrets every day. The daily commute, traffic jams, pollution is literally killing him. As the first comment from u/mrfreeze2000 says, ""There are two types of people who emigrate: better pay/lifestyle, and better work"". I Emigrated because of both. You know Its Illegal to make me work on Sat & Sunday. If an exceptional situation arises that I have to work on Saturday, my company has to get permission from Labour office!

- I get 6 weeks of Paid holidays + public holidays
- I can travel 27 countries. Just pack your bags and hop in your car. Los geht's!
- I get PR after working for 3 years or 2 years with German B1 certificate. No Shitty visa issues like in US of A. 
- I can become German citizen in 6-8 years.
- I can take as many sickness leaves i want. It's my right. I dont do it, just saying.
- If my wife is working and expecting a child, she gets 14(fourteen) months of paid maternity leave. As a father you can also take paternity leave.
- My whole family is covered under my Health insurance covering from fever to cancer. 
- Children go to awesome schools here to learn, they can take music as a subject or any sport and all of this is free.
- If I ever got fired, I get arbeitslosengeld(Job Loss money), for 1.5 years I guess.
- Better infrastructure, better health and Hospitals, better care, better money, better air. 

Lastly, I guess this was written by non-muslim person(sorry to bring in Religion). As a muslim myself, my father urges me not to come back to India ever, given the cancer that has spread in recent years. I have desis saying to my face anti-national or paki here in Germany and least I expect that India. I stopped going to Indian festival gatherings here because I fear some dickhead will ask why I came there and what is my intention. Some years back I could trust my fellow Indians and now I lost that hope. Just for reference check this tweet (https://twitter.com/rohini_sgh/status/1180165971006197765), this is the cancer our country has acquired! You don't know the humiliation we are facing these days. Every damn thing has been turned into whataboutery. The current regime spined the propaganda about minority appeasement? What minority appeasement, muslims situation is worse than SC/ST's and that too without reservation. 

Why would I leave all these and come back to India to suck all that shit? I love my country and think of it now and then, but do I miss it? Nah! Do I miss the culture? absolutely yes! Do I want to come back and live there? Nope. Sorry.

Edit: Thanks u/kash_if for the silver!

I feel people look at Indians as a commodity instead of as people. This is a bit of a rant, but I'll elaborate.

For example, before the last Cricket world cup, reddit cricket was awash with a few Footballers and athletes from different sports taking selfies with Indian shirts saying ""I support Team India"".

/Cricket was awash with fawning Indian fans. Granted, I know most will be young fans, but something didn't sit right with me. Its clear that these stars dont even know what cricket is, let alone there is a WC going on.... It was clearly just a PR Strategy. 
The similar thing was done by alot of companies when it comes to Bollywood.

I just found it soooooo patronizing and condescending. They know Indians would eat that shit straight out of their hands. The know quality doesnt mean anything but quantity goes along way. India has a very fad based culture. So consumerism of merchandise is easy $$$ for International companies.

I dont blame the companies, its basic marketing. I just wish Indians would be self aware and appreciate that these people dont give a shit about Indians except our wallets and want us eating out of their hands. We make ourselves look desperate and pathetic.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dncd9w/are_indians_just_a_cheap_commodity_to_the_world/
Sports,I(21F)Can't decide if my bf(28M) is showing red flags and doesn't respect me enough or if I'm being too insecure and not trusting him enough,30,dup4ed,sabthefabk,35,"Hey ladies and gentlemen!

I need some urgent advice about my relationship as soon as possible.I've been a member of this subreddit for quite sometime now,and I've noticed you guys giving awesome advice to eachother.

I(21F) met my boyfriend(28M) an year and a half ago.Basically,I signed up on a dating site for the first time ever and deactivated it within 3 days.He saw me on there and found me on facebook.We chatted for a bit and he asked me out.He's met my dad and I've met his mom and we are both serious about getting married in the near future.

So I'm from a South Asian Muslim background and he's from a south asian hindu background.He's not religious at all,I am a bit religious,not too much though,and the religious differences don't bother me a bit.

Last year,my boyfriend/s coworker/female friend had a bad date(she invited a guy to her place,got drunk,he wanted to have sex and she refused,so he left).She asked my bf to hangout with her at 3 am on the same night because she was upset her date left.He told me about this and went to her place,then they went to the beach.I got uncomfortable and asked my bf if I could speak to her.He told me I could message her on fb and I did,politely asking her about what happened that night.She got really upset,made a very racist comment about me to my bf and after replying ""Nothing happened.We just hung out.He's a friend of mine"" blocked me.Then she kept texting my bf to ask how I'm doing(my boyfriend told me).I asked him why he didn't defend me and he said ""I couldn't attack her because she is a girl.I didn't want to make things awkward at office"".

I asked him to please stop all nonwork related contact with her and he agreed.She's still following him on instagram though.

So,here's the thing.Whenever I've brought up any concerns regarding this relationship in the past,my boyfriend has done all he could to ease my mind.Recently,he made a new group of friends he plays sports with every weekend.They're all Indian,so my bf gets along with them really well.They've begun to invite him out to bars and nightclub parties almost every week now.Last weekend,they invited him to a bollywood party at a nightclub in LA.The guys went with their girlfriends,and my bf knew very well I couldn't accompany him since I live at home with my parents and I'm not allowed to go out to clubs and bars until I have my own place.He asked me if I'm okay with it and I told him to go and have fun.He then told me all about how his friends got black out drunk.

Also,Him and a good college friend of his vacationed in las vegas last year for a weekend.Before he left,he kept telling me his friend was going to hire an escort and visit strip clubs(bf said the most he'd do is probably get a lap dance at a strip club just for his friend).They rented a car together and bf told me his friend wants to pick up girls in the ferrari.Before he left I told him I'm not comfortable with these kind of activities but asked him to enjoy the trip.Once he got back I asked him about his trip and he didn't mention escorts or strip clubs.I asked him about his friend and he said his friend didn't get an escort.

My bf just told me yesterday that he's planning on spending new year's eve with the same friend this year in miami.I am very concerned because I honestly don't think this friend is a good influence.I haven't brought this up to my bf yet.

I've just been thinking about this alot lately.Do you think marrying someone who stays at their friend's place until 3 am at night doing sheesha/hookah and going out to bars and clubs and drinking until 4 am and vacationing in Las Vegas is a good idea?Is this lifestyle common for people in the United States?Am I being too conservative/inflexible?

Any advice,or your thoughts,anything at all would really help!

We move to countryside , same case, thousands of small plots of land that barely feed them, government schools that barely educate them, social welfare policies that are worth billions that won't even cover their most basic of the needs, huts built on millions of tiny plots of land that barely counts as a home, billions in medicine that won't even help curing most common ailments. Enormous quantities of ration that isn't even the fraction of what is needed, all of that because they are born in the wrong place, to the wrong families, in the wrong castes etc.,

It just crushes my heart seeing all this injustice being done, the resources that could be utilized properly, i am extremely disheartened watching all this guys, very very disappointed!

Of such Inefficiency in exploitation!! I mean what the hell are we thinking?? Wasting all that food on these poor people when we can use it for our own amusement! Like we could use it to make a sport where we throw it into a river or something, or just put all that on the ground  and dance on it, maximizing enjoyment factor! All that billions of dollars wasted on social welfare and infrastructure for these people, instead the boring shitshow that is where we have to watch these people slowly starve to death, we could use the same to build thunderdomes and arenas where we make them fight for a fist-full of food, but then kill them anyway! Instead of wasting all this electricity and technology  to apparently ""elevate"" these people, you know what we can do? GIANT MACHINES!! Machines that can use these people as fuel like in matrix, we can just hook these people as soon as they are born in to these machines with a very thick chord that connects them to the machine through their ass. We hook these people upside down inside these giant machines and mine cryptocurrencies from their butts!! Think about it, we can use this butt currency to improve our economy, place bets in the death matches etc!! Our country is going to be a 5 trillion dollar economy in a few months, imagine if only the select few of us could enjoy all of that!! We.. We could be like a self sustaining switzerland backed by ass crypto! 

I mean seriously think about this, it is a much more humane way of living for these people over whatever the shit quality of life they have now!!

Sports,Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Address,242,cnn6a9,swapniljadav,157,"Today was PM Modi's LIVE public address.

In the very beginning of His speech, He highlighted the role of Pakistan in sponsoring terrorism in the valley, quoting around 42000 lives lost since 1948. He seems quite optimistic about the move of scrapping Article 370 and 35A, which he hopes will bring prosperity to the region. With the scrapping of the bill, he hopes citizens of J&K will benefit immensely. He raised the following points to the benefit of the people of J&K:

Sports,Timing of Dhoni's stint with the army and Amrapali group Sham leak,682,chze6i,tchme_sensei,129,"Just going through the news and following cricket, I would like to put forth a timeline of events to bring about an unbiased conclusion, so here goes the timeline

- Dhoni doesn't retire post WC, this raises a lot of eyebrows - obviously he is 38, there are better replacements and this is the time to try out new players

- Statement from Rhiti Sports(Dhoni owned and manages him and other CsK) and later on selection panel that Dhoni would not be retiring and rather doing a 2 month stint with the army. Lot of people are surprised by this and don't understand the timing of this post WC.

- In the immediate few days after this,  Audit report of Amrapali group is analysed as part of SC case against the group. Audit trail shows a clear nexus between group and Rhiti Sports, where homebuyers's money has been siphoned off to his wife, Sports Agency and now news even linking the bcci head Shashank Manohar (What??)

- [Side Event] Byjus announced as new jersey sponsor replacing Oppo. No Tender or process for jersey sponsor had been allowed, but just an announcement of Byjus (of all companies) to be jersey sponsor for BCCI. 

## Conclusion

- If you read between the lines, this was a well timed move by Sports Agency or Dhoni to announce the Army stint before the Amrapali Sham comes out to the media. Also most likely the reason for not retiring so can still call a few shots if this goes south (refer to the ipl fixing issue). How far is the bcci involved is anyone's guess with their shady crony practices? 

- Just another thing to bring home the point is none of the other Indian player greats including Sachin, Yuvraj, Sehwag, Clean as hell Dravid, Ganguly have over courted as many controversies as Dhoni. The clout that Dhoni holds is enough for him to walk on to the pitch in IPL even if he was not the fielding team, nor batting and get away with 50% fee fine, that should tell you how muddy our cricket world is (Byjus and all the above). 

- Meanwhile the match starts on Aug3 and we all go India...India with ads of Dream 11 and Godaddy after every over, khelo dimag se my friends",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/chze6i/timing_of_dhonis_stint_with_the_army_and_amrapali/

I think the same for the US that doesn't currently pay as much attention to soccer or cricket.  I think the hegemony of basketball, baseball and football need to be challenged and I wonder if it is time for the hegemony of cricket in India to be challenged. 

Can't force people to like things but providing lucrative alternatives my inspire the next generations to pursue other opportunities.  One thing about the US system is that opportunities are available for educational attainment at the college level through sports and not just through professional contracts.

Sports,A guide to anti-particulate masks,55,dpa2c2,darthcarlo,18,"I live in Gurugram and it's that time of the year when the air's out to kill you. I see very few people using anti-particulate masks around me. Now, I don't know if that recklessness, ignorance, badassery or dumbassery, but I am going to build on a comment I made on an earlier post by /u/UndeniableDork and write a guide to buying an anti-particulate mask. Before I start, resistance or immunity to particulates or pollution isn't a thing. Don't be an unscientific dumbass. Protect yourself and educate people you care about.

Down below are the different categories of masks along with an example Amazon link for the class. I do not endorse any of these products. These are just masks I've used over the last four years living in NCR and I don't have any complaints regarding their effectiveness. All of these, besides the exceptions mentioned, have protected me from breathlessness, irritated throat and upper respiratory tract infection.

1. I see a lot of people using the green surgical masks that are used in hospitals. This **DOES NOT** protect you from particulates. It works for airborne germs and will protect you from that guy who'll sneeze in your face while commuting on metro, but it does little for pollution. Most of the anti-particulate masks listed below help with germs as well, but if you're in an elusive unpolluted town with job opportunities, you can just get these to protect yourself in flu season. Price: [Rs. 5 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/Filtra-4-Ply-Loop-Surgical-Face/dp/B00IIIKZK6/)
2. The cheapest anti-particulate masks are disposable ones that are sold in sets of one, three, five or ten. I used 3M, Honeywell and Dettol and they are all fine. I'm partial towards 3M and Honeywell because they have been making these masks and selling them as industrial personal protective equipment for decades now. Also, 3M and Honeywell masks sell well among the residents of other polluted cities around the world. Price: [Rs. 13.5 per mask (80% efficiency)](https://www.amazon.in/3M-9004-Particulate-Respirator-White/dp/B0146DETH6/), [Rs. 33.9 per mask (95% efficiency)](https://www.amazon.in/3M-9004-Particulate-Respirator-White/dp/B0146DETH6/)
3. The next tier is disposable masks with exhalation valves. The exhalation valves prevent moisture buildup inside the mask keeping is less humid preventing it from getting warm and uncomfortable. 3M and Honeywell sell these masks as well. Depending on the time duration you'd like to wear them and the amount of physical exertion you're likely to undertake, you'll have to get a mask with a single exhalation valve or two exhalation valves. Price: [Rs. 37 per mask (80% efficiency)](https://www.amazon.in/3M-9004GV-Particulate-Respirator-Mask/dp/B01LF2QMRQ/), [Rs. 127.8 per mask (95% efficiency)](https://www.amazon.in/Honeywell-Pollution-Foldable-Exhalation-Valve/dp/B01I9PVOPW/)
4. Then, there are high performance masks like the ones sold at Decathlon. You'll need these if you're planning to jog or cycle in a gas chamber. They also have dual ~~purification~~ exhalation valves ~~which are the main filtration component in the mask~~. The mask itself is reusable, but the purification filter must be replaced when you feel the air flow is getting limited. They admit more air flow than the ones above and they'll let you get more oxygen into your lungs while also blocking out particulates. *I haven't tried these masks and I cannot vouch for their effectiveness.* Price: [Rs. 499 per mask (Mask + Filter)](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8398131_sport-mask-light-blue.html#/254-), [Rs. 149 per filter (Replacement Filter)](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8397813_sport-mask-light-filter.html)
5. The most expensive ones are pretty looking masks like Vogmask and Cambridge mask that are made of cloth on the outside with a particulate filter inside. They also come with one or two exhalation valves. Some of these can be hand-washed an reused, but not with a detergent. Please remember that detergent fumes are carcinogenic. There are also masks with replaceable filters like the Decathlon one above. Some of these masks come with additional features such as activated carbon filters. These masks generally claim 95-99% efficiency. Price: [Rs. 299 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/PureMe-Reusable-Pollution-Activated-Filters/dp/B07KXMHNL7/), [Rs. 449 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/Tdas-Anti-pollutiion-dustproof-Washable-Reusable/dp/B07YCWT6JY/), [Rs. 499 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07NC8DW9Z/), [Rs. 2000 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/Dettol-Anti-Pollution-Cambridge-Newton/dp/B07JP8RBQ2/), [Rs. 2000 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/Vogmask-Noir-CV-N99-Large/dp/B01J6KOW62/)
6. Nasofilters are an indigenous (AFAIK) product that is a filter that sits at your nostrils rather than functioning as a mask. So far, I've heard mixed reviews about them. The issue is see with them is that they don't filter air that will enter your respiratory system through your mouth. [Rs. 33 per pair of Nasofilters](https://www.amazon.in/NANOCLEAN-GLOBAL-Nasofilters-Pack-Boxes/dp/B078X6YFC6/)

A mask is only as effective as its fit around your nose and mouth. Honeywell masks, in their product guides, have a good way to test the effectiveness of what your wearing. If your mask is sitting right, it will puff up a bit every time you exhale and collapse a bit every time you inhale.

EDIT: Some corrections regarding high-performance sports masks. If you're looking for a mask for a child or an infant, look for smaller sized masks since adult-sized masks do not fit their faces and can end up causing suffocation for them.

Get an air purifier for your bedroom. Sleep quality improves when the air around you isn't full of shit. If you're unwilling to spend money on an air purifier, you can buy a PM2.5 filter screen for your air-conditioner ([Rs. 350 for a pack of 2](https://www.amazon.in/3M-Non-Woven-Electrostatic-Purifying-Filter/dp/B06XY536LF/)).

TL;DR: Wear an anti-particulate mask, there's a mask for everyone whether you're a broke-ass student or someone who makes 1.6LPM.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dpa2c2/a_guide_to_antiparticulate_masks/

Basic information is that I've been preparing for JEE Mains exam but some problems have hindered my preparation and plan.

While preparing I couldn't ignore how flawed these institutions are, there's barely any research done, barely any breakthroughs in science, lack of innovation and a lot of it can be attributed to how these institutions take in students, the admission process is biased towards upper middle class and the rich, those who can afford the ridiculously expensive coaching institutions, the coaching culture is a demon in its own way and deserves a thread on its own but I'll keep it as straight and simple as I can. The admission process involves how fast you can apply the memorized formula to a specific type of question, it doesn't require you to approach the question in an innovative way which would force you to think about it.

I could go on and on about how the system is flawed, how they should introduce western ways to take in students which both supports extra-curricular activities, overall creativity, communication and sports.

No one or no party is bigger than the country and what it good for the future of it's people. Why can't we as citizens start getting more objective in our assessment? The best countries on Earth have the least amount of political polarisation as the people there only want progress.

##Summary

This policy is easily the biggest change to the education system since the old policy came in. It is in many ways, entirely unrecognisable, while in many other ways, simply formalising what was informally already done.

The first and biggest change, is that primary education, from ages 3-6, is now a formal part of school education, and public school must offer this. The second change, what goes hand in hand, is the abolishing of the 10+2 system. In many ways, the 10+2 system completely ignored the way a student's mind developed, and thus made for a poor learning system. The new system is 5+3+3+4. These stages are as follows:

- 5 years of the Foundational Stage: 3 years of pre-primary school and Grades 1, 2.

- 3 years of the Preparatory (or Latter Primary) Stage: Grades 3, 4, 5.

- 3 years of the Middle (or Upper Primary) Stage: Grades 6, 7, 8.

- 4 years of the High (or Secondary) Stage: Grades 9, 10, 11, 12.

The new Foundational stage, is supposedly meant to be ""age fluid"". Your age does not matter, as long as you are within the age group 3-8. The Policy recommends that during the foundation stage there should be no textbook based education, and instead play based and activity based education. It also emphasises on introducing a variety of new ""stimuli"" to force children's brains to develop in a holistic manner. These stimuli include : music (classical or modern, both singing and listening), art (regional, national, sketching, etc.), literature (folk tales, literature from the region, and national quality authors, both modern and classical). This is a massive departure from the present system, and the new emphasis on arts, is excellent. To add to this, a new bilingual policy is introduced. Students who learn languages are shown to have much better cognitive abilities than those don't so the new system makes all students learn 2 languages right from the start. One of these has to be the mother tongue, in order to preserve it. The other language may vary by region and requirements. The three language policy remains, and will be better enforced. The final changes to the primary education, is the integration of ""anganwadis"" into schools, and shifting them from primarily health workers, to full scale trained teachers, satisfying the needs of the students. The NEP requires the full development of people-skills, through a variety of things like weekly assemblies and daily show-and-tells. This improves the speaking ability, something that IMO Indian students have historically been terrible at. New extras include group reading of stories, learning morality and ethics (along with a proper framework), puzzle solving of various types, etc. to make sure a child has a significantly better development. Students who fall behind are not left out, instead the teachers are required to identify and help them, as studies suggest that students who fall back early almost never recover.

The next ""Preparatory stage"" lays emphasis on shifting from a more informal style in the Foundation stage, to a more formal textbook oriented education, in the Middle stage. It is a bridge stage. Please not that the policy emphasises that any and all technical education *must* take place in the native language (mother tongue) first. This is because students who learn in their mother tongue have a noticeable advantage over those who learn in say English. The policy also has a very good write-up on why the emphasis on English has hurt India a lot. The preparatory stage also keeps this focus on arts, and expects students to fully develop other skills beyond the ""textbook education"". The policy also demands the abolishing of the so called ""co-curricular activities"" instead integrating them into the core curriculum. This makes things like PE, yoga, art, music, a core part of the education. It also requires that every student specialise in at least one of these subjects. Another new concept here is the selection of the best students to help the worst students. The best students are selected by the teacher, and then become part of a sort of ""national training system"".

The third stage is the ""Middle Stage"". By this time, the student's mind would have developed enough. It is now time to start the fully formal education. Subjects start splitting from generic versions into more detailed subjects (like science -> physics + chemistry + biology). Students at this point will slowly start to also learn technical subjects in English. The idea is that students will be able to think in their mother tongue (which has a lot of advantages), while being able to understand and present ideas in English.

The fourth, and final stage is the ""High Stage"". At this point, students have developed a lot. Their mind now starts thinking in ""the bigger picture"" mode, and they can start planning for the rest of their life. In order to support this, students are now allowed to freely select courses and specialise. They are still required to understand and complete art courses, as this is paramount to their abilities, regardless of the final courses they choose.

Some important courses that come over the 12 years include : course on ethics and morality, Indian languages and their history and regional literature.

The next major changes come to the school management system. Schools can now form ""complexes"". A complex is comprised of nearby schools, such that each complex as a whole offers all of the above stages. Complexes are then given funds and other resources, like teachers. These resources may then be split up among the schools as necessary. This is important, because some types of teachers are relatively rare, and thus it provides optimal utilisation of resources. Sometimes other resources like libraries may also be shared. The exact details of what is shared will vary depending of the schools and their locality (population density, and ""backwardness"" of the population).

Schools also get a new level of autonomy, that was previously missing. Teachers are allowed to be the final deciders on the courses, and how they will be taught.

In order to improve attendance, the schools will do a number of things. Depending on the area, buses may be provided. Roads will be redone, so that transport is easier. Older students will be provided with free bicycles. The mid day meals will also be extended to offer basic breakfast to students. Adequate and safe infrastructure, including working toilets, clean drinking water, clean and attractive spaces conducive to learning, electricity, computing devices, and internet, will be important to provide to all schools.

To reduce inequality is a primary goal of the new policy. In order to do this, each school complex will have committee overseeing the demographics, and why students aren't attending. Specific groups called out include Muslims (for unwillingness to attend), and women in general. The policy requires that people of all castes and religions be integrated into the schools. The teachers are also required to emphasise on equality, by preventing acts that discriminate (e.g. not allowing SC/STs to sit with ""upper caste students"", etc.). The schools are required to join with the community in eradicating inequality. They are required to talk with parents and try and change their behaviour. This could be the groundwork to eliminating the reservation system. The policy sets the target of 2030, by which the majority of the students will be ""equalised"", not by pulling down the richer and higher caste, but by pulling up the poorer and downtrodden. Special Education Zones will be set up in disadvantaged regions across the country. The Central government will support extra investment and per-child expenditure in the ratio of 2:1 for each rupee spent by the State in these Zones. A special National Fund will be created specifically for providing scholarships and developing resources and facilities for students from Under Represented Groups.

The next set of changes are aimed at teachers. The primary aims are to improve teacher pay, and status in society. It recognises that teachers are already heavily burdened with a lot of work, so no government work may be offloaded onto teachers. They are also educated better, and stricter standards are set. Teachers are required to ""re-educate"" themselves by joining workshops, and the vertical mobility of teacher is to be improved. Teacher education will gradually be moved into multidisciplinary colleges and universities. By 2030, the minimum degree qualification for teaching will be a four-year liberal integrated B.Ed. degree that teaches a range of knowledge content and pedagogy.
Developmental opportunities, in the form of local, State, national, and international teaching and subject workshops, as well as online teacher development modules, will be available to all teachers. Substandard stand-alone Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs) across the country will be shut down as soon as possible. New teachers will have to register with an authority, and then will be quickly shifted into a school complex, for integration with the schools as necessary.

The next major changes comes to the testing system. The new system will be run by the National Testing Agency (which was newly set up in 2017 for entrance exams). They will be conducting the tests, and the new tests will be more like aptitude tests.  They will de-emphasise rote learning, instead encouraging an understanding of the subject. The policy claims that by 2020, all schools will have internet connected computers. It thus pushes for some degree of digitisation, by allowing for continuous evaluation through computers. Board exams in 10th and 12th are no longer. Instead we have exams in 3rd, 5th and 8th, called Census exams. The idea is to reduce the importance of Board exams. Teachers will also be more involved in the governance of schools and school complexes.

This policy also paves the way for better recognition of ""top talent"" students. For e.g. if a student is really good in Math, then they will be attending special summer schools to improve their performance. As already mentioned, top students are also required to tutor the students who are have a hard time coping. There is also a new emphasis on Olympiads. This should improve India's ranks in international competitions.

The RTE act sees some changes. It is now extended to the full duration of school, from ages 3-18. The RTE act itself will have to be reviewed, as the policy notes.

As for private institutions, there has been some misinformation. Private institutions will have to undergo some changes to have a similar system, so that they too can reach out to all students. The main changes are how fees is regulated. Fees needs to be rationalised, and can't be arbitrarily high. Once set, fee increments must go inline with inflation and reasonable increases, as opposed to random increases. Schools are also now required by law to be non-profit, and must be verified regularly by submitting all of their financial details. Private schools are also prohibited from having the word ""public"" in their name. So be prepared to see a lot of name changes.

Schools will now also be accredited and regulated in a slightly more free manner. However, they are required to release all details to the public. A framework and guidelines for ensuring school safety and security of children will be developed, and will be made a part of the eligibility conditions for a school education institution for recognition and registration. Every principal and teacher will be made aware of the provisions of the relevant Acts, Rules, Regulations, etc. relating to child rights, and what constitutes their violation, by including a module in the teachers’/principals’ education/training programmes and refresher courses. Self-learning online programmes on child rights will be developed for the benefit of students, teachers, and parents. Credible mechanisms for students to report breaches of their rights, and for appropriate actions to be taken against perpetrators, will be developed and implemented, in collaboration with local police. The Adolescent Education Programme and National Population Education Programme will be integrated into the curriculum of schools in a phased manner. (please note that Adolescent Education Programme is not sex education).

Also, in addition to all this, alternative forms of schools like gurukulas, patashalas, and madrassas will be encouraged, as long as they follow a modernised syllabus and are fully transparent.

The first changes will be implemented by 2020, with most major changes being in place by 2022. The first benefits will be seen by 2025, and by 2030, we should have fully transitioned, with all benefits in place.

##Comparison With the Current System:

The existing system failed primarily in 2 ways: Languages were poorly integrated, and many schools did not even offer three languages, as the policy notes. Hindi speaking states and TN were the primary offenders. Now all students are required to learn languages as per the Three Language Formula. The other way the old system failed was in testing. NCF (2005) laid heavy focus on eliminating rote learning, and in introducing a system where discovery based education was encouraged. The 10th grade NCERT textbook for science is a testament to that. Yet the system failed, because tests only cared about how well a student could mug up and vomit arbitrary facts. The new policy does try to fix this, but how much will improve remains to be seen.

The other more minor ways in which it failed was the integration of ""extra curricular"" subjects. Many schools actually refused to teach these subjects, considering them a time waste. The new system makes them a core part of the education system, so there should be an improvement.

Please discuss, and if you have any doubts, feel free to ask.

##TL;DR:

1. Learning to learn

2. Mother tongue as primary language of learning

3. Focus on trilingual policy, with English no longer as primary language

4. Equality of all students

5. Arts, Sports, Music, literature, etc. are all now of primary importance, and each student has to specialise in one of these, in addition to courses of their choice

6. Digital Education

7. Freedom of choice in higher stage of education

8. Board exams removed in favour of more frequent ""census exams""

9. Testing now to focus on aptitude and understanding, with more frequent tests, a la CCE under CBSE

10. 10+2 eliminated in favour of 5+3+3+4, with full focus on primary (3-8 years) of education",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwb5ao/key_points_from_the_draft_new_education_policy/

Sports,My assessment on Indian Olympics contingent,17,d7lsqd,gauravxm,13,"I was very excited about India's chances at Rio Olympics but sadly we were very unlucky there. I was very heartbroken after last Olympics. Been following Indian Olympics sports very closely for last 4 years and I feel this time we can genuinely finish with 10 medals (if we get some luck in our favour). Here are my predictions :-

1) Shooting is very unpredictable sport but this time we have many fearless youngsters who are performing exceptionally well. We should win more than 3 medals at least if all goes well. Our best chances are in events like 10m Air Pistol (both men & women), 10m Air Rifle (both men & women) and Mixed Air Pistol & Mixed Air Rifle team event. You can check performance of our shooting team here https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_ISSF_World_Cup

2) Mirabai Chanu is most certain to win a medal for us at Tokyo. At recently concluded World Championship she finished at fourth place with Chinese occupying top 2 spots. But in weightlifting, a country can only send one athlete in Olympics so that means Mirabai will be 3rd at worst. She is currently 13 kg ahead from her nearest competitor https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Weightlifting_Championships_%E2%80%93_Women%27s_49_kg

3) I think everyone here is aware about Sindhu's badminton exploits. So I won't explain too much. We can also win a surprise medal in men's singles.

4) In Wrestling, Vinesh Phogat & Bajrang Punia is most certain to win a medal for us. We can also win one or two medals from wrestling if we get a favourable draw. Check our wrestling performance from ongoing World Championship https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Wrestling_Championships

5) Amit Panghal is a favourite to win a medal in boxing. He is current Asian Games & Asian Championship gold medalist. He has recently won a silver in World Championship. There were 3 other Indian boxer who were in QF at world championship. I'm slightly unsure about India's chances in women's boxing.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_AIBA_World_Boxing_Championships

Outside of these 5 sports, we have half-chances to win a medal in few other sports like Archery, Hockey, Golf and Tennis. I'm not expecting any medals from athletics. Only Niraj Chopra can finish inside top 5 in athletics event.

This is my own assessment. Please tell me if I'm missing some other medal contenders.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d7lsqd/my_assessment_on_indian_olympics_contingent/

Sports,Do people get socially / personally alienated because they're not interested / scared of pets?,21,d94q1l,PuneriPerson,41,"Over the past few months (and over the course of the last couple of years) I have noticed that an not having an overwhelming affection for dogs, cats and all assorted pets is a rather significant factor in maintaining relations with friends and family, dealbreakers when it comes to dating and possibly relations too. 

[ *""i'm a mother / father of 2 doggos""* ; *""if there's a doggo in your pic i'm dating you and stealing that good boi""* ; **the evergreen classic** *""doggos over humans any day...""* ; *""if my cat likes you, only then you have my approval...""* ; the deluge of appreciation tweets & posts on Instagram / Facebook; now the rise in posts in this very sub over the past week and many, many more...]

Dating apps have women and men displaying overwhelming affection for their pets. I've personally been unmatched and (digitally) broken contact with on a couple of occasions because I straight up admitted that i'm not too keen about pets (specifically dogs). 

[that i'm kinda scared of dogs in general due to a childhood mishap with a pet dog is a whole other issue altogether - growing up I've managed to control my fear/worry and while I don't exactly start screaming when in close proximity to a dog, I do look visibly panicked]

i'm not exaggerating when I say a potential marriage alliance was completely nipped in the bud because of the fact that she had a tattoo of her pet dog and I clearly admitted that i'm not a fan of having a pet / pets in the future. My entire existence as a human being and all my joys and sorrows, education, academics, work experience, sporting and personal achievements were instantly invalidated in a flash - because of this viewpoint.

while I clearly and obviously do not have an issue with folks having pets at their homes and the visible rise of pet friendly public spaces. cafes & restaurants - any attempts at trying to meet at non pet presence(d??) places is met with a lot of derision and straight up hostility. 

I understand that folks with pets treat them as nothing short of family members - but their decision to stay away from actual human beings; avoid and have a low opinion of those who are averse to pets - is rather confusing and if I may admit to it - a bit hurtful as well. I've missed out on a couple of social & personal relations because of this and I really do think it rankles.

Sports,Bala movie: A mix of new and the old (Analysis),16,du8jny,nibirdeka,4,"I was expecting nothing from the movie Bala because of majorly 2 things. First, I had checked twitter and found people with negative reviews (well Twitter is negative about everything these days) and secondly I had to walk out of the movie ""Dreamgirl"". I like Ayushmann but I found ""Dreamgirl"" pretty average and the movie felt like a culmination of comedy circus scenes. Thus, I was sceptical.

I was totally wrong. Bala is an Ayushmann khurana trademark movie. Ofcourse the director Amar Kaushik and the entire cast are responsible for the success. But, this movie is not merely about a good script selection. Ayushmann did a marvelous job of a frustrated insecured bald guy. I could relate to his frustration. The portrayal is just too realistic. 

Now, directly coming to the themes the movie touches. (Contains Spoilers)

1. Insecurities - The movie uses Baldness (primarily) and dark complexion as insecurities people have and how the world is hell-bent on shaming them. It sees Baldness and skin tone in a completely different way. Baldness touching the masculine charm and skin colour determining the feminine side. It explores these two ideas. 

Another insecurity it explores is the millennials quest for an enhanced pseudo identity on social media platforms. Bala gets upset about his baldness because he thinks he is not presentable on Instagram and Tiktok. The material socialisation of social media where we long to get likes in our videos, intellectual brainstorming statuses and etc. Yami Gautam's character comes in the frame here as she is a viral star with modeling aspirations.

2. Status quo - Javed Jaffrey remarks in the movie, that looks don't matter for men as it is a patriarchal society and after marriage the girl has to stay with the husband irrespective of her choice cause she is now tied. In the marriage it constantly challenges this notion. Bhumi Pednekar who is herself a lawyer, encourages a women to leave ger husband who was justifying her husband's cheating because of her weight. Yami Gautam files a divorce suit after she finds Bala is bald and has lied to her about his hair. It tries to break away from the marital trap of a women. 

3. Religion - Bollywood has attempted to touch religion in films like PK, OMG! Bala's addressing of religion is inclusive. Initially it criticises Lord Krishna for beautifing a dark toned into a fair skinned girl. In the end it analyses the situation in a completely different way. Krishna was not trying to change her into fair skin, the Lord was trying to make her realise that she is beautiful. This positive interpretation and understanding of India's religious practices is commendable because many a times we associate reformation with total denunciation of religion. India's secularism has always been about plurality and not about separation of church (here religion) from the state.

4. Pop culture

It touches upon the pop culture that shames dark skinned women by mocking certain Bollywood songs. It doesn't resort to any blame game because during that time subtle misogyny was evident everywhere rather it tries to remind us how subconsciously how we have been indoctrinated with the thought that beauty means fair.

5. Staying true to yourself

Both the women lead are true to their archetype. Bhumi although felt upset as a kid when she was shamed for being dark, she doesn't let it affect her way of life. She finds social media irrelevant to project a different self and tries to live her life with her ideals. Yami on the other hand is a product of social media. She is aware of her ""beauty"" appeal and uses that to build a brand around tiktok (just like a modern day influencer). She herself admits that ""externalities"" is her way of life and without that she is nothing. That bedroom scene with Ayushmann was much needed because there's a nerd culture being developed which shames people too much. ( So, what if someone uploads a selfie or a Tiktok video? Can we just mind our won business if we don't like it. If one is self aware of their potential and knows the market, exploiting it through social media is not a sin.) It is still better than the hypocrite Ayushmann who tries to fake it. Yami is not faking it. She is aware of her ""externality"" aspect. 

6. Activism: The best cinematic aspect of Bala is that the movie is not preachy. It is subtle in its activism. It doesn't call any names to direct blame, it highlights the normalisation of practices. Like fairness obsession, body shaming and even new ones like social media's edited reality. It depicts the shallowness of being too filmy. Bala's need for gratification comes from the fact he wants to emulate Bollywood behaviour. 

7. High school nostalgia: Bala tried so hard to have his hair back is because of the appreciation he received in school. A lot of people are stuck in their school days because they had a particular identity in school. Some were good at sports but later ended up in a deadbeat job and in the case of Bala, it being the popular kid in class. People are obsessed with the highschool nostalgia as they want to go back to those days to escape the monotony that employment and real life offers.

The most important point: Is Bala a traditional Bollywood hero? Well, Bala has certain flaws. He is bald which the B'town hero rarely is. He is insecured. Our heroes maybe big time fraud in their films but they are never insecured. Bala is different to a Bollywood hero. Bala doesn't get the girl. He gets rejected by Bhumi as she is in love with someone else. Also, it doesn't follow the Bollywood style of falling in love with the second girl (read rebound) in movies such as Kuch Kuch Hota Hain. Yammi ends up divorcing Bala.

But, but it follows the conventional hero arc in the end. Because the movie is all about Bala's victory over his insecurities. It is about his catharcis which he has in his last ""fairness"" cream presentation. It is about his reversal of fortune from being an average comedian to a well loved one. He follows the athenian ideal hero in a way. (Except he doesn't visit the underground) Bhumi feels sympathetic towards Bala and fights his case (it initially felt like she loves him but benefit of doubt she was fighting for herself as well as she might relate to Bala's baldness in a way as she has suffered societical taunting for her skin tonned)

Bala might have deviated from mainstream Bollywood norms (althout it is itself a commercial movie) but it adheres to the policy of The Indian Hero resurgence.

Sports,Lifecycle of Indian Male,54,ce06hm,Minuteman60,56,"Day 1 – You are born. Parents are celebrating that you are male and even more happier if you have fair skin.

&#x200B;

Childhood – You are expected to go with the flow. You begin to learn the ins and outs of Indian society. Everything can be bargained for in the market and wild animals are everywhere. Creativity, loners, and independent thinking are frowned upon. If you get bullied, **IT’S YOUR FAULT FOR BEING DIFFERENT**. Anything bad that happens (poor eyesight, too short, too fat, etc.) is also **YOUR FAULT**.

&#x200B;

More Childhood – Your parents educate you on your background/culture and how it is the best in the world. In public, your family act friendly with everyone but in private they may make comments ranging from politically incorrect jokes to straight up racist statements. But it’s okay **BECAUSE YOU’RE SPECIFIC CULTURE IS THE BEST**.

&#x200B;

Teenage – The only thing that matters are grades at this point. Sports? Not for you. Music? Weak hobby. Art? That’s for transgenders. Comparisons begin with sharma ji’s beta. Pretty soon, you realize school is not about learning but regurgitating information in a short amount of time. Many people get good grades but few have any curiosity and even fewer learn good civic sense. Teachers are abusive but it’s **YOUR FAULT** because **ELDERS CAN NEVER BE WRONG**.

&#x200B;

More Teenage – You somehow get into college. Only options are medicine or engineering, otherwise you are out of the family because no one will marry you. You also realize that your parents don’t really love each other and try to emotionally blackmail you because you are the only reason they are together. Girls are to be avoided because they only want sex and are a distraction. Everyone (friends, families, distant relatives, neighbors) is in your business because **NOTHING IS PRIVATE**. You are responsible for family honor.

&#x200B;

Studenthood – You go to college. You meet many indoctrinated kids but join the crowd because who are you. You (or at least me) grew up with few female interactions and fail miserably at getting a girlfriend because you are too shy. By the time you get your act together, you are 22. At least you made some good mates.

&#x200B;

Adulthood – You become an Engineer or Doctor **BECAUSE EVERYONE DOES IT**. You probably get a job. A high paying job. It doesn’t matter how much you work, what you do, or if you enjoy it because only **MONEY MATTERS**. If you don’t get a job, it is your fault because you weren’t competitive in the rat race.

&#x200B;

Now you are expected to marry a women significantly younger than you, from a (very) similar background, is fair, very educated but also a housewife. **TROPHY WIFE**. You will be expected to live with your parents who will control your adult life just like their parents did to them. Your new goal is to get to America/Canada/UK **BECAUSE INDIANS BRING THE BEST CULTURE**. Even if you don’t make it, anyone who you know does is automatically a good friend that lives abroad.

Sports,Indian mentality.,2,egc01b,deathandparadise,0,"This is something that I wanted to get off my chest. India got its independence in 1947 but even now indirectly we are under the rule of westerners.

Let me start with education

Our curriculum is such that , innovation and creativity is killed, we are trained and educated in such a way that we can work under the huge MNC's operated by westerners. Individuality is killed and people are corrupted by the sheep mentality. Higher education is a big joke in this country, those who pursue masters and post docs are those who couldn't land a job(most cases). We still have the slave mindset within us , we want to work for someone, doesn't matter if you like the job but we will work to get paid.The syllabus was designed by the british and we are still following it.

Moving on, we have our economy,

India and Pakistan are the cheapest countries to live in this world, not africa,not venezuela but India. What this essentially means is that if you go to any other country with the same wealth you possess in India, you will become [poorer .](https://poorer.No)  No wonder Americans use Indians for cheap labour. Even after being the cheapest country to live in , we have so many living below poverty line which speaks a lot about wealth distribution in our country. All those who come up with stats regarding GDP, please lookup GDP per person because that's what essentially matters.

We call ourselves a secular country, but ram mandir dispute constantly made headlines. Let me be honest, I dont care about who wins regarding this, but was this really a priority, can't this wait until we have progressed in other important areas?, our healthcare is in such bad condition, the state of the BPL people are pathetic but they want to construct this temple now anyways? Im not asking them to build hospitals in the place instead of the temple, that's foolishness and makes no sense, why can't they spend on healthcare and education first and afterwards think about this temple.

The defense budget is 3.18 lakh crore ,great our army is powerful and is the second largest but what the government fails to realize is that the biggest war is happening inside India. We spend so much preparing for war with other countries that we fail to fight our internal problems. Why can't the budget for healthcare and education be increased by reducing the budget for defense. Now some might argue that countries like USA too spend large o defense but the difference is that they are already developed, they don't have much problems from within whereas we are still a third world country.

All those media hype surrounding how India is a rising superpower is complete bogus, they want us to believe we are making progress so that can make good use of our pathetic situation. The real rising superpower is china, just look at their technological advancements.  

Moving on, we have sports 

The most popular sport in India is cricket. Now let me remind you that cricket was introduced by the british to us and we still play the game widely while they have moved on other sports. cricket is the number one sport only in 2 countries , India and pakistan both which were ruled by british. We are indirectly still slaves, we play the same sport they gave us even after 100 years. 

Having a population of about 1.4billion, our representation in olympics wont even equal countries which have population less than 10 million. Thats how pathetic is the condition of sports in India.

People just dont care, dont watch and don't play other sports, we simply aren't told to do so and so we refrain from playing others, only if this mentality changes will we progress in other sports, we can't just blame the government for not funding, if people aren't watching how will they fund. 

Moving on, we have women safety

Women safety is a big joke in India, Indian culture teaches us to respect women but why is the situation so pathetic.

Clearly this is because of lack of education and lack of sex education.

We wrote kamasutra, but now talking about sex is taboo. Indian schools treat sex as a foreign topic and most schools just outright skips this topic. When you say sex is taboo, it increases the curiosity in the mind of people, people crave most what they don't get/understand and like adding oil to fire we have all bollywood movies objectifying women which corrupts the weak minded and thus they give in to their sexual feelings.  

Sex education is important to understand and control one's feelings. 

I created a Fake facebook id, with a woman's picture as the profile picture and I got 879 friend requests within a day, most of them being indians, and I got 100 pm's asking me for nude pics. This level of desperation will ultimately lead to them becoming rapists and [molesters. No](https://molesters.No)   wonder women dislike Indian men.

And finally I want to end with bollywood

Most of the actors are light skinned and have features similar to europeans.Almost half of the actresses are NRI who eith er lived in england or USA.

This clearly shows that we still subconsciously are being slaves, we consider light skinned more superior, we feel they deserve more respect and this mentality should be changed if we really want progress in our society.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/egc01b/indian_mentality/

I had posted a just few days ago on how investing heavily in only a handful of ""profitable talents"" viz. dance, singing, comedy and cricket; and media's blatant neglect of other talents might discourage talented individuals from pursuing their interests in other fields of sports and art. 

And today I read about these champions of indomitable determination. They proved how, despite their hardships, special abilities and limited support, one can make history. One must also applaud their parents and well wishers for truly believing in their children when the world generally looks down upon people with special needs & abilities.

Most of these sports persons will soon return to their normal lives full of obstacles. I only hope that these men & women of passion get as much support and nurturing as possible from the govt as well as the society. They made India proud. They deserve to be rewarded and rewarded well for bringing glory to the nation. And more importantly for bringing a ray of hope in the lives of millions of others.

Sports,People of R/India. Let’s talk about Narcissistic personality disorder and abusive relationships. I have put my experience here. Would like know other people experiences and how things went and how they recovered.,63,c3otkm,tez_launda,57,"  

A few months back I had posted a question on r/India to seek people’s opinions on their experience with broken engagement if they had any. In the post, I had mentioned my experiences of what happened in vague. 

Putting things in perspective, my engagement ended simply because I shared my past struggles and future career ambitions with my ‘to be wife’/fiancée.  Struggles were in general related to a sports injury, past relationship, career decisions. My sole motivation to let her know about few from past was, first that I was being honest and wanted my ‘to be’ to know me in and out before marriage. Practically speaking, if we can’t discuss our weaknesses, struggles, insecurities with our SO then there is definitely something wrong with the relationship.

Anyway, on my previous post, many people had replied. Most said that I had dodged a bullet while few held me responsible for whatever happened.

Now coming to present, I do have my closure. Moved on to better things in life. But the days and months post the breaking of engagement were really really horrible. A nightmare that I wish no one should go through.

What I realized after almost 5 months that I went through was Narcissistic Abuse. All the time I was suffering thinking that something is wrong with me and I am responsible for all the events. But it was the girl, my fiancée, she was a covert narcissist. They are the worst kind of human to ever stay in this world. This inference is not by me but by psychologists. Almost 4-5 months after the ending of engagement one day when I was simply browsing over the internet about abusive relationship, a word popped up, narcissism. It just struck me like a big slap on my face. The realisation came that what I went through were ditto 100 % match to what someone endures in a narcissistic relationship.  

A brief account of what happened pre and post engagement. 

It was simple case of arranged Indian marriage. Girl’s family were too keen for marriage. Initially girl presented her as very charming and was very acceptable with our match. Only issue with her was to take things slowly. I asked her why she is marrying me, she said I am honest mature etc etc and I have everything she wants in a prospective partner. Also, she wants to continue job, can’t cook, want to go office party and booze, support her parents financially, etc. I was cool with everything. I will even support your parents since now they are my parent too. 

But suddenly, after 2-3 weeks, slowly things changed. She slowly started avoiding any communication, started telling lies, blatant manipulation, showed controlling behaviour, became very passive aggressive. She would just give silent treatment out of nowhere. We were supposed to go together from our work city to our home town, get engaged next day and be back. During the whole journey, 6-7 hrs one side, she just did not talked to me. Just acted as if I have committed some crime. When I asked what’s wrong, she said everything is fine, I am just over reacting. She acted totally normal in front of other.

In the end, I knew something is wrong. I asked parents from both side to meet to sort our issue. Here is what she said or did. She said, I worry a lot, I take too much tension, I am a mamma’s boy, I work in a govt sector but she want someone in IT, I am 4 years older than her and wants someone of her age, I am immature, I am not fun, I am a nerd etc etc. She used my past experiences to spin it around as real issues. She blamed me of still having affair with my ex and blamed me of having physical relationship in past, she said I have very low confidence. Her father questioned my confidence and how am I able to do a job with responsibility. Her mother told that her daughter will love me after marriage if I make her feel safe. In the end, she compared me to a Karela (a very bitter vegetable which mostly no one likes) and said how can a karela be compared to mango.  She put a statement as her WA dp pointing towards me, “why so mean, coz I thought If I look unapproachable then you will not approach me”.

How I realised she was a narcissist. 

She herself has said she feels no emotions. Her twins bio, clearly mentions her as narcissistic. She was a master manipulator, pathological liar (I caught herself many number of times), had extreme abusive personality. Blamed my mother for scolding her but my mother never did. The classic stages of any narc relationship was there in my case too. Initial charm, then slow manipulation, torture for no reason at all and then final discard in which everything is blamed on you. I have undergone therapy after wards with couple of psychologist and psychiatrist. All of them pointed to issues with her mental state. Nothing was wrong with me, expect she had damaged me till the brinks of destruction. She said in the beginning that she has temper issues. People perceive her as having excessive attitude. She was extremely jealous of people. She never said anything good about her friends. She made sure, I don’t meet any one of her friend or colleague. She never shared anything deep about her although she asked everything from me. When I asked she would immediately change topics. There were many mind fukkary with her.  

Anyway I have moved on. The scars will always haunt me but the whole experience has actually changed me for the better. As for me, I know, I am pretty chill guy, quiet fun to be with, actually a real traveller, achieved a lot in my life, and also works as a “Gazetted Officer with GOI”. She works as some associate in some American bank in biryani city.  After her I went on a dating spree, met almost 5-6 girls. Many of them said one thing for sure, I have a very good heart, and I need to preserve it. 

Would like to know, if anyone had experienced narcissism (NPD) first-hand, what their experiences are. For all it is, a proper mental disorder and people having NPD are the epitome of soul destroying b@t@h.

Sports,My ex-company(a giant MNC) wants me to pay notice period recovery amount even when I didn't propose the last working day.,66,c7njxm,do_mech,44,"TLDR/I quit my desk job, since I want to pursue adventure sport of paragliding as a living.I resigned, Manager accepted & he proposed a relieving date - all on email.The company wants me to pay notice period shortfall.

I absolutely do NOT want to pay the notice period shortfall.

**How do I go about this?**

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is indeed long, but please read through for details-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sequence of events in summary:

1. I resigned (official email date 1st January 2019), requested a relieving date from my Manager.
2. My Manager confirmed resignation acceptance & **he proposed the last working day as 28th February 2019**, on email (HR in copy).
3. Per discussion with the Manager, I completed my handover of projects/documentation. I complete last work day formalities & wait for full and final settlement.
4. On March 25th, HR tells me I have to pay a notice period shortfall waiver of 1 month. (citing notice period in contract being 3 months & I have served 2 months )
5. I try to explain, that the date was NOT proposed by me. I followed notice period as advised by the manager & as discussed between me & the manager.
6. They say - Whatever is written in contract takes precedence. Moreover HR cites that the Manager did not explicitly mention in email that the notice period is waived off. I have to pay if I have to clear the dues for the retirals to be processed.
7. Furthermore, HR says this matter is upto discretion of the management ( Management = Centre head of the premises I worked at)
8. My manager is spineless, but I have brought in level-up manager (American) in the communication chain & I would be meeting the centre head in about 9-10 days. (he is out of India right now)

\---

&#x200B;

I have worked for the company for past 6 years. (Out of total 11 years of my total work experience)The company is an Indian division of a giant European MNC.

About a decade ago, the Indian division was mostly a manufacturing facility in Gujarat.

Our centre head is someone who is a veteran from that setup & mostly runs the centre basis same factory-driven-mindset, with loads of hierarchy & ""well set"" grooves and ""network"" of managers.  
That is not how the MNC functions outside India, but the P&L centre shows profit every year, so I guess the counterparts don't interfere.

Since I received the ""Notice period shortfall recovery email"" from HR in March 2019, I have been escalating the issue & seeking a waiver on it, since it was not my suggestion to have a 2 month notice period.

&#x200B;

HR Manager's manager had this overall input ""It is a *small* amount.. You should part ways on good note..""

The HR manager's manager borderline threatened me for the escalation with

""Do you want us to tell **this** when we get a call for background check anytime in the future?""

&#x200B;

He also mentioned, that this is the process they follow & ultimate discretion lies with management now.

So, I figured, it is pointless talking to him.*I did some digging and there was this IT/Systems in charge fellow who resigned recently. He served the notice period & for whatever reason, his manager let him go 2 days earlier, that too with a record on email.Still, he was asked to pay 2 days worth of notice period recovery amount, before his dues were cleared!!He paid it up since he was supposed to leave abroad for his next job & it was a small amount which he didn't want to hold up the larger settlement dues over that.*

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It simply blows my mind, that a company like such is actually hell bent on making money off notice period shortfalls, especially where the parting is mutual & hasn't even caused any business harm/loss or lack of transfer of work.

I absolutely do **NOT** want to pay the notice period shortfall.**How do I go about this?**

I was thinking about:

1. Writing to the ombudsperson (reporting helpline for intercompany disputes) - to get some global heat in this.
2. Writing about this to as many functional head & Global HR email addresses I can gather to just get this escalated so much, that it cannot be just pressed down.
3. Getting lawyer's opinion on this. (I would really like to avoid any legal proceeding, since that would call for a lot of work, time, money!)

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

So , that was last month. Yesterday , I unknowingly used up my 1 GB data pack along with my remaining balance . As usual, I proceeded to recharge through Paytm. Surprise!!! processing failed!! one, two, three, leave it,  six times, the processing failed. Tried with the Vodafone App, nope!! all the tranaction pages starting showing 'Request page cannot be processed ' messages( data packs can be activated  but no talktime ones)Tried calling their customer care, again surprise!! call doesnt go through.

Has anyone got any idea why those hypocrites are doing this to me. Is there any way I can sue them for my hassles?

Non-Political,[Non-Political][Serious]: What's your thoughts on GST now?,35,6izxwj,Responsbile_Indian,10,"1st of all; I'm not looking for political circle-jerking. I'm looking for neutral viewpoint and dispassionate analysis. I personally believe if you passionately hate or support something, you lose the objectivity.

I think it's a step in right direction. However, there is a lot of scope for improvement. I have couple of points to add. Please correct me if I’m wrong and share your valuable insights. Also, comprehensive study articles/papers is most welcome.


* For starters, the rates are quite confusing. and I spoke with a CA guy, he thinks there are a lot confusion as of now. So I think we can say it's in beta phase. After the implementation, govt would need to sort out various issues and make sure it increases the efficiency. Also, I think rates for various items have been decided in haste and randomly. So, that has to be addressed after the implementation.


* I think it doesn’t solve the central issue. Police at the state borders will make other excuses to stop trucks and demand bribes. One of my relatives is truck transporter. If the driver doesn’t pay the bribe, police simply break their headlights and then charge the fine. This is a lot common. In this respect, GST barely helps in faster movements of goods. Since petroleum and Alcohol has been kept out of GST, police can stop trucks to check these items.

* It’s far from one tax one nation. The proposed tax structure includes a Central GST, a State GST and an Interstate GST. “Given the current structure, if a person does business in three States, he has to get six registrations and make a number of regulatory filings.

* The Central GST Bill allows the central government to set up an anti-profiteering authority by law, or designate an existing authority to carry out the functions.  The authority will be responsible for ensuring that the reduction of tax rates on account of implementation of GST results in a commensurate reduction in prices.  India has had bad experience with new monitoring bodies. I am afraid this will simply turn another method of officials to strong-hand the honest business and extort money if there is no proper oversight on anti-profiteering body. CVC in railway was established to catch corrupt officials. It is yet to catch a single official and we know how much corruption is there. This will lead to more govt; more govt means more corruption and inefficiency.

* I think it will take atleast 2-3 years to have clarity on rates and various legal issues. Till then, there would be chaos and inflation will generally increase. After that, if govt make right iterations, we might see the benefit of GST.

* Lastly, In India reforms generally work in different way. Govt takes 3 steps ahead and after much brouhaha it takes the two steps back. So, you are left with only one step in right direction which is better than zero steps ahead.

Non-Political,"[Text] [Non Political] I was on verge of quitting my business after four years, I wrote this to myself.",43,4zkbjx,picturesingh,22,"Waldo Emerson once said that bad times have scientific values, and I can’t recall who quoted that no matter how bad it is, it can always be worse. These are some uninspiring thoughts when we have poured in years of work to learn, unlearn, build, dismantle, and assemble again. 

Some jumping ship, some hanging around fighting for the cause; begging, borrowing, appropriating, somehow, you do everything to never let doubts creep into your mind. 

Some nights are spent, staring at a blank screen, unresponsive code, a sad prototype of the dream that you chase.

Some days are spent, evaluating yourself, if the sum total of your life was a failure that was staring you in the face each day, each night. Your self-worth becomes zero, you become completely undesirable to people who probably loved you once, you have already jerked off to all the porn that you could handle.

By this time, all your friends have become your creditors, with lines of credits exhausted, you scroll your contact list constantly to find that one person, not to seek funds, but to talk with.
We try to hark back for simpler times, reminiscence the moments that made us laugh, then, but we hope probably it would bring an honest smile to our face – our smiles that we had pawned off we did not know when, to users, downloads, sessions and GMVs.

Then one day, you come home, stare at the blank screen, try to make sense of things, break down, and just before letting go of everything seems like an option. You think of Ali, you think of Lincoln, you seek wisdom in the hymns of Nanak, and sagacity and enlightenment from Bhagvad Gita; but you know who comes to your rescue, Earnest Hemingway.

*You are not made for defeat, you can be destroyed, but not defeated.*

To further (mis)quote Hemingway, sometimes our actions are not immediately discernible and when we try for something beyond attainment, something that has never been done, and things that others have tried and failed, and perhaps with ‘karma’ you will succeed.

Non-Political,[Non-political]You can't solve my economic crisis but you can read my story,20,7nx36o,venkatb10,2,"Here is the story,

In India, it takes a lot of guts to take up what you love and pursue it as a career because our parents love us too much to make some risky decisions. 

I am 21 years old now all I did was to follow the path showed by my parents. I never got to know what I love because I didn't there were many options in this world. All I knew was if you want to live a life decently you have to do an engineering job and get a job in a government organisation. 

Engineering opens your doors to the world it shows the all those things you left behind. It starts throwing things at your face saying ""You could have been a lawyer, you could have been an artist, you could have been an artist, blah blah"".With all these revelations about the world, I continued my engineering. I broke my heart, I became a writer, I became a poet, I tried everything in the last 3 years but I couldn't find something which I can hold on to or I can pursue it as a career. Engineering has something for me, it took time but it finally entered into my lazy life.

It took me off my legs, I suddenly felt this is something I can fight for, this is something I can think about all the time, this is the something for which I can wake up at sleep at 5 am daily, this was something I could do all the day and not get bored. 

I started working for The Monologue, NO NO, I don't work for The Monologue, it is something more than it. The Monologue is a platform for storytellers, poets and musicians in Gujarat, India. We are just a group of 7 engineers who have been working in and out al the day just one goal to become the best at what we do. One day I hope that we become the best at what we do.

Most of our parents don't know what we are doing or don't feel that it is a potential career to pursue to live a decent life. I hope one day we prove them wrong too.  

I told you this story because I am the guy who looks after the marketing of The Monologue. I stumbled upon a seminar of Seth Godin(I totally love his ideas on how the world and marketing should be) which can totally turn around the way I see things BUT that costs $745(huge money for an engineering student studying in India). So, I thought maybe someone can help with that kind of, but it doesn't matter now(You read this story that is enough for me). just follow us on Facebook or Instagram search for "" Themonologuein"" that will mean the world to me.

Non-Political,Could someone give me advice on approaching an Indian girl? [Non-Political],16,1xb2ni,alphonse23,46,"I am not Indian. Said Indian girl is a coworker. I work at an American tech company (Indian coworkers not surprising). I'm pretty sure she is Indian Indian (not American Indian) based on her style of dress -- so very likely either she moved here for a job or went to grad school here and accepted a job here and stayed (which seems to be a common scenario amongst many Indian tech workers).

She does this really unusual thing where she goes to the break room, drinks water from a new cup, then throws it into the trash (somewhat dramatically) -- wasting a perfectly clean styrofoam cup that's only had water in it. (Which I consider very wasteful -- it's a styrofoam cup and it's non-biodegradable). It seems a little unusual, but I’m not sure, it could be normal behavior where she comes from.

Though…

My feelings certainly wouldn't be hurt if she wasn't interested. The only reason why I feel the need to approach is because when I first started working at this company there was a lot of eye contact (her fault -- my fault -- IDK). And I have been getting the distinctive feeling that she'd like me to talk to her (though I'm not really sure).

So, what's an acceptable way to start a conversation with an Indian women? From reading about India on reddit and elsewhere, I've heard the culture is very chauvinistic, and that women shouldn't walk alone at night, and that generally woman are off limits in most cases. I’ve heard this from both non-Indians and Indians. And also heard that relationships between men and woman are usually arranged by their parents (and I think Gandhi practiced this, though I don't think it's common practice today) – and so maybe this is why there are no acceptable ways of approaching females.

I’m not trying to be offensive and I don’t’ mean to sound ignorant – but I feel like this is the only way to really gather acceptable cultural practices – through word-of-mouth and anecdotal, folk experiences. 

I'm only asking what's an acceptable way of approaching (as in starting a conversation) with an Indian female -- that could possibly be romantic in nature (I hate saying this..), but without any possibility of coming of as offensive, or as harassment, or in anyway seeming as ""negative"" in intentions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1xb2ni/could_someone_give_me_advice_on_approaching_an/

How can we get this to some news outlet?Non-Political",43,4js5cx,fuckGGSIPU,17,"I'm posting this the third time because /r/india doesn't allow quora links. You can find the source by copy pasting some text from below and googling.

> I am going to write the truth about this unfair evaluation..there are few things u must know...
> 
> 1. GGSIPU pays Rs. 25 per answer book ....in one bundle there are 30 answer books so it makes Rs750/-  for evaluating one bundle....GGSIPU norms say that a evaluator must take 3 hours to evaluate one bundle....so in a day a evaluator can evaluate a maximum of two bundles.....which makes a total earning of Rs.1500/- per day + a conveance of Rs.600/- per day making the total amount = Rs. 2100/-.
> Now what actually happens is in the university there are two evaluation centres one for first and third year and the other for second and final year.....now actually what happens is....an evaluator reaches centre A at 9:30 am and get a bundle issued which he/she checks in one hour but do not deposit it as the university employees will not take it back before three hours...so they leave that bundle there and rush too the B centre and get another bundle issued there at 11:00  they check it by 12:00 now they rush back to centre A to return their previous bundle and get a new bundle issued there....the same process is repeated and an evaluator ends up in checking two bundles each at both evaluation centres thus earning Rs. 4200/- a day instead of Rs. 2100/-  a day..
> now just imagine the answer book u wrote in 3 hours is evaluated in less then 2 minutes.....coz the evaluator has to right the marks on front sheet and do the total and also fill an additional evaluation sheet with marks....and all this he does in a maximum of 1 and a half hour for 30 answer books. This is done by around 20 % evaluators who comes for evaluation.
> 
> 2. To be an evaluator the university ask every evaluator to fill a form which contains a maximum of four subject that the evaluator has taught in the current semester.....this form need to be signed by the hod and the head of the institution also......now the beauty is very few teachers teaches more then two subject in college but in these forms most of the evaluators fill four subjects....now imagine four subject for centre A and four subject for centre B which mean they know 8 subjects and thus makes them elligible to check copies of 8 different subjects...coz if one subject answer books are over then they can get the next subject issued....
> 
> 3. Approx. 80 % of the evaluators do not prepare a solution nor do they know the solution.....they are just giving average marks.....that is the reason why the students writing anything get marks and often pass the exams.
> 
> 4. Most of the senior and sincere teachers do not go for evaluation....the people doing evaluation are primarily those who are on consolidated salary getting anything between Rs.20,000/ to Rs. 30,000/- as salary from there parent college....so they find it as an opportunity to earn some extra money.....just imagine that there are evaluators who earn around Rs. 50,000/ or even more during evaluation......this should explain most of the reasons....
> 
> 5. The fact is very few evaluators actually evaluate the answer books....90% of evaluation is done with just the monitary benefits associated with it....so until the university takes some serious counter measures .....this will continue to happen.....

Need guidance from those who have been in interviews before.",3,610xfr,DaPompousWiz,3,"The title is too TL;DR. I'm a South Indian male in Maharashtra and I have applied to Christ College in Banglore (which happens to be my native place, sort of) for a triple major programme (BA PSEng and PSEco) and my interview is on the 13th of May. Now, this is the only place where I applied, so not getting in will be difficult even though I'm quite confident that I'll get in.

I come from a reputed school and junior college (Smt. Sulochanadevi Singhania School) with what I consider sub-par marks (64% average in 11th, which is the marksheet I had to submit) and I need some help with this interview, especially from someone who has hopefully gone through the same process before.

Now I don't know anything at all about interviews and I have many questions (how ironic) and I'll be very grateful to have them answered. My questions mainly revolve around a general interview and not ""what questions do they ask"" or something like that. The things that I am sure I have covered are my attire and myself. However, there are things that I doubt very largely.

.


What am I supposed to bring to this sort of interview?

.


If I'm supposed to bring a Portfolio, what should that contain? In what format? I'm absolutely clueless.

.


On a scale of 1 to 10, how much can I ""brag""? 1 being ""I am educated"" and 10 being listing all my talents, anything I have ever achieved in life, proficiency in Premiere Pro and Photoshop, etc.

.


How do I convey that I am more than that piece of paper? How much should I keep to myself?

.


I'm not too artsy, so how fancy should my portfolio look? Is a simple, plain, printed text sheet enough? (I'm really good at editing though, so I can handle digital stuff well)

.


How much weightage do my board marks carry? I scored well in 10th and stayed afloat in 11th and 12th. I'm hoping that my 12th boards will be reflective of my intellectual value, so I'd also like to know which standard is looked at more specifically or if it's looked at as a learning curve.

.


I might ask more questions later, so I'd love it if you could answer. Nonetheless, thank you so much for reading this anyway.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/610xfr/nonpolitical_hi_randia_im_a_std_12_student_who/

Non-Political,[Non-Political] Update: Udta Punjab - CBFC issue.,4,4n477u,bojackarcher,6,"The issue has just taken an interesting turn. 

1. Anurag Kashyap (AK) had apparently alleged yesterday that Pahlaj Nihalani (PN) & Co. had not given them their decision including the list of required cuts in writing. PN just said in an interview that AK & Co. were scheduled to collect it yesterday (June 7) morning. However, they did not do so and later in the day went to the media and said that CBFC had not given them the certificate. Now, the same has been collected by them today.

2. AK said that CBFC ordered them to remove 'Punjab' from the film title. PN says they never asked AK & Co. to change the film title and that AK is only doing that for publicity. 

And now for some extremely shoddy reporting from India Today (IT) (which I had some respect for before today):

A. PN specifically said in the interview (which IT showed like a hundred times continuously like every Indian news channel always does) that during his tenure, 72% of the films have been allowed without any cuts. India Today reported that PN claims that CBFC has approved 72% of Udta Punjab.

B. AK had made some wild allegations against PN including stating that he (PN) was a megalomaniac. PN unequivocally stated that he hasn't met AK after Bombay Velvet. IT, grossly twisting this, reports (quoting PN) that PN has NEVER met AK.

Now, yesterday, I was insanely furious against PN & Co. after watching my favourite director's (AK, not PN) passionate appeal in the interview. However, if I had watched only IT reports without having seen the interview, I would be fully pissed and transform into my keyboard-warrior mode against PN & Co. However, the shoddy reporting by IT makes me a bit skeptical about how much of this whole story, as portrayed by AK & Co. and the reporting by IT (usually), is exactly as true as they say it is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4n477u/nonpolitical_update_udta_punjab_cbfc_issue/

Now, the thing is they desperately wanted to make this trip, but couldn't and I fail to understand why she couldn't make the bookings herself and got me thinking - do all couples keep their finances apart? I ask because there are a couple of other red flags in their relationship like he doesn't let her travel anywhere alone or mingle with people freely; especially his friends.

Non-Political,[Non-Political] How does /r/india feel about 2 states?,12,23h3tq,sudbud,27,"IMO: As a person brought up in a family with 2 states culture IRL this is just a cheap mockery of exaggerated stereotypes in a loud nonsensical lengthy Bollywood movie. Could not even get through the book but was hopeful at least  the movie would do justice to the best kind of love stories in India. The real life issues of  reactions of different family members, difference in opinions, some compromises in traditional value, concerns of extended family and how they come about to achieve a middle ground none of which was  depicted in a proper way. It was borderline racist sometimes without being apologetic even when there was absolutely no requirement for scenes like that. And no, that never increased the humor quotient of the movie which was already as low as the film maker's standards.  To summarize, it  was as if a hollywood romcom was made about interracial marriages where the family of the whites gifts fired chicken to the blacks and the blacks would get them all some guns  as gifts because they are from Texas. 

TL;DR: Exaggerated, stereotypical, racist lengthy movie. Is it the beginning of Chennai express style money making Bollywood formula?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/23h3tq/nonpolitical_how_does_rindia_feel_about_2_states/

And there was two bike constantly overtaking me and cutting me on and off I got frustrated and honk and them. 
And now the show start the fucker stops his activa in middle of road and start hitting on my windshield there was a bike also involved with them 
They start calling me names (my car no is from North)  as to talk to them my friend  lowered the window the slapped him and as a consequence he got out and they starting beating him.. 
I panicked and by the time I was out of my car they already pushed him to the footpath my other friend ran toward him... 
I just came out of driver seat and saw it all by the time I just wanted to hit them and start fight but refusing that my reflex was to call police....  Called 100 and spoke to the receiver 
Ass soon as I told them that police is coming they stopped 
But to my irony the gathered crowd starting to be with the culprit... Telling me why you are calling cops and dnt register the case it will damage your career.... Fuck it man 
I dnt why it is always fault of the car driver.. They are just saying forget that.. But I registered the fir 
After that I know by attitude of police they will do least for me..... 
Now after that I  thinking I should have hit them hard but I dnt know if I have dine right thing by just calling police... No was supportive of that.. 
I am literally about to cry should I have kicked them rather calling police.... 
They left as soon as they heard police is coming..  But I cannot face the fact I didn't beat them up.. 
And now the gathered crowd just saying let it go.. 
I know I'll get down voted this was just a rant...

I'm writing an analysis on India's media industry (for an International Marketing class) and wanted to get some pointers on where to start: The purpose of my paper is to basically dissect the industry and then make hypothetical recommendations to a company currently operating in the country. Some of the subtopics I am most curious about are:

1) radio broadcast in India (popularity/demographics of listeners, types of shows, are they generally profitable? Does the Indian listener prefer Desi music or a wider variety?)

2) music industry: It is common knowledge that the most popular music is likely associated to Bollywood, but I wanted to know if there was an independent music culture as well? How do musicians typically make music outside of the film industry?

3) what kinds of TV shows are most popular? What American shows are popular in India? Are soaps/serials popular amongst the youth? How is Aamir Khan's satyamev jayate amongst the youth? Are there other similar shows as such?

4) Networks: what are some of the powerhouse network companies? what networks are popular amongst young adults?

5) News. how do young adults get their information in India? what news channels are popular/reliable?

6) Do young folk read the newspapers?

If there's anything you personally find interesting about the industry, I would love to hear it! Thanks for the help, this is the brainstorming session for what I hope becomes an interesting paper. Thanks in advance!

Update:

I contacted Amazon about the issues I’ve had with Bluedart and how I was going to end up disappointed with my first Amazon.in purchase. I was pleasantly surprised when I got a reply in a few hours (way before their 24 hour wait period for emails). They promised me that the couriering will complete in time and they will prevent any such issues from happening again.

I ended up getting two Bluedart and one Fedex package in the next couple days. This is the *first time* that Bluedart has been able to “find” my address, LOL!

Let me also add, this Amazon email I got as a reply was one of those rare customer service emails that didn't sound self-defensive but really genuine and helpful—when something wrong was pointed out against the company.

Thanks for your thoughts in the previous post, guys.

A very close friend of mine is asking me to invest in his real estate/business venture as a partner. I'm one among 80 or so partners. Most of them are in India and a few in the US. The venture specializes mostly in the San Francisco and East bay real estate markets and only deals in commercial property. Hotels, Office spaces, Apartment complexes and such. The company itself is registered in the State of California.

My question is, do I have any advantages to investing in that market? Taxwise, do I have any benefits when I repatriate the profits back to India? Most importantly will my money grow? The US has low inflation comparatively, so that should help. But am I missing something?

Escuse me for bothering you with a travel related question. Furthermore I understand that some of you are tired of 'westeners in yoga pants'. Please understand that I am not visiting your country out of an idea that you are nothing more than a spritual country.

With this said I am seeking your advice.

I am an european male travelling to India in about a month time. I have heard many good stories from friends who have been in your country. I will be in India for about 6 months (October - April) I think. If money and desire suffices.

I want to experience India as a country; culture, food, people etc. But one of my main plans is to find a good place for yoga. Ideally I would find an ashram where I could stay for 2-3 months. Maybe, if it's possible I would like to do a teacher training course, mainly because I want to deepen my own practice but maybe, some day, I could be interested in teaching.

BUT when I try to find places online it is really hard to determine the quality of the courses and, of course, I do not like being ripped of/wasting my time.

As I understand there are many places in India for yoga. Rishikesh, Varanasi, Mysore are the main ones that I have come upon.

I almost decided on not booking anything in advance and then travelling to a yoga city to find a course.

In this regard, do you have any advice? Cities? Specific ashrams? Ways to approach this?

I have tried in /r/yoga . I have tried different yoga forums. I have tried google. All without much result.

Anyways, I speak English as my only language, although I can speak Hindi, just with a very western accented voice, and I can understand most of it.

I'm a pretty big guy (almost 2 metres) tall so I'm not like tiny or anything either if it is indeed dangerous. Also, what are some suggestions for someone like me to do?

I have **never** had a single good experience with BlueDart.

Any other courier service, usually Flipkart, Snapdeal, Jabong, etc. based, have been able to find my location perfectly, but not BlueDart. They don't even make a phone call—simply say “address not found”.

Seems like I will have to end up getting a refund from Amazon instead of wasting a couple days more for BlueDart to tell me they can't find my address.

Non-Political,"Hinduism, conversion and the neutrality of the Indian Secular State: a non-political, theological exploration",1,2qlsrb,He-Hell,9,"tl;dr:

* Pagan traditions and Semitic religions are fundamentally different manifestations of religiosity. 

*  Traditions are difficult to proselytize because they do not consider other traditions as false. 

* Semitic religions believe that some religions are indeed false and so encourage and facilitate conversion. 

* The Indian state sees Hinduism as just another semitic religion. 

* The Indian state by allowing conversion is working within a Christian theological framework. It is not being neutral.  



Full length:

In India, we have two different kinds of religions: Pagan or Dharmic or Indic traditions (Hindu, Jain and Buddhist traditions) and Semitic or Abrahamic religions (Islam and Christianity). 

Hindu traditions exist because they are passed down from one generation to the other. Such traditions do not actively seek converts because they do not entertain the notion that other people follow false gods or have false religions. 

Such traditions see things like devas or puja pr bhakti as familial or traditional practices. They are followed in order to maintain some continuity between different generations, not because they contain some grand and timeless truth. The practioners of such traditions might try to justify their actions (a Durga bhakt would say that she is worshiped because she killed a powerful demon).  Such justifications are mostly offered to outsiders (non-bhakts or non-hindus) and are not theologically consistent. 

Observing ancestral practices need not be justified logically just as there is nothing logical about writing a sonnet using just 14 lines. Why 14? Its just tradition. There is nothing scientific or logical about it. 

 Semitic religions (namely Islam and Christianity) spread partly as ancestral practices and partly through conversion.

 Islamic and Christian theologians try (not always successfully of course) to be logically consistent because they  think that they are after some grand and timeless truth. Using the God-given faculty of Reason, they want to understand the nature of Creation and the Creator. Conversion makes sense to Muslims and Christians because they think there are false religions and false gods. And the people who worship such false gods will be punished after they die by the True God. To save the “heathen”, Muslims and Christians are encouraged to engage in proselytization and conversion. 

The heathen needs to be saved from his own spiritual blindness.
 

Indian secularism is defined as equal respect and equidistance from all religions. The secular state sees Hinduism as just another Semitic religion with an internally consistent theology containing a singular grand Truth. So a Brahmin is just another kind of Priest, and Gita another kind of “religious” text like the Quran. Having confused tradition with religion, the Indian state allows for proselytization thinking that it is possible to convert people from one tradition to the other. 


By allowing proselytization and conversion, the Indian state has accepted that:

1.	There are some True gods and some False  gods.
2.	It is possible and necessary and understandable that people can be “saved” from eternal damnation for worshiping false gods. 
3.	Hindu traditions can compete financially and theologically in the “marketplace of damned souls” on a level footing with Islam and Christianity.
  
None of the above statements holds up to  **neutral scientific scrutiny** . Do humans have souls? Can souls be damned? Are there True and False gods? Do Islam and Christianity contain some timeless truth? 

Within the framework of Hindu “theology”, the notions that there are false gods and that you can be punished for worshiping such goads do not make sense.

However, all of the above statements make sense within the framework of Christian theology. 

Faced with two completely contradictory theoretical positions (there are some false gods and there are no false gods), the Indian state cannot be neutral. It either allows conversion (as it has done for the past 60yrs) and accepts the semitic notion of false gods, heathens etc or it bans conversion and gives undue advantage to pagan traditions. 

Faced with two very different kinds of religions, the Indian state cannot afford to be equidistant or show equal respect.

Science/Technology,What are the options for part-time undergraduate courses in science/technology for a bright student going through hard times,10,918ek7,kasam_se,3,"I'm not sure how much detail is too much detail, but here's the story:

A few years ago, I was volunteering at a Government school teaching Mathematics and I had a student who is very good at maths and a step above the rest of his peers. He was keen on studying and quick at math. He is hands down one of the best students I had the opportunity to teach. 2 years ago, I was glad to learn that he got into IIIT for it's 6 year integrated program on a scholarship. He comes from a very poor family whose daily wage is few hundred rupees a day on the days they go to work, and he is the only one in his family pursuing studies beyond class X. His hostel campus is about 200 kms away from his home and he finished his +2. 4 more years to go.

However, as fate had it, just last week, his elder brother passed away. Obviously, his entire family is shook and is still recovering. During the rites, not sure if it was his mother or the ""elders"", the paranoia kicked in and it is his mother's and the majority of the ""edlers"" wish now, that he drop his education and support his elderly mother by starting to work as unskilled labor. He is however ""allowed"" to pursue any open degree or a degree at a local college while continuing to work, which I still count as a silver lining. The family is also in debt, so, according to their thinking, they cannot afford their only remaining son pursuing a degree for 4 years at this time.

Absolutely preposterous move, but this isn't unprecendented from families with very low income and very little or no education. Since they are in hard times, I will refrain from the bashing.

As I see it, there are two options. First, is to persuade the mother to let him continue his studies in IIIT so his future is better. A few of their educated kin have advised this to the mother, but I was told the advice fell on deaf ears, understandably so. His classes are starting this week and given his brother passed away only a few days ago, the timing is really bad. Plus, leaving the mother alone at this time also sounds horrible. 

The second option, is to give in to his mother's wishes, stay at home, go to work and pursue study part time. I talked to my student on phone. He is confused and torn, because like I said, he is keen on studying, but also wants to be there for his mother during the hard times. His mother and most of the ""family"" insisting that he go to work isn't really helping. Given that this is almost the end of July, most of the colleges have finished their admissions and he is worried about wasting an year. 

In IIIT, he chose Electronics as his major and he is very keen on pursuing a career in technology. I can vouch for him that he is ambitious and puts in the required work. It would be a shame if his talent/potential goes to waste due to the harrowing situation he found himself in.   I will try my best that he pursues the first option, however, reality is reality and he needs to be prepared for the worst. Given that he will work 48 hours a week and will have the rest of the time to pursue a degree, what are his options in terms of universities/colleges that are still open for admission and will let him pursue a degree part time(the closer to science/tech, the better)? Are there such programs for under-graduation? What are his other options?

Additonal details: His mother stays in Hyderabad, so, universities and colleges nearby are preferred. His mother works as a cobbler and moving to another place is not an option(IIIT Basara is at a remote place and he has to stay in the hostel if he has to pursue the degree). His current college will give a +2 certificate for admissions in a different college. He is turning 18 in a few weeks, but abandoning his mother at this time is not looking likely, unless she comes around after we persuade and is prepared for the hardship. Neither options are easy :(

Please keep the comments constructive. I wrote this in a hurry, so, my apologies if I sound crass.

>""During the dispute over Babri Masjid, Ashis Nandy, a prominent Indian intellectual, began a series of interviews with R.S.S. members. A trained psychologist, he wanted to study the mentality of the rising Hindu nationalists. One of those he met was Narendra Modi, who was then a little-known B.J.P. functionary. Nandy interviewed Modi for several hours, and came away shaken. His subject, Nandy told me, exhibited all the traits of an authoritarian personality: puritanical rigidity, a constricted emotional life, fear of his own passions, and an enormous ego that protected a gnawing insecurity. During the interview, Modi elaborated a fantastical theory of how India was the target of a global conspiracy, in which every Muslim in the country was likely complicit. “Modi was a fascist in every sense,” Nandy said. “I don’t mean this as a term of abuse. It’s a diagnostic category.”

Science/Technology,A criticism of the New Education Policy 2019 and existent education policies,9,bwmz0o,chuttadrockstar,6,"**Problems with respect to HECI and fee fixation :**  One of the biggest problems that the policy has done, is that it has legitimized the policy of state exit and buttressed the belief of Private Education providing Quality education. **HEFA, as has been founded by GoI in association with Canara Bank and has  a corpus of 1 lakh crore of which centre is paying only 8500 crores, puts this whole thing into perspective. The rest of the corpus is to be attained via loans, which has to be repaid by institutes over period of time. Now, indirectly asking, on whom will the institutes push over this liability of 90,000 crores? Its the students, and the pricing of courses**. While Fee fixation and allowing autonomy is welcome to an extent, but let us not fool ourselves, any HEI with half decent infra would need a fuckton of expenditure and the money has to be absorbed from the peoples pockets

&#x200B;

**A blueprint towards privatisation of Higher education.** Not a word has been spoken about Quality Assurance or the fact of Accountability fixation towards Private institutes. ASSOCHAM reports that 93% of the MBAs in our country is unemployable. ( [https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11) ) Now lets get into this quandary. We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.

&#x200B;

**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\*\*.\*\*

&#x200B;

**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses — in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and “delivered” to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :

1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**
2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.
3. **Putting in a process of ""Hands On"" education and not  ""Hands free"" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **""Hands On""** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.

No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.

**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**

&#x200B;

**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**

&#x200B;

**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **""PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS"" , "" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**""  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)

&#x200B;

**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via ""Interested people"". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying ""HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE"" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.

**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be ""leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways"" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of ""PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT"". The push for higher fees with minimal ""restraint"" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both ""Sociologically and systematically"".**

A total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

Science/Technology,What is the Future of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in INDIA?,5,cj7xx0,gajanand_edu,1," 

A news report published in October in The Economic Times said, “Start-ups witness 108% growth in funding in India in 2018.” The news report further mentioned that Artificial Intelligence was among those domains which witnessed the fastest adoption among industry sectors. **Currently, there are about 400 start-ups working on AI and machine learning domains. About $150 million dollars is invested in India’s AI sector by private players alone and the number has been growing since 2016**. Though there has been growth, India lags far behind countries like the US and China in terms of investment. With a copious pool of STEM talent and with a growing population of youngsters, India will be banking on AI for its economic growth and improvement in the quality of life of its citizens.

There are several start-ups that are based in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad which work on artificial intelligence principles to serve consumers better. Their product range varies from multi-lingual chatbots to online shopping assistance and automated consumer data analysis

* **THE ROAD AHEAD**

The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence which was put together by the government of India through NITI Aayog sets the roadmap on how to develop AI in the country. The report points out how AI will help the country grow, what are the strengths and what are the challenges on the way. The government has identified a few areas where it thinks AI will play a crucial role as far as India is concerned

 

Capital and qualified manpower are the two main pillars that are required for the establishment and growth of any sector. India is home to a large talent pool of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math graduates. Companies such as Google, Intel and Microsoft have been offering short term training programs to computer program developers which help them upskill in the area of AI programming. On the other hand AICTE, the government body which governs and regulates professional education in India, recently added AI, IoT, Machine Learning and few other subjects as mandatory subjects in its curriculum of B.Tech programs. Changes in curriculum and content are further expected in the days to come.

Investment towards AI from private players has been increasing in India ($44 million in 2016 to $77 million in 2017). The start-ups have been working towards developing various AI-based products and services. With conglomerates having a lion’s share in India’s market, there is huge scope for AI-based enterprise solutions in the country. The increasing demand for products and services can attract more investment towards R&D in AI sector

Science/Technology,To Redditors of Kolkata,1,bpgagr,arkoprovo1996,0,"It's not the buildings, the roads, the bridges & other concrete that make a city what it is, but the people inhabiting it. Hence, my dearest peers, knowing this city to be their home, lend me your ears.

These are dark times that we're going through. Violence. Oppression. Racism. You name it and it's what we experience, ad nauseam. Change is needed. We need it — we demand it; and this being the season of ballot boxes & EVMs, we yearn to vote to that end. 'Tis here, I beg to differ and ask: is it really a considerable choice when we're given to choose our predators, between lions, tigers and wolves? Yes, one of them is way worse than the others & needs to be gone for everyone's good; but is empowering the other murderers any better?

For as long as I remember, our lives have been spent as slaves & serfs to these powers: the fools, bigots & goons, called politicians we elect into leaders, the banks, capitalists & industrialists we sell ourselves to and to each other, caught in their barbaric game of tag, in which we're all 'it' in the end. I want to change all of that; don't you?

They say, everything big, starts small. Hence, in a world of 7.6 billion, would it be too wrong to start with our city of 14 million, prided so much for its openness, liberalism & intellegentia? Kolkata is OUR CITY: OUR COMMONS, OUR HOME, enclosed by bigots & greedy gluttons to have created a graveyard for our dreams and for life, especially for the thousands who pour into it everyday, hoping to obtain the collectively acknowledged fictional oxygen, called money, required of us all to exist. This is no longer a city, but a corporate heath, bearing concrete in place of vegetation.

I yearn of you, hence, let's not set aside our differences on who we wish to elect, which fiction we wish to pray to and so on, but evolve our minds to move beyond such gibberish and actually work to make this city sustainable, homely, liveable, post partisanism, post market, post capitalist and really smart, not just a dumb city with proprietary wifi, that the oligarchs deem smart. Let us build, on this pyre of yesterdays' failures, a new city that truly would shower joy on all.

Considering today's problems, my wish is to take back the city into our collective hands, as our commons, manage it so, and make it thrive, not grow exponentially. Of course, when I say take back, I don't ask for a violent revolution of the ploretariat, but establishment of mutual-aid-networks & P2P Commoning practices, with each of our houses, condos, etc. being its reliable nodes. It is impossible to build such a space using current structures, such as the market (a network where people paywall goods & services to exploit each other & accumulate capital) or the state, with its systemic biases of race, religion, etc., the NGO circus standing on Corporate Social Responsibility Grants, acting as band-aids distributed by those that machine gun us, and other top-down, vertical (hierarchical) institutions. Therefore let's start here, as the Kolkata Commons Collective, a mutual-aid-network, where we organize ourselves horizontally, as equals, and work hard to produce, maintain and common the commons for us all to enjoy.

In case you think my beliefs to be Utopian and my ideas too lofty, the same was & still is thought of the knowledge commons: Wikipedia, the numerous thriving Wikis, Free & Open Source Software, especially Linux, which powers apart from the desktops of a few of us, the entire internet, all supercomputers, most phones (Android, Sailfish, Tizen), Open Source Hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, RISC V, the Wikispeed car, FOSMC bike, 3D Printers, Open Designs, Creative Commons works, Theatre Commons grouups, Cities like Seoul, Barcelona, Brussels, etc., the hackerspaces & real makerspaces (anarchist, non-profit, commons oriented ones, unlike the corporate, for-profit open washes of science museums & technical schools) coming up around the world, etc., and many more. The big question is, whether we continue our banal, servile, practically cannibalistic ways, being skeptical of our capabilities, or pitch in to prove the market-worshiping, orthodox, skeptics wrong, to liberate ourselves and eveyone else?

[Here's a nice introduction to the Commons](https://youtu.be/nsRFdBBOyzU?t=155).

In case you wonder what are these commons I so talk about, feel free to check this [6-minutes' short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_pRS9167vk) or [24-minutes' long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cKrcQ30518) explanations.

After that of course, let us please network & work! Here are some of my proposals — a list to which you're more than welcome to add, via comments maybe.

Proposals:—

* Localizing our physical, economic circuits to reduce the ecological footprint & make the city resilient to calamities, both natural & artificial. The media may be glorifying Orissa on its disaster management, since Fani hit, but let's remember that huge sectors of the state are still dead, without electricity, water, etc. since being dependent on a centralized power grid system, they've no recourse but wait for the long electrical and other circuits to be connected again become functional again.
* So noting the above, creating, improving & sharing our own version of [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/)'s [Global Village Construction Set](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/gvcs-machine-index/), and establishing a network of [Hackerspaces](https://hackerspaces.org/) to start manufacturing [Glocally](http://commonstransition.org/what-is-p2p-an-introduction/) (doing the light things globally and the heavy things locally), to aid us.
* Running a web of [SOLEs (Self Organized Learning Environments)](https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/) to aid our education.
* Creating a distributed internet based on meshnet technology, using the [ESP8266](http://esp8266.net/) and similar Open Source Wireless microchips, protocols like [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) like systems, etc., to free our dependence on centralized, paid, private connection providers  we use to access the WWW and communicate. So think distributed web with [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/) & [dat](https://datproject.org/) protocols, along with garlic routed, P2P VoIP, accessible & managed as a common, without any central authority or monetary barriers.
* Manufacturing & distribution of basic phones similar to the [WiPhone](http://a.wiphone.io/), to inhabitants who require it, and much, much later, a fully Open Source, [RISC V](https://riscv.org/) based smartphone running [Android ROM](https://source.android.com/)s or [GNU/Linux distros](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-alternatives-android/) with touch friendly UIs.
* Establishing a real, public transport system using car-sharing algorithms (Real Sharing and not Uber/Ola/Lyft/.../'s share washed micro-lending economy) to share the leftover seating & storage spaces on our existing Cars, converting our petrol & diesel drinkers to sustainable, local sources, such as electric, via renewables like solar, wind, hydro, etc., collecting, scavenging & hacking the abandonned vehicles, lying on randomly on roads, especially around Police Stations to aid these ventures, producing, distributing & evolving the [WikiSpeed](http://wikispeed.org/), [OSCAR](http://www.theoscarproject.org/), [OpenMotors](https://www.openmotors.co/)' [Tabby](https://www.openmotors.co/tabbyevo/), [FOSMC](https://www.fictiv.com/blog/fosmc), & other platforms, and connecting them as a Transport Commons for everyone to enjoy.
* Running networks of [submersiles](https://www.openrov.com/), [solar powered](https://solarimpulse.com/), [lightweight](http://ligeti-stratos.com/index.html) [aircraft](http://makerplane.org/) & [low altitude satellite systems](https://libre.space/), to physically reach greater distances without having to go through state regulations and corporate pay walling.
* Establishing distributed power-grids, using solar, wind and other available, sustainable technology, to escape our dependence on the Power Corps.
* Movement to Open Source platforms, as opposed to proprietary, private ones to remove our dependence on Corps. For instance, moving from MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, etc. to GNU/Linux distros, FreeBSD forks, etc.
* Nurturing Open Source Communities, to voluntarily labour to help develop the global Open Source pool and other Commons
* Creating a [network](https://farm.bot/) of Vertical Farms, Aeroponic Gardens, Aquaponic Greenhouses, and so on to [produce](http://farmhack.org/tools) Food Commons for us all, networking into a post-market, moneyless ecosystem using the [Open Food Network](https://openfoodnetwork.org/).
* Creating a network of sustainable [water](http://www.freewat.eu/) cycles to provide potable, [fresh water commons](http://openwaterfoundation.org/).
* Providing universal healthcare as a commons, producing [Open Source medicines](http://www.opensourcepharma.net/) & [medical equipment](https://hackaday.com/2018/01/30/making-the-case-for-open-source-medical-devices/), in our mesh of [bio-hackerspaces](https://biohack.me/), [while also](http://openbci.com/) [extending our human bodies](https://openprosthetics.org/)' capabilities through transhumanist practices and sustaining a thriving grinding (biohacking) culture in the city.
* Hacking our prodigal buildings to make them [more comfortable, effective & efficient](https://www.openbuildinginstitute.org/), connecting everything with DiY Open Source IoT systems.
* Nurturing a thriving pro-science, DiY, hacker/maker culture in our city along with aiding education in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Mathematics) and the humanities in their advanced forms ... the list goes on.
* And finally, scaling to the suburbs and villages of West Bengal, and even other cities in other states, connecting Kolkata to the global commons movement, and making ourselves visible on the global map, to help liberate the world.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bpgagr/to_redditors_of_kolkata/
Science/Technology,Need help with depression and anger.,7,7yz12m,officialshebu,3,"Recently got my heart broken, realised it was unrequited love. Been feeling like shit since then. Now I think I'll have to live with this all my life. My life is nearly fucked up beyond all repairs. I thought this might be the last phase of my depression but it's just another phase, all I want to know is when will this shit end. My demons are killing me from inside. I'm hurt more than I show.

The anxiety and insecurity was killing me from a long way back but now when came to know about it being unrequited just turned them into deep/severe depression. I just can't concentrate on any thing. My memory is all gone I think, I'm numb and soulless from inside. 

I was handling it pretty well then day before yesterday one of my toxic friend started snooping her and then messaged me about it which fucked me up pretty badly. I just don't know why, what am I doing. 

Nowadays for me a ""good day"" is the one in which I'm less hurt and less dying from inside. I don't think there's anything called ""happiness"" it's just a myth in my opinion. 

I even read 'The subtle art of not giving a fuck' it helped me for sometime but now I'm again back to square one. 

Why is that all of a sudden all I'm thinking about are relationships, all my friends discuss onlu about girls and then they start crying about their past failed relationships man don't you guys have anything else to discuss. We're just 18 why can't we discuss something about science, technology,career, business, politics etc why the fuck all of a sudden after entering the college all I hear and discuss about relationships, ""ohh what if I die single"" ""ohh why I'm a nice guy"" ""ohhhh Fuck I never had been in a relationship till now and I don't wanna graduate single"" are the thoughts which wander in my mind. 

Pre-college I was never like this, I was a positive guy, minding my own fucking business, wanted to do something in life, had so many dreams of my career but now 7-8 months later all those realistic goals are blurred all I'm surrounded by is ""relationship goals"" why is my generation so much into this ""my soul mate"" shit can't they focus on their career and become something big so that their parents can be proud of them? No all they want is a ""shoulder to cry on"" ""another person to share all they had in their good for nothing day"" more interested in ""opposite gender"" if you don't have any ""opposite gender bestie"" then you're a piece is shit, if you don't have a ""significant other"" you're good for nothing, if you're a shy guy who just likes to listen more than to speak then you're not worth ""dating"". 

And what's wrong with this Indian system of dating. You first start ""liking"" the other person then you ""propose"" and then you start dating. Dafaq!!?  Why can you first start ""seeing"" each other then start dating and then if things turn out pretty good then you're automatically in a relationship no need to propose for being ""girlfriend/boyfriend"".

I'm just losing it all, I don't want to be in a relationship I don't even wanna hear anything related with it, all I want is to concentrate on my career cause that's what will start with me in the long run. But apparently I can't focus on it. Anybody of you got anything which might help me? 

I've decided to change few things surrounding me and with myself.

1) I'll not speak or discuss anything about relationships or my heart break with friends in college anymore cause all they give is very toxic advice like beating up the other guy and so on.

2) I'll try my best to focus back on my career.

3) I'll try ""pleasure-mastery"" therapy.
....

Will add if you guys advice something worth it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7yz12m/need_help_with_depression_and_anger/
Science/Technology,"[NP]Engineering Education In India: Hot Intake, Cold Results",46,4gbzmf,hganjoo,18,"Under the new NDA government, there has been a rush to establish a glut of premier technical institutions. A proposal for six new IITs has been ratified, in addition to the nine new ones already established in 2008. The total number of candidates in the JEE (Mains) was 12.5 lakhs this year. The All India Council for Technical Education recognizes a whopping 6,378 institutions for undergraduate engineering study, with a humongous intake of 31.78 lakh. The All-India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report for the year 2013-14 pegs the proportion of undergraduate enrolment in engineering, technology and computer fields combined at 20.08%, second only to the combined field of Arts, Humanities and the Social Sciences.

However, does quantity mean quality? Does offering long-reaching career choices to students not old enough to vote or drink, and parents out of sync with the current market and research scenario fare well in the context of Indian higher education?

**Indicators of Concern**

*Employability*

The National Employability Report published by Aspiring Minds in 2015 presents worrying numbers that paint a sorry picture. It found a meagre 17.91% engineers employable in the software services sector, and an abysmal 3.67% in the software products sector. In non-IT roles, the statistics were as alarming, with only 6.5% and 5.55% engineers employable in design roles in electrical and mechanical engineering respectively. 

The report comments that most candidates lack basic programming and algorithmic knowledge, and in non-IT core roles, there is lack of a clear grasp of fundamentals, which is often the only thing required by recruiters. In fact, it says that 60% of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge. 

The go-to option for a burgeoning class of aspirers, engineering represents the “easy path”, and a focus on end results eclipses learning processes. Moreover, choices of specialization are made based on entrance examination ranks, before any taste of specialised curricula or actual field work in a particular subject. Such ill-informed decision-making is bound to generate an outpouring of reluctant engineers who are confused and ill-equipped in their respective areas. 

*Output*

The other important outcome of technical education is research and development. Contributing to advancing technology in terms of academic research and patents is an important development indicator, as R&D output has direct effects on economic prosperity and standard of living. 

The SCImago Journal & Country Rank rates publications and countries in terms of research output in different fields. Ranking countries by citations-per-document published, which indicates the average number of times a paper has been cited by other works, we find India ranked a middling 40th among 87 nations with at least 1000 engineering publications from 1996 to 2014. 

According to data collected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on selected indicators of innovation among labs and higher educational institutions in 2014, we find India comes 31st out of 48 ranked entities in terms of patents filed per GDP as a percentage (including a combined number for the EU, which comes above India). 

We see how India languishes in the middle in terms of both patents and it the citation counts of academic publications. What forces are afoot that drag India’s comparative performance into mediocrity despite the colossal undergraduate intake? Let’s crunch some numbers to get to the bottom of it.

**A Chain of Causes**

*Postgraduate Education*

Research output also measures the health of postgraduate and doctoral education in the countries, signalling the willingness of undergraduates to continue in the field of their choosing. A report published in 2013 by the South Asia Development Sector of the World Bank says that 94.56% of engineering students in India are undergraduates, with only 5.4% in Master’s programs, the lowest but for Brazil. 

At the same time, a 2014 report published by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP) in the United States says that a huge majority (81%) of India-based graduate students are in STEM fields. 

This data points to a prevalent scenario in which limited information and social pressure compels undergraduates to pick engineering, but the higher education machinery fails to retain numbers at postgraduate levels, at least in India.  Students who can afford it fly abroad, especially to the US for search of better options in education and employment. 
The AISHE 2013-14 report also says that only 9% of its respondents who had enrolled in postgraduate courses went on to pursue a PhD in the field, which links us to the next issue. 

*Throttled Funds*

The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation. Junior research fellows take home Rs. 25,000 per month, while senior PhD candidates get Rs. 28,000. Moreover, insufficient funds are allocated to science and engineering research, making the production of high quality matter more challenging. 
International Science and Engineering Indicators published by the National Science Foundation of the USA include the proportion of GDP expended on R&D, based on which India ranks 40th among 60 nations studied, with a lowly 0.81%
. 

*Teacher Numbers*

Above, we saw how small a percentage of students transition to postgraduate and doctoral studies in their fields, and by extension, the number of qualified teachers at college level falls down, denting the prospects of a proper education for subsequent generations of students, creating a vicious loop of negative feedback. 

Two other statistics and their comparisons in the above mentioned World Bank report signal a severe shortage of teaching resources in the engineering education arena.

Using general higher education statistics from MHRD reports in 2011, the report estimates the average faculty per institution at 19, and the student-to-faculty ratio at 24. The latter ratio depicts the even spreading of teaching resources, and a high value means lesser attention to every individual student’s learning objectives. To put the number into perspective, the AICTE recommends a ratio of 12 at undergraduate level, and 15 at graduate level. 

With better-paying avenues in regular jobs, most fresh graduates stay away from the lengthy and arduous path of academia and teaching.

**Conclusions**

The lack of postgraduates, doctoral researchers, and the best teachers prevents the blossoming of a rewarding academic atmosphere and thus makes departments accumulate reluctant and untrained teachers, by making them unattractive to the best talents.  This stunts exposure to good teaching and research for undergraduates, which in turn contributes to disillusionment, insufficient interest and technical knowledge, low employability rates, and a departure from technical fields of work and study post their first degree, feeding the crippling dearth of skills and results at higher levels.

I understand when a new govt comes to power it appoints its own people to the govt offices. When UPA came to power in 2004, it replaced most of the state governers with its own sympathizers. Now that BJP has come to power, it did the same thing except Mr. Najib Jung. **Fair enough and pretty much consistent**

But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance? How does it serve any purpose? Isn't it against the very philosophy of Make In India? If you want India to develop, you need to have qualified guardians at the institutions of national importance.

I understand that India academia is highly influences by leftist ideology which I personally despise. I'm libertarian & pro-capitalism when it comes to economic ideology. 

BJP is Far Right Wing which has pro-capitalism as economic philosophy at its core. But how do recent appointments justify it? If right wing is about market capitalism, should not BJP give more autonomy to these institutions, instead of screwing up their reputation with high-handed appointments.

I understand top brass of BJP/RSS feel that curricula of Indian education system is against Indian culture/traditions. They also feel that history subject is biased. But if they want to change it, shouldn't they do it at the school level. 

Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?

India already doesn't have any Univ in the top 300 ranking of QS world ranking. With recent high-handed appointments, I'm sure their quality will take a nosedive.

This is pretty much my thoughts. Let us please discuss it. I would request people not to take sides. Please be objective in your analysis based on logic. It's not about BJP/Congress/AAP. It's about me and your future.

Science/Technology,An Exposition and Solution to the NGO problem,1,28fy7b,nerds_revenge,1,"**Disclaimer**: I am not the author. This excellent essay was written by Rudradev@BRF.  

NGOs are non-profit organizations whose ostensible role is to fill in the gaps of social service: education, community services (such as sanitation and health), conservation of natural resources etc. that a government is either too resource-poor and overburdened to fill (as in India) or is not mandated to fill for reasons of small-government conservative political philosophy (as in many developed Western countries).

There have been many such organizations that would fit today's definition of the NGO, that have in fact done a lot of good in India. Amul was a farmer's cooperative in Gujarat that transformed the dairy industry. Baba Amte's organization helped leprosy patients who suffered unjust marginalization and ostracism in rural Maharashtra. The Chipko movement was spearheaded by tribals to preserve their own forest resources. The IDRF and the RSS have been at the forefront of many disaster relief missions. As long as these movements are indigenous, draw their support from local volunteers, and function in coherence with deep-state interests, they have been able to contribute important and desirable services of all kinds.

The problem, of course, arises when foreign resources are used to support NGOs working in India. I have a couple of stories that illustrate why this is by no means a new problem in India, and to suggest a potential solution to the problem of ""filling the gaps in services"" that have given foreign-funded NGOs a way into our system.

The first case involves a close relative of mine. As a newly-minted engineer in the early 1950s, he came to Bombay to join a Government of India concern. The concern at the time was inducting a new technology with American help, as part of a USAID program. An American had been sent to train the Indian engineers in the use of this new technology as part of the foreign assistance package. This was a very common arrangement in the first decade after independence, when the GOI's mission statement emphasized advancements in science, technology and industry.

This American had spent some of his early years in Dehra Dun, and did a passable job of speaking Hindi. He was a genuine expert in his field, was employed full-time at a major US corporation, and trained the young Indian engineers very well. He would also sit in his office after hours, late into the night, typing messages into a telex machine. The Indian engineers, including my relative, would sometimes wonder what was up... ""jasoosi kar raha hai kya?"" On one occasion one of the Indians brought up the matter with the IAS officer in charge of the concern. His reply: ""Is he teaching you well? Then learn from him. Why are you worried what he is doing or not doing otherwise.""

And indeed, they were learning a lot from this American; as young men with Indian traditional values, they respected him as a guru, and in fact many of them went on to have successful and illustrious careers with the benefit of his knowledge. So they let it go.

It wasn't until 20 years later that my relative discovered, by chance, a newspaper clipping of his old American trainer receiving a medal from US President Gerald Ford. It turned out the American was an OSS man who had served with distinction in Burma during the Second World War, and had been on deputation with the CIA in many countries since then, including India.

The point of this story is that this sort of thing has been going on for a long time, ever since India became independent. Foreign assistance came to India at the GOI's request to help fill the gaps in governance (such as advanced training) that the GOI itself was not equipped to plug. Often the assistance package came with strings attached; they were manned by foreign intelligence agents, for example. More surprisingly the GOI KNEW about this, and accepted it... they probably monitored the foreign agents' activities, and tried to ensure that they didn't get their eyes on anything too sensitive, but in the interest of the ""greater good"", GOI policy determined that it was better to have a CIA guy training Indians in a new technology than to not have the training at all. That's just how the priorities shook out.

One can almost understand the appetite for these sort of ""arrangements"" in a new and desperately poor nation willing to pay a high price to improve its future prospects. However, as we know, India's prospects did not improve substantially over the following decades. Corrupt, self-serving regimes led by successive Dynasty potentates showed little interest in building self-sufficiency, in plugging the gaps in governance or indeed, in providing any governance at all. Thus, what was deemed a necessary evil in the 1950s did not fade into obsolescence by the 1960s or 1980s or 2000s... instead, it transformed into an extremely powerful and well-established institution in its own right. The industry of foreign funded NGOs came to dominate every aspect of social, judicial, economic and environmental activism across the length and breadth of India. Over the decades, it usurped mandates extending far beyond its originally stated purpose of supplementing government services. All the while, of course, it never held any commitment to upholding the interests of the Indian deep state.

The NGO monster reached the pinnacle of its strength under Sonia Gandhi's regime over the last decade, finding its ultimate embodiment in the National Advisory Council: a parallel national-level policy-making apparatus, indebted to all manner of foreign interests, that did not supplement the elected Government of India but utterly sidelined it. In the meantime, every constitutionally-mandated institution of the Indian deep state: financial, internal security, armed forces, judicial, was systematically undermined and eroded. This, in fact, is what the IB is warning us of the urgent need to roll back.

So now to my second story that suggests a possible solution to this problem. There are persistent lacunae in social and environmental services that the GOI does not yet fill in India; this we all know. It's also true that the GOI has a vast roster of priority issues to fix at a macro-level, so that however indefatigable Mr. Modi might be, he might very well never get around to taking on these lacunae himself. How do we ensure that they are filled by agents with a sterling sense of commitment to the Indian deep state?

The second story involves a gentleman named Mike who was my neighbour in NYC. I met him when he was 84, and he died five years later.

Mike was a first-generation Italian American immigrant who grew up supporting eight siblings in a small town in upstate New York during the Great Depression. This was a double-whammy: Italians were racially discriminated against by the WASP majority, and the economic circumstances of the time engendered a sort of starvation-level poverty, a near absence of hope in terms of access to education or employment, that the US has not known since the second world war ended.

The solution came from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a US President whom Mike revered as almost greater than human. Apart from a sweeping series of macro-level fiscal reforms, Roosevelt introduced a volunteer initiative called the Civilian Conservation Corps. As part of the New Deal, the CCC provided unskilled manual labour jobs related to the conservation of natural resources in government-owned lands, creating employment for the deprived while also implementing a general natural resource conservation program in every state and territory.

Over 3 million young Americans participated in the CCC, which provided food, shelter and clothing as well as a small stipend; however, it did something far more important. It provided a population on the brink of despair with a sense of commitment, a motivation to serve the community and the nation, and a will to public responsibility. It restored the dignity of a generation who would otherwise have been reduced to begging on the streets. In the case of Mike, and many lakhs of Italian-Americans, this brought about an invaluable infusion of a nationalist spirit that brought them from the margins of society into the mainstream. Learning skills as he went along, conducting minor maintenance on public utilities, helping keep the streets and parks clean and sanitary, Mike eventually joined the US Navy and fought in the Pacific as a Diesel Mechanic on an LST. The GI bill, also a Roosevelt initiative, gave Mike the opportunity to get an automobile engineering degree afterwards, transforming his life (and that of his family) beyond recognition.

What could have been a wasted life of social marginalization and economic victimhood was transformed into an asset to the nation in every way. As one consequence, more Italian immigrants signed up to fight for the US in the Second World War than the total strength of Mussolini's forces!

A very similar initiative to the CCC was taken up by the NSDAP in Germany around the same time: the creation of the Arbeitsdienst. It is derided as ""fascist"" in the dominant Western narrative of today, but it contributed a great deal to the spirit of millions of young men who grew up in the crushing deprivation of Weimar Germany but found themselves willing to sacrifice everything for the Reich.

Can we begin to imagine a time when the ""marginalized"" sections of our own society aren't deliberately kept ""marginalized"" for the benefit of NGOs who profit from their ongoing despair? Where the service left undone by the GOI isn't left to foreign agents with no regard for our national interest, but indeed transforms a generation of Indians... through the very act of rendering that work... into the foremost proponents of national interest in the future?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/28fy7b/an_exposition_and_solution_to_the_ngo_problem/

Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

Then, coming from a lower-class family, there were not enough choices for me to go through - either Medical or ENgineering. I prepared for Medical taking a 1-year gap. Nothing substantial came out of it. In the end, I had to go to engineering. Because sadly, in our country, gap years are a strict no-no for any of the stakeholders and I could not waste 1 more year.

&#x200B;

Did [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) in engineering in Applied Electronics & Instrumentation from one of the 'good' private colleges in Bhubneswar, Odisha. Yes, here in Odisha - so you might have guessed my economic conditions. Passed with Average CGPA of 7.1.

&#x200B;

No jobs came in the engineering field. At last, I was recruited by the service company (name starts with I) and had to go \\ for it.  This was 6 years back.

Why?

Because there was no alternate way for me. I am now the sole bread-earner of the family. My dad has retired from his job.

Trained in Mysore - I was not from a programming background. I found it really hard to go through the training especially the advanced chapters. I had to take a retest for the final exam since I failed in the first one. In the retest, I literally had to take the help of some kind souls who took pity on me and shared their answers. I passed with a retest with minimum pass marks.

GOt posted to Mangalore. Here, literally at the opposite side of India from where I cam from - I felt alone. Loneliness became my best friend. I avoided getting into any projects there -  be it support or development. Because I knew in my heart that I could not do it.

After a gap of almost 1 year there, I was forced by some managers into a support project. In this team, seeing my utterly bad skills, they put into a 1st level support person - a triage one - someone who acts as the first point of contact for customers, records their issues, creates incidents, tickets and passes onto other teammates. Literally this for 1 year.

Then, slowly they put me into an application support where SQL work along with a niche technology called TM1.

Being absolutely weak in any other technologies, let alone niche technologies - i could not really improve upon my situation.   Thus, they kept me in a bare minimum work state in this one too. because frankly I could not doa anything else.

I remained in this project for 4.5 years, then took a transfer to Bhubaneswar. Here, I avoided again, getting into projects for 1 year or more and then was again forcibly put into a support project where Informatica, Unix, TM1, Cognos is being used. I am in this one, at present.

HEre as well, seeing my lack of skills, I was put into a bare minimum level. My lead has literally scolded me so many times that I have become numb.

Below are not excuses or points to validate my inactions - they are just plain naked truths.

NOw after all this, you and hell, I would have asked myself -

what I am doing about it?

What I am doing to learn new skills?

What am I doing to even get into another job?

The answer is nothing. NOthing.  Why?

because I am listless.

I lack the memory right now to retain anything at all. I keep forgetting common things or points let aline study and become proficient in a programming language.

I lack the logical reasoning a person has to learn to actually code.

I lack the mathematical skills.

Now would you believe me if I told you I had scored 100/100 in my Xth Computer Science exam - consisting of OOPS, and Blue Java.

But now, I know what utter waste was that - not worth 2 paise in India and in this hyper-competitive world.

&#x200B;

Since these 6 years now, I have remained severely depressed with OCD patterns coming in as well. My memory has faded. My enthusiasm is gone for anything. Nihilism in my mind. I have tried to come out of it - I am not saying this lightly. I have tried to take away my mind on dwelling on these things and escape through any of the multiple options for a person to get some enjoyment - songs, podcasts, movies, etc.. But nothing works. I, after doing any of this, feel an existential dread as to what I have done in my life to deserve this moment of just happiness says while going to a movie or hearing to some podcasts. Guilt-tripping at its finest.

Sometimes in the middle of a day, I see something or think of something and I break down. Tears and only tears even on a bright day. At night, tears are my only friend.

You might think, where are my friends or family who can help me. The answer is I really do not have any such friends whom you can call at 2 am and speak your sorrow and get a shoulder to cry on.

My family, well - they had high hopes for me. My dad and mum had put everything to get me a good education and now I am in such a state. They are slowly coming to the conclusion that I am an utter failure.

My lifeline has been shredded by my inactions, my lack of skills, lack of intent to improve my situation. And now, too much time has passed. And I honestly don't see any point in it.

Sometimes I wish in my loved one's mind, I cease to exist - their memory of mine being faded in an instant - so that they do not have to go through the pain which they would feel when I take away my life.

What a sorry, pathetic, selfish piece of shit stain am I? You are thinking this, aren't you? Yes, I am that. I am all of them and much more.

But there is literally no way to go on any further for me. I do not see any career paths for me, I am not good at anything, I lack memory, I lack any interest in any field to be proficient in.

All doors are shut for me now.

Today while walking down the road, I suddenly wished what would happen if I just walk right into a front of any ofo the trucks which are passing by.

At least people would be spared seeing such an utter wastrel of a being which I have become to fall down further.

Thus, I have prepared everything to end it swiftly - I have put nominations with my mother's name on it for the 1 account I had. I have everything which they would need in one email - which is just waiting in my drafts to be sent.

I have written my goodbyes to them and prayed to them - they please forget they ever had a son. To erase my memories. I am written my farewell to my loved ones.

Now, thank you, dear readers, for going through this post. You have empathy and I pray for it to grow in your heart.

Bye.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f161mw/serious_post_bye/
Science/Technology,People who test negative might also have coronavirus: Study,43,fywlyr,drgnfly61,3,">scientists have warned about a growing concern: the tests are not 100 percent reliable, meaning people with negative results might actually have coronavirus.
-------------

>The majority of tests around the world use a technology called PCR, which detects pieces of the coronavirus in mucus samples.
-------------------
>there are a lot of things that impact whether or not the test actually picks up the virus,"" Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious diseases specialist at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, told AFP.

It depends on how much virus the person is shedding (through sneezing, coughing, and other bodily functions), how the test was collected and whether it was done appropriately by someone used to collecting these swabs, and then how long it sat in transport,"" she said.

>With 40 million people, ""even if only one percent of the population was tested, 20,000 false-negative results would be expected."" (USA)

Part of the problem lies in locating the virus as its area of highest concentration shifts within the body.

I just put my fingerprint in, held my phone next to the machine and it read the card. All I had to do was insert the pin and I was done. Waiter didn't react much, probably because he was tired. 

2: I used it at a gelato shop. Same POS machine. The cashier said that they don't support mobile payments (lol). I asked them to hand the machine to me, held my phone next to it and boop. It worked. He was super impressed and had this big grin after the transaction.

Science/Technology,Latest Indian Innovations and Funding Opportunities to Combat COVID-19,9,fygqpd,Intepat_ip,0,"The untapped potential of Indian youngsters is coming to light through various funding opportunities and contests organized by the Government of India. Let us look into some more innovative measures around our country to tackle this COVID-19 scenario.

###### Affordable Diagnostic Kits

[Bione](https://www.bione.in/), a Biotech startup in Bangalore, has designed a kit for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 from the comfort of our home. The kit approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research ([ICMR](https://www.icmr.nic.in/)), promises to give the diagnosis result within 5 – 10 minutes.

Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology ([IIT](http://www.iitd.ac.in/)) Delhi have also come up with a rapid diagnostic kit to detect the virus. The kit developed at Kusuma School of Biological Sciences is currently undergoing clinical trials at the National Institute of Virology ([NIV](http://www.niv.co.in/)) in Pune. Innovations in test kits will bring down the cost of testing and also give results within a short time-frame.

###### Bag-valve masks as Ventilators

Bag-valve masks are hand-held inflatable devices to support breathing in critical conditions. Professors from IIT Hyderabad have come up with a similar design that works with power from an electrical source, such as a car battery. The device is cheap, easy to manufacture and portable.

Professor Murty and Professor V. Eswaran from the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at IIT-Hyderabad, say,” the device could be manufactured for less than Rs 5,000, or one-hundredth the cost of a conventional machine.”

###### Portable Multi-feed Oxygen Manifold (MOM)

Vishakhapatnam’s Naval Dockyard personnel have found an innovative solution to meet the demand of ventilators to [treat COVID-19](https://www.intepat.com/blog/patent/the-global-patent-race-for-covid-19-vaccine/) infected patients. The MOM contains a six-way radial header fitted to one cylinder. This portable innovation can supply oxygen to six patients with one oxygen cylinder. MOM is an effective way to treat patients with limited resources available.

###### Herbal Sanitizers

Washing hands frequently can prevent the spread of COVID-19. All countries are stressing the importance of washing hands to keep ourselves safe from infection. The cost and demand for personal hygiene products have shot up around the country.

Students from IIT-Roorkee have prepared herbal sanitizers to promote personal hygiene. The sanitizers meet the regulations of [WHO](https://www.who.int/) and the US government health research institute (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/)).

###### Disinfectant Tunnel

A water treatment company in Tirupur, Tamilnadu has designed a disinfectant tunnel that can disinfect people as we walk through it. This portable tunnel is about 16-feet, made of stainless steel and fitted into a mild steel frame.

###### Arogya Setu and Corona Kavach App

The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology have collaborated to develop a COVID-19 exposure risk tracking applications. The beta version of these Apps will be of use to track if the user has any exposure to coronavirus patients. These Apps will track the user’s location and alert them if they come across a person who was tested positive for the virus.

##### Innovation Contests and Funding Events

Several government agencies and private sector companies have come forward to encourage and support innovations and designs developed to tackle the COVID-19 crisis.

###### COVID-19 Solution Challenge

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has launched this challenge to involve active community participation around the country. The challenge is accepting solutions to help fight COVID-19. The best solutions that could be adopted in real life will be rewarded. The contest will give away prizes totaling to 1,75,000 INR.

The last date to [participate](https://innovate.mygov.in/covid19/) is 16 April 2020.

###### United Against COVID-19-Innovation Challenge

The department for the promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) with Startup India has announced an open call for all companies, startups, and innovators to offer solutions that can bridge the gap between the demand and supply of medical requirements used in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19. The contest encourages innovators to work on med-tech, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things, to come up with ideas, prototypes, and designs to combat COVID-19.

The deadline for [entries](https://www.startupindia.gov.in/content/sih/en/ams-application/challenge.html?applicationId=5e79126ee4b055bfaea9ef66) is 15 April 2020.

###### Challenge COVID-19 Competition (C3)

National Innovation Foundation – India (NIF), an autonomous body under the Department of Science and Technology – India has [announced](http://nif.org.in/challenge-covid-19-competition) a competition to find solutions to the most pressing problems in the COVID-19 scenario.

The C3 encourages innovations to reduce virus transmission, improve sanitizing facilities and enhance door delivery options for the elderly. Currently, the contest is accepting entries on a rolling application basis.

###### Centre for Augmenting War with COVID-19 Health Crisis (CAWACH)

The Indian Ministry of Science and Technology has formed the [CAWACH](https://isba.in/cawach/) to identify and support innovations of startups working on the novel, safe and affordable respiratory devices, personal protective equipment, diagnostics, and any other innovation to control and treat the spread of COVID-19. The Centre is equipped with funds amounting to 56 Crore and plans to identify 50 such innovations and take them to the next level.

Many State Governments have also come up with challenges motivating students, startups, innovators around the country to come up with innovative solutions to face this health crisis. The optimistic and encouraging environment is an ideal platform for budding innovators.

Today marks our 71st Republic day. It's been an [annual tradition of sorts](https://internetfreedom.in/a-republic-day-letter-from-iff/) at IFF to use this occasion to reflect and also indicate what small role we hope to play in support of our constitutional ideals.

## India stands on the edge of a technological precipice

Over a year, IFF's work has strengthened on the basis of the generosity and support of many volunteers, collectives and organizations. In many ways  our advocacy has merely been a top-dressing to a richer foundation prepared with the time and labor of others. Today our mission is stronger both in our ability to do our work and cause impact due to these networks of sharing.

To  cause change over the last year IFF has done substantial institutional  engagement on issues ranging from net neutrality, free expression,  privacy and innovation. These are publicly documented on the website and  I invite you to go through them. As we grow capacity, our work will  become more technology, campaign and public centered. This is not to  say, there have not been attempts over the past year. IFF has become  better at collaborations with other individuals and organizations  primarily in the fields of community building and public talks. We would  like to believe we are contributing to greater partnership in the  domains of design, law and computer sciences which are talking to each  other more regularly than ever before.

We  have tried to swiftly respond when citizen needs have arisen on issues  such as intermediary liability, malware hacks, surveillance drones,  facial recognition and internet shutdowns. This has been followed up  with persistent representations, RTIs and even court challenges. Our  greater realization is that much of this work interacts with Government  institutions. It often requires a fresh set of regulations and by its  very nature the results are tangibly felt in the medium to long term. To  accelerate timelines, one of IFF's missions has to be to complement the  power of movements with building resilient organizational capacity.

Financial  sustainability is vital to make such policy victories a practised reality. We have approached fundraising and our expenses with, civic  legitimacy, discipline and transparency (*transparency is major component of our website re-design that will roll out in May, 2020*).  We have focused on implementing a model of individual giving and  recurring donations that provides five membership tiers and receives  funds only from Indians. These have helped us achieve a marginal level  of predictability in fund flows and a continuous channel of feedback and  co-ownership. All of this is a process of iteration and learning.

We  need to do more to come close to our projected revenue targets that are  accommodated by the generous buffer provided by organizational donors.  Many of them have donated to IFF after learning about our work through  our members who have championed our cause to their management. We are  thankful to each one of them, for helping us do our work independently  and even providing us an opportunity to have conversations with them to  explore how digital rights can help improve user trust in their  products.

Today, donations help fund 3 staffers, an off-counsel. Soon 2 more people will be hired to ""*secure*""   the values of the Indian constitution as put forth in the Preamble.  All IFF volunteers, staff and leadership are guided by a sense of  urgency, recognizing that each day is a call to action to defend your  liberty, equality, fraternity and justice in our digital republic. Dr.  B. R. Ambedkar, put it best, just before the Preamble was put to vote  and adopted, “*I say that this  Preamble embodies what is the desire of every member of the House that  this Constitution should have its root, its authority, its sovereignty,* ***from the people***. ***That it has***.”

We are committed to serving everyday Indians like you.

If you would like to support our mission in 2020, I invite you to[ become a IFF Member](https://internetfreedom.in/donate/) today.

Science/Technology,Chandrayaan Moon Landing,503,d0ffgv,freddledgruntbugly,1403,"ISRO's Chandrayaan 2 mission is a significant technological event that has kept space watchers in India and across the world riveted. The mission to land an Indian lander and rover on the moon's surface was launched on 22nd July, 2019. 

Chandrayaan carries two modules designed to work independently, Vikram, the lander, and Pragyan, the lunar rover. 

The landing module, comprising the lander and rover, has separated from the orbiter and will begin its descent on to lunar terrain shortly post midnight.

**Edit I: (7th September)**


Communications with the landing module were lost while it was around 2.1km from the surface. 

Failures in space exploration are disappointing and expensive - but are inevitable (and one could argue essential for eventual success.) 

To space enthusiasts; keep the chins up - the orbiter lives - and will hopefully fulfill its mission objectives in full. 

**Edit II: (8th September)**

The Chandrayaan orbiter has found the exact location of the lander on the lunar surface. 

ISRO confirms that a thermal image of the lander has been taken. The Chandrayaan 2 team will investigate the reasons for the loss of communication with the lander using signal data.

There is no information on the state or condition of the lander yet.

Science/Technology,A place to discuss scientific and engineering research for and by Indians? [Science & Technology],7,5jscfe,Glorious_Comrade,3,"I've been thinking about this for a while. It would be illuminating to have regular discussions on advanced scientific and engineering research, in the context of India, and amongst the reddit-faring desi junta and interested non-Indians.
 
The topics of discussions could be anything from in-depth technical discussions and debates on a particular research topic, a paper, a government or corporate project to scientific policy, funding & related issues, tips for new researchers etc, if it is spearheaded by Indians (at home or abroad) or is being conducted in India as a part of a global collaboration (e.g., INO).

I am in two minds about what would be a good place for this. One on hand, having a separate subreddit sounds like a good idea to consolidate and stay focused. However, in my experience most Indian subreddits other than randia don't really get much traction and end up dying. I think the goal of such discussions should not only be exchange of ideas and information amongst researchers, but also with a larger audience. Given that /r/India is the largest, most cohesive (heh) agglomeration of desis on reddit, perhaps a discussion thread once/twice a month would be better. Of course, the format and the discussion topics would be more restrained in those threads and won't really be a free-for-all.

Science/Technology,India needs to invest more in education and health care or else the future of India is doomed.,189,e6ekhy,thruaway593,53,"Why doesn't the govt invest more in education? 

Education funding is only 3% of GDP, while many developed nations spend about 6% of GDP. Many experts say education funding should be ideally 6% of GDP.

Look at the age demographics of this country. According to 2011 census data about 608 million (60.8 crore) are below the age of 25, about half the population of the country and about 372 million(37.2 crore) are below the age of 15, so about 30% of the population is below the age of 15, as India's was 1.21 billion (121 crore). Today, we would have even a larger total no. of people below the age of 25 and 15.

It is also said the India's demographic dividend will peak at 2041, where no. of people in the working age (20-59 years old) will peak. 

However if the govt doesn't invest in education and reforms the education system, since our education system is just rote learning and doesn't teach us to think critically, and it doesn't impart people with skills. The literacy rate of india according to 2011 census is only 74% and that vast majority even those who are literate do not receive quality education, it is said that 80% of engineering and MBA grads are unemployable , How will india progress?

Investing in education(and healthcare) is one of the best ways to raise the human capital(skills and expertise of the population).

Currently, india ranks 115 in human capital index. Having high human capital is crucial to economic development, increasing productivity, making progress in science and technology and innovation.

According to a report from world bank,[source](http://web.worldbank.org/archive/website00811/WEB/OTHER/9C8ACC61.HTM?OpenDocument). More than half the children in india are malnourished, 30% of newborns are underweight and 60% of women are anemic. Malnutrition costs india atleast about $10 billion or about Rs. 700 billion(Rs 70,000 crore) in terms of lost productivity , illness and deaths, which is about 23 times the cost of statue of unity.

If india doesn't invest more in education and health care, reforming education and health care system, improving the quality and infrastructure of govt schools and hospitals too, then we will hundreds of millions of unskilled and unproductive people in the future, which would be a disaster to development and progress.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e6ekhy/india_needs_to_invest_more_in_education_and/

Science/Technology,Is the Dream of Kalam dead?,76,ei5wg9,SOCH-staymoderate,17,"2020 is finally on the doorstep. For most Indians who grew up in the last two decades, this was a year we were awaiting for, with hopes. Well, it was even more popular than scary-end-of-the-world predictions of 2012 among others! Well, for once hope won over fear!

Now that 2020 is on us, are we the India 2020 that was popularised by Dr. Abdul Kalam? 

That dream is officially 24 years old. Kalam and his team at TIFAC prepared a vision document for the country in 1996, a decade after TIFAC itself was born, incubated under the Dept. of Science & Technology. Kalam took as much pride in the document as in his successes with ISRO and DRDO.
TIFAC laid down a roadmap for sixteen sectors the country should focus on, with numerous sub-areas of technology assessed as the means to acheive it. TIFAC certainly inspired many govt. funded programmes and missions, including TIFAC-CORE which gave a major push for research infrastructure and Industry-academia interaction.

But will 2020 be the year that Kalam and others dreamt of? Most probably not, we are most likely just halfway in that journey. But on the optimistic side, haven't we grown in all terms in the last 24 years?

But it doesn't stop here, and we needn't dwell in regret. In 2015, TIFAC came up with a renewed mission Technology Vision 2035, a sort of version 2.0, in tune with the changes within India and around the world- a fresh technological roadmap for the country's progress. It's a document prepared with so much love, and all lovers of sci-tech should look into it. As the document says: 
""... while TV 2020 spoke to an aspiration of a developed India in 2020, TV 2035 speaks to the realisation of a developed India in 2035""

https://tifac.org.in/index.php/activities/technology-vision-2035

So lovers of science and the country, let's keep dreaming- this time more vividly and work more vigorously to give our tiny bit to it! :)

Happy new year ! let the dreams keep going!",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ei5wg9/is_the_dream_of_kalam_dead/

Science/Technology,"25M, Need some Career Advice.",11,f4af6s,shadow-sphynx,3," I am a 25 year old guy, currently working at a Web based software company for about 2 years now. The work here is repetitive, with an outdated technology stack and that's why I have been planning to leave it. But I am confused whether to switch the job or do post graduation?

Some background - I graduated from a private college with a BTech degree with average marks. I had some interest in coding since school days that's why I opted for Computer Science. But in the past few months I have come to realize the work I am doing right now is menial and I don't have the skills required to get a job in a good tech company. I have been trying to study to improve them. But without any set target or deadline, I have just wasted the time procrastinating. Also a couple of failed job interviews has made me to think to stop planning about switching and do something else. Like post graduation. GATE and CAT are the only options I have been thinking about because I don't want to study abroad. I have been more inclined towards CAT because syllabus of GATE is vast and since I feel I am good in Logical and Verbal problem solving, given a 8-9 month preparation period I might crack the CAT exam with good percentile. But then I am not sure whether I should leave the tech side for good and switch to management instead.

Please give me some advise about what I should do now. Also please share if anything else comes to your mind that can work for me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f4af6s/25m_need_some_career_advice/

Science/Technology,Anyone from Infosys or any MNC's? I have question about document verification.,4,ex4nis,kallu2u,6,"Hey there , greetings of the day. I recently got placed in two MNC's first is 'hexaware technologies' and second is 'infosys'.
I have gap in my education does it matter when they perform background verification and terminate me afterwards?
 
My story is :- passed ssc in 2012 and 11th in 2013 , HSC in 2014 
But i got only 60% marks so i wasn't getting any engineering colleges so i decided to go for direct second year diploma for year 2015 and i failed in it. So i had to make exit from diploma and tried for HSC improvement for year 2016 . Got 62 and choose ""Computer science"" Btech . I'm expecting to get graduated by 2020. Now i have 2 jobs in my hand . Both are MNCs. There was no gap criteria mentioned for hexaware but i am not sure about infosys. But if it had been i wouldn't have had been selected. ( I mentioned 1 year of gap while giving first round of infosys, i got that round cleared too ) 

 Backround check usually happens with third party companies.   And as my portfolio looks life this
2012 SSC
2016 HSC 
2020 Btech 
We can see there is timeframe of 4 years between my 10th and 12th, but that is not even gap as first i gave HSC in 2014 , for 2015 i was pursuing diploma ( which i left )  and 2016 again got through HSC .

Does that show any discrepancy in my educational journey? 
Or background verification team just checks for your graduation marks ? Or will they ask me for more information before terminating me? If that happens :(
Please tell me

I passed 12th in 2018, and gave jee for the 1st time. Faired miserably and repeated a year and again gave it in 2019. Again didn't study properly and faired badly. Got into an okay okay private college called Heritage Institute of Technology in Kolkata. I'm studying ECE(Electronics and communication engineering) out there.

I've always wanted to study Computer science. With that in mind, I started trying to study discrete math from online resources. However, after finding the road too steep, I gave up. I thought, it'll be better to get a CS degree.

With that in mind, I decided to write Jee again.

In a private college, cracking GATE is my best option to go to a better place, but I doubt if I'll be capable enough to crack it and get into a better college. So I thought, better to write Jee again and try and get some private college with better placement opportunity so that I won't always be in uncertainty over my future.

But now, I don't know if this is the best decision. I don't know what to do. Whether to give up with Jee or continue. I sometimes feel embarrassed to give the exam again. I hate myself, my choices. I don't really know what I want from life. It's like I'm just doing things, not going anywhere - life has no direction.

I opted for science after the board exams. Realized I won't even pass, had to fight with family members to change it to Commerce and I passed with 57% marks. 

Came to Mumbai to study CA, Estimated around 2.5 lakhs as fees & Expenses.   Couldn't afford that.  I  had interest in technology so decided to pursue it instead. 

Learned computer engineering (hardware networking) for one year  and got a job at a MNC, worked in that field for 6 years. I was just 17 when Joining this Job & a Didn't complete my Graduation. 

Around 5th year in my job I realized I had more interest in building things on the internet than fixing active directory problems. 


I started learning more and more about it, and build a real blog which got decent visitors and started to make some money.  But to really make something worthwhile I had to dedicate more time.  

I used to live in Virar and traveling to Andheri (Mumbai) every day for job took 9 hrs + 4 hrs of my time and after that hectic peak hour mumbai local the body simply didn't want to work anymore.  

So in around 2013 I left my job and decided to move full time into Internet marketing. 
My wife, her parents and my Mom all thought I have gone mad and pretty stupid. And honestly That's pretty much fucked up if you ask any one of that age. 

For next 12 months I built websites around local businesses in UK , ranked them and sold the leads to two companies. The most successful of them was one was around heavy transport vehicle driving training. The company paid $35 per lead and I made more than $4K per month (around 2L in INR) with it.  

This boosted my confidence and I invested most of those funds into experimenting and investing in digital marketing. 

I used to post my screenshots on Facebook, In 2014 a random dude msged out of nowhere and asked to meet.   He looked confident and we meet at a Google conference later that Week.  

We discussed what we both has been doing. He had lots of contacts at emerging companies and I had the skills, strategies , and contacts to actually delivery successful marketing campaigns.   it was a promising match and we end up forming a company together. 

We built a digital agency, the first client he brought gave us over two crores in revenue. We quickly built a team of about 40 ninjas and went on to become a very successful company. 

In next 3 years We worked with more than a dozen listed companies, 3 fortune 500 company and made a lot of money for ourselves.  

At materialistic levels, just last year he bought a very expensive car (80 lakhs), travelled to over 30 countries and I bought  a expensive home (3BHK powai - 2.5 cr).  

We are still partners and have been doing great so far and hopefully will continue to. 

At multiple times in my career I had to fight with my own people, go against the wind to make my way.  

Point of all this is, you reddit guys are tech adopters and are technically more advanced than the general public.  There is a lot of people who are stuck at a job they hate but can't do shit about it. Either for family pressure or a dozen different reasons. 

For You, I strongly recommend that in your free time develop a skill - mostly in a area you enjoy doing , and use that skill to compliment your primary source of income. 
Once you are confident enough and have some numbers (revenue) to back it up, take a leap of faith and see where it takes.   


Don't worry about failure - If you fail, getting a job is the easiest thing to do.   

I agree that the being a  entrepreneur is volatile and there is no security but so is everything else.  Just see how many people gets fired everymonth with no where to go and they all wonder if they could make something like that. 

Parents ko bus paise chaiye. As long as they see you are making good enough,  they will be fine. Sooner or later.   My father in-law loves to flaunt when I share my photos with a BMW and mom makes dozens of calls telling all relatives whenever she purchase something expensive.

Science/Technology,Will the conflict between India and Pakistan ever come to an end?,1,eh3s70,thruaway593,9,"Will peace ever prevail between these two countries?

Since 1947, both countries have been fighting with each other over the issues like kashmir and have fought 4 bloody wars with each other wasting billions of dollars fighting with each other while the people in both countries are suffering because of poverty.

It only seems to getting worse whether it be some terrorist attacks from Pakistan or the stupid kashmir move done by the BJP govt. and increasing the unrest in that place.

Religious extremism is destroying both countries. Both countries seem to be obsessed with religion rather than prosperity and progress.

Imagine if both countries actually focused on development and progress rather than thinking of destroying each other.

Combined population of both the countries is about 1.6 Billion(160 crores) which is about one-fifth or 20% of human population. However more than a quarter of this population is illitrate and both of these countries are very backward when it comes to education, science and technology progress.

Imagine if both of these countries focused on investing in education, healthcare, building economic infrastructure, empowerment of women, increasing literacy rates to 100%, improved their education systems, focusing on economic development, building scientific among the population through proper education rather than fighting over Kashmir out of which nothing was gained, it only lead to deaths of thousands of soldiers of both countries and the suffering of people in Kashmir.

It would be so better if this one-fifth population also contributed to progress of humanity and utilized it's potential.

I'd like to see humanity become a Type 1 civilisation and this means contribution from this one-fifth of humanity is also important.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/eh3s70/will_the_conflict_between_india_and_pakistan_ever/

Ever since BJP has come to power, there has been systemic destruction of the nation's education system.  
Apart from few fancy Pradan Mantri Yojana's I honestly don't think BJP has done anything to improve the education system of the country. The latest attack of masked goons in JNU shows the condition of the Indian education system.   
Moreover, top BJP leader's have continuously attacked science and made unscientific statements in public trying to undermine rationality and scientific thinking.

> The BJP-led central governmenthas aggressively pursued the policies of commercialisation, centralisation and communalisation of education. It is accelerating the neo-liberal educational policies of the previous UPA government, aimed at deregulating the education sector and increasing the avenues of profit maximisation for the private capital. However, at the same time it is destroying the federal character of Indian education and is attempting to control the entire sector from the Centre, as part of the designs to push the Hindutva agenda. This is reflected in appointing RSS personnel in key administrative bodies, rewriting of history, abrupt and irrational changes in syllabi, propagation of pseudoscience, so on and so forth. The brunt of these attacks is falling upon the students from the socio-economically exploited and oppressed section.

1. How did you find the syllabus different from regular run of the mill engineering college.
1. How would you rate the seriousness and dedication of fellow students. 
1. The website tells me that most students do an internship at one of the ISRO facilities. Did you get such an opportunity ? How was your experience ? Did you contribute to an actual projects (even if in minuscule way)
1. And finally what's the employment situation like. Do a lot of people get absorbed into ISRO ? Do a lot of people like that or do you see a lot of ""brain drain"" ?

I'm in final year(about to give 7th sem exams) doing B.Tech in CSE from a tier 3 college.

My problem is I don't know where to put my time into.

From the people I have talked to, I know Data Structures, Algorithms and problem solving is a **must** for big companies and if I want to actually succeed in this industry but most of the job description of startups are like some knowledge of popular technologies like Java, Spring Boot, JDBC, Python, Django, React, Angular, Vue, Data  Science, Machine Learning and that too with a requirement of 1 or 2+ years.

I'm overwhelmed by everything! Though I'm already placed in an MNC with <4lpa package through campus placement, I want to get a better paying job as a software developer/engineer.

I have done some *not so fascinating* projects in Python and JavaScript but Idk if I should continue or just say fuck it to all the languages/frameworks etc and just invest my time into HackerRank, CodeChef, Codeforces etc but unfortunately a lot of good companies which ask for DSA problems don't even consider tier 3 grads so learning some stack then becomes kinda important to me. I don't know. 

I think a lot and then don't do shit. Pls tell me what should I do, where should I focus more to get a decent job now. I'll graduate next year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e2wq78/need_some_career_guidance_csit/

So, I've decided to give myself a 2 month deadline to decide what other career to choose. And withing one month of deciding, I'll quit my job and embark on that new career. But, as of now, I'm looking for various options and I'm wondering whether you guys can help. So, here's my background/interests to help you help me:

1) Education: BE in CS branch. Abysmal Percentage/GPA.

2) 2 years of experience in Software field, of which I have no interest to continue. Neither am I interested in Data Science/AI or whatever other crappy buzzword that often gets thrown around.

3) I'm interested in Sociology/History/Literature/Politics etc. Can spend whole day in front of a book. Can spend time without getting bored watching, reading about these topics.

4) I'm a bit shy and introverted, but I'm confident of overcoming those.

5) No pressure to earn more money. Would be satisfied with bear minimum of 10-20k per month.

Science/Technology,Let Us Begin the Next Decade Our Way,6,ehzmtp,futuoerectus,0,"Today, the end of a decade is upon us. While dates are just markers of time, they also have a psychological effect, the transition in to something new. On the eve of a new decade, this is my message to my fellow friends.

Friends,

Almost all of us have lived through the past decade. Some of you have even seen another momentous shift, ushering in the new millennium; while others have seen more of these events passing by.

The last ten years have redefined the way we live, and we are now even closer to each other. Things that were science fiction to a kid in the 1990s is a reality. Yet, we are using technology not to express ourselves but divide who we are collectively as humans. Algorithms are segmenting and compartmentalizing us on the basis of not only our ethnicity, but also our choices, our preferences and our actions. We are using all of the benefits of our interconnected ways in the worst ways possible; using it to gang up, humiliate and shame those that don't agree to our thoughts. We are still waging wars, and selling ourselves to be slaves for things that are pointless in the grand scheme of things.

However, today; you can stop that. You, yes you. You have the power to change, to redefine, to come together and fight all of the differences whose seeds are sown across our collective psyche. It is you who has the power to change your own life, and the power to change the lives of others around you. You may think you are an insignificant part amongst billions of people, but you're not. Today is the day you have the capability to lead by example, to create a harmonious future for the generation that comes after us, and most importantly, for yourself.

It is normal to fear, because I am afraid, more of myself and of failing others, but I am more afraid of failing to provide a better life for the next generation. But, it has to have a start somewhere, so why not today? I don't ask you of anything, but to do what your conscience thinks is right.

Thank you for reading.

Science/Technology,Indian Podcasts Recommendations,124,c9qqnc,madamplease,55,"I've seen a few posts asking for podcast recommendations, so here's a recommendation thread. This is not a comprehensive list (you can find a comprehensive list by /u/yogesh_calm [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/podcasts). While lists like that are great to have, it's hard to figure out whether a particular podcast is worth listening to.

**Manifesto**

&#x200B;

There are problems in the way we govern our country today and the political parties of today are too entrenched in their histories (dynasties, Hindutva, regionalism, casteism, communism, crony capitalism, et cetera) to be able to find the solutions India needs to move forward.

Indian humanist Party (IhP) is a facebook page for finding those solutions. We are not yet a political party and it may be years or even decades before we reach a critical mass. We see IhP as the forerunner of a political party that will one day govern India through humanist principles to build a happy, prosperous, clean, green, united, and safe country.

The principles of humanism include the primacy of fundamental human rights and using evidence-based rationality to make policy decisions.

**This is not an atheist organization.** The word 'humanist' as used above does not refer to 'secular humanism' but to the commitment that any interpretations of religious texts or any other ideologies that lead to the conclusion that violating fundamental human rights is justified will be considered unacceptable.

We believe that people should have freedom of belief and freedom from belief, but that the government and political parties should not be involved in propagating or inhibiting religion. That is a role we believe is best left for individuals and communities. The two principles of humanism that will be applied to all actions of the party are:

1. The primacy of fundamental human rights
2. Using evidence-based rationality and empathy as a foundation for decision making.

**It's time for India to move from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one.**

This is a 50-year project.

The RSS started nearly a century ago, in 1925, as a community of volunteers to create a Hindu rashtra as an alternative to the Congress vision of a secular India. In 1984 the BJP, a Hindutva inspired party, only won two seats, but over the last 35 years, it has replaced the Congress as the dominant force in the country’s politics.

Our goal is to learn from, and replicate the successes that the RSS and the BJP have enjoyed to help India transition from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one, one we believe we feel will more effective in achieving our goals. The goal is to actualize the original vision of the Congress of 1947 to build an inclusive secular progressive modern nation, but to learn from their mistakes, one of them possibly being to focus on group identities rather than treating voters as individuals. We believe that this has led to communal voting blocks, polarization, and the inevitable emergence of a majority-minority narrative that is the unhelpful frame for almost all political conversations today.

**Metrics driven**

We will set, communicate, and measure our progress against tangible measurable goals. They will include our rankings on internationally recognized reports:

1. World Happiness Report (current ranking 122/145)
2. Human development index (current ranking 130/189)
3. GDP per capita (current ranking 120/181 as per the World Bank)
4. Education index (current ranking 112/188)
5. Life expectancy (current ranking 125/183)
6. Corruption perceptions index (current ranking 78/180)
7. Global peace index (current ranking 136/163)
8. Press freedom index (current ranking 140/180)
9. Gini coefficient of inequality (current ranking 99/158 as per the World Bank)
10. Gender equality report (87/144)

We will find ways to ensure that state and local equivalents of these metrics are defined and monitored to measure objective performance of PMs, CMs, down to local officials, and we will find a way to ensure a third-party audit of these numbers gives assurance to the public that we are being transparent and honest about the progress or lack of progress we have made on these fronts. We will never knowingly present factually incorrect data to the public.

**We are agnostic with respect to economic ideology**

Capitalism has created wealth and prosperity for many nations and as a general rule, we would like to move to a more liberalized economy which we believe will improve the quality of the citizens of the country, compared to a more government controlled environment. However unchecked capitalism can create perpetual inequalities in society and have an extremely damaging effect on the environment, pollution levels, and ultimately our health and life expectancy. And therefore we believe that there must be state support for the most vulnerable members of our society and state protection of the environment. We will make case by case decisions therefore based on discussion and debates on the pros of specific economic policies. In all cases, we will use data and expert advice to make decisions that best balance the competing demands of economic growth, reducing poverty and inequality, and protecting the environment.

**We are committed to internal democracy**

As a party, we will have regular elections to determine who will lead the party every 5 years. There will be term limits of 10 years with respect to the leadership. However to change the manifesto itself we would use a 2/3rds majority with 75% quorum of party members.

**National security**

We will work towards peacefully agreeing internationally recognized borders with our neighbors - China, Pakistan, Bangladesh. This could be bilaterally or with the help of external bodies such as the United Nations. The final decision is unlikely to be one that will make everyone happy on both sides of the border, but too many lives have been lost in all countries, and we want to find more productive ways of engaging with our neighbors. We will not cross the border to invade land or to attack people. We will improve our intelligence and defense capabilities in order to make up for the lack of strategic options that this decision would entail. We will not use torture or indefinite imprisonment as an instrument of state policy. We will continue to treat Kashmir as an integral part of India, we don’t believe that plebiscite is politically feasible stance for a party to hold in India, if it wants to get elected. Our goal will be to normalize the situation with respect to safety and economic growth so that the people of Kashmir trust the Indian government enough to voluntarily vote out Section 370 so they can benefit from a greater integration with the rest of India.

**Caste and reservations**

We absolutely stand against caste discrimination and at the same time we do not believe that reservations are a solution to caste discrimination. The vast majority of jobs are in the informal and private sectors where reservations don’t apply. The government only accounts for 3-4% of jobs. But as a result of the controversy on what percentage of jobs/educational places should be reserved an entire brand of politics has emerged that focuses on reservations and this has cemented caste identities into place indefinitely, and perhaps for eternity. This has led to zero-sum caste-based electoral politics that distract from the issues of clean drinking water, jobs, law, and order, etc. And the people who suffer most from this in our opinion are the most vulnerable individuals associated with lower castes.

Over 70 years after independence the Dalits are perhaps among the poorest 200 million people in the world. We believe the solution to the caste problem is world class primary education. When penniless immigrants enter Scandinavian countries, their children get free education of such high quality that within a generation they are able to live lives of dignity and possibility. This along with a stringent focus on ensuring that violence against any individual is promptly acted on will, we believe, be a more sustainable and effective solution to the legacy of the caste system. We also recognize that this is not yet a politically viable solution and that many Dalits will understandably feel that something is being taken away from people of their community on the assumption that caste prejudices will fade away by themselves, of which there is no persuasive evidence.

Our approach would, therefore, be to leave any reservations as they currently exist untouched. We would instead focus our energy on investing in education and law and order, till the trust levels are built up among Dalits, etc. in the viability of this pathway and buying into the proposal that disbanding the reservations system is the way to ending the caste system once and for all.

**Freedom of speech and the standard of discourse**

We believe that freedom of speech is the foundation of healthy democracies. We will work to improve our Press Freedom Index from 140/180. We will never use jail, legal means, and certainly not violence, to curb any individual or body for their criticisms of our work if we get elected. Even if they are making factually incorrect statements or deliberately lying. We will have unscripted unmoderated press conferences with all major newspapers and channels at least once in a month so they can subject our policies and decisions to a full and frank inquiry. We will have no restrictions on freedom of speech with the exception of credible incitement to violence and deliberate lies to defame private individuals and businesses.

Individuals and businesses with net assets of more than Rs 1,000 crores will not be liable to protect themselves from defamation except from other individuals who are also above that threshold. This is to prevent rich individuals and businesses to use expensive lawyers to stifle any criticism of their practices by common people. We believe that they are insulated from the effects of malicious rumors but the benefit of talking about corporate or industrial corruption more openly will be of disproportionate benefit to the society. We will work for the removal of blasphemy laws and laws to do with seditious and anti-national speech. We believe that both gods, if they exist, and the country if it is being run fairly, are strong enough to withstand criticism. We will never brand anybody who disagrees with us an anti-national, we will assume they have a different idea of what is best for the people of the country and we will share our views on the matter.

**Science and business**

We will make a concerted attempt to place ourselves at the forefront of technological advancements in the world and to profit from this through world-class businesses. We want India to be at a place where it can contribute technologically superior products like Apple, Samsung, Nokia, Sony. We want India to be a place where Nobel Prize winners in the Sciences come from. We’re fed up of being a developing nation. We want to be a contributing nation.

Science/Technology,Encryption Pe Charcha: A Public Lecture by Dr. Manoj Prabhakaran | November 23 | 6:30 PM | Constitution Club of India,7,dzz6e1,InternetFreedomIn,0,"&#x200B;

Are you tired of simplistic lock and key analogies which pervade most legal and policy discourse surrounding encryption? The last year has seen encryption technologies become a subject of intense discussion in courts and within the government. In India and several other countries, there are demands to weaken encryption through backdoors and key escrow systems to facilitate easier access to information for law enforcement agencies. At the same time, encryption is also one of the few tools available to individuals to protect themselves from surveillance by Big Brother and Big Tech. 

To bring greater clarity and technical rigour to the public discourse surrounding encryption, Internet Freedom Foundation is hosting a lecture on **‘Encryption, Security and Privacy in the Digital Age’** by **Dr. Manoj Prabhakaran** on **Saturday, 23 November 2019** from **6:30 PM to 8:00 PM** at the **Constitution Club, New Delhi**. Dr. Prabhakaran is a Chair Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay and he specialises in cryptography. Through this public lecture, Dr. Prabhakaran will explain the technical aspects of encryption in a comprehensible but nuanced manner and discuss the importance of cybersecurity and online privacy in light of contemporary developments.

We would be delighted if you could join us for the public lecture and [**you can register for the event here**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/encryption-pe-charcha-a-public-lecture-by-dr-manoj-prabhakaran-tickets-81279764965).

Science/Technology,[PSA] A Guide to Jobs in the field of Computer Science for Engineering Students in pre-final / final year,292,bggn06,FanneyKhan,52,"  

**Statutory Warning: I work with a lot of students in the final and pre-final year of engineering and all of the interview experiences I’ve gathered is from their personal experience. While making this thread, I have consulted multiple people who work for product based, service based and start-up companies to know about their work experience and pay scale. I’ve also used LinkedIn salary and Glassdoor Salary / reviews to support my words. I am willing to modify anything if you think it is wrong!**

I see a lot of threads every week asking about the job scene in India and how to get in. I will try to put everything I know in this post. 

**Companies** 

I classify companies into 3 types

1. Product Based
2. Service Based
3. Startups

# Product Based Companies

**What are they?**

These are companies that make their own products and sell software or integration or both. Most of the “apps” that you see are examples of product based companies. Generally, it is believed that a product based company is what an engineer should aim to get into because you will be working on making a product than using the product in most cases. You will be directly involved in developing or testing a product that your company made and the chances to be exposed to the best technologies is greater

**What do they need?**

Usually in a product based firm, the training is on the job. Nobody is going to hold your hand and tell you what to do. The training will be a bunch of online videos or MOOC or just documentation(s) that you are supposed to read and figure out what you have to do. Since the job profile is going to be like this, they expect someone who can code. You should have a strong hold in at least one programming language and some companies also demand good Object-Oriented Programming skills.

**Selection Process**

Most of the good companies hire from campuses of good colleges. There will be an online platform (like [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)) where you are given 2 to 3 questions. The first question is going to be an easy question to test if you can write code. The 2nd and 3rd question will aim to test your CS concepts mainly Algorithms. The 2nd question will be of medium difficulty and will usually have a brute force way to solve and an optimized way. Coding a brute force method will get you half the marks as the complex test cases will timeout. The 3rd question is usually meant to test your knowledge of implementing algorithms and problem-solving skills.

Some companies (like Uber, CodeNation, etc) hire from platforms like [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/) and do not really look at what college you come from. But there is always a clause of minimum 60% academic score in most of the product based companies. Some companies take this a stretch further and even have a cut-off on 10th and 12th marks.

Linkedin jobs and Glassdoor jobs are also a good place to look out, but the response from these portals are a little slow in India!

**Interview Experience**

Once you clear the coding round, you will be shortlisted for an interview. In an interview, you will be given a problem. The problem can be a CS problem (algorithms and Data Structures) or a design problem. You are given time to think about it and they don’t usually expect you to code out a solution on the computer. You can write pseudo code and you can and MUST always share your thinking.

Some interviewers are going to give you a vague question and expect you to ask questions for more clarity. No question is a stupid question. Each interview lasts anywhere between 10 minutes to 40 minutes. Nobody is expecting a complete, correct and verifiable solution, but you cannot give totally wrong solutions.

You might be additionally quizzed on your resume. They might ask you in-depth questions about every project you have written there and ask you to justify the need for that project, why you chose the technologies, what did you learn, what were the difficulties you faced, etc. Sometimes, they might even ask you some questions related to the technologies you have mentioned on your resume.

You might have anywhere between 1 to 6 such rounds after which you will have a HR round.

Some companies use these rounds to filter candidates (i.e. only a certain number of candidates go from one round to the other) and the other companies give you a score every round and decide at the end. So, stay calm and don’t be overconfident just because you’re clearing rounds.

**How do I prepare for this?**

If you’re in college, focus in class. Subjects like Algorithms and Data Structures are qualifiers to get an interview. Once inside, you will be quizzed on Algorithms (80-85%) and the remaining 15-20% you will be asked about DBMS & Computer Networks (depending on companies)

If you did not focus on these subjects, get onto platforms like [InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/) / [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)/ [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/) and start solving. If you can solve a significant chunk of questions here, start solving questions from [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)/ [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) / /r/dailyprogrammer. You can also take MIT's course on Design and Analysis of Algorithm [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-046j-design-and-analysis-of-algorithms-spring-2015/). Some of the favorite questions are about Dynamic Programming, Trees, Hashing and Graphs.

**Salary & Benefits**

You can’t put a cap on salary on a product based firm. You can get anywhere between 6LPA to 12LPA (or more) as a base salary. It depends on companies. Check GlassDoor for reviews, know what the company does and see if your interests align with the company’s interest. Have a look at their official websites, know about their products and research before you go attend an interview. 

# Service Based Companies

**What are they?**

They’re companies that use the products that are available in the market and provide a service to a client. Some service based companies have developed their own products also, but most of the money in such companies comes from providing a service to a customer. Ex : Cognizant, TCS, etc

**What do they need?**

These companies are looking for someone who can wear multiple hats. When you are interviewing (as a fresher) to a service based companies, you will likely be hired under an umbrella role of “Associate” or “Engineer”. You might get into development, testing or support. Support isn’t the kind where you have to work in a call center, but its not a primarily engineering job either. The pay is less but the role can be fun depending on how much you put into work. You will have a wide array of options to come up in your career and nobody will expect a lot from you. At least not like the product based companies! 

**Selection Process**

Call for interviews are usually through walk-in interviews or an aptitude test. You will have to search websites that carter to jobs for freshers. ([TimesJobs](https://www.timesjobs.com/), [FirstNaukri](https://www.firstnaukri.com/), etc). You should be looking for an open-for-all kind of test. TCS has their own annual hiring tests, so you will have to follow TCS to know the dates. Infosys does hiring through open-to-all aptitude tests. You can also find information on the Careers section of these companies. Some smaller companies offer walk-in interviews or are found in job fairs.

Tests like [AMCAT](https://www.myamcat.com/) also help you get interview calls. [AMCAT](https://www.myamcat.com/) tests you for basic arithmetic aptitude, English comprehension skills, logic and reasoning skills, etc. You get a score and you wait for companies to call you for interview after [AMCAT](https://www.myamcat.com/). 

There are also “coaching” institutes that teach you basic programming and offer you a 100% job guarantee. Most of the time, these jobs are for service based companies. The coaching fees can be anywhere between 10k to 25k. 

**Do you research before you pay for any service, don’t take my word for it**

A good entry point here is reference. If you know someone working for the company, you can get a referral and get an interview. This is very much valid here and a great percentage of hiring happens through referrals also. Many service based companies leverage your attitude over your skills. Some exploit your desperation to get you in for a lower pay.

**Interview Experience**

There isn’t a standard practice for interviews in a service based company. It basically depends on your interviewer. I know people who were asked a lot of theory questions based on their field of engineering even though the company had nothing to do with that field. But I also know people who were just asked HR-round questions like “Why do you want to join this company?” and “How would you tackle X scenario?” 

So pray to your favorite God(s) and Goddess(es) before you go for an interview. Read up about interview experiences for the company on [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.co.in/index.htm) and [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/interview-experiences/) to get a rough idea of the kind of questions they might ask. Don’t be nervous!

**How to prepare?**

Basic aptitude and sometimes basic coding is what these companies look for. Basic coding means you should be able to understand what for/while/if-else if-else constructs do and maybe write a code to sort an array. Refer [IndiaBix](https://indiabix.com) for aptitude and take a programming language tutorial on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com). (You’re better off with [C++](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp) or [Java](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java), but if you find them difficult start with [Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python). But, eventually, move to [C++](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp)/[Java](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java) any one). Aim at getting 3 or 4 stars on [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com)!

**Salary & Benefits**

Salary can be from the range of 3 lpa to 6lpa depending on your company and interview. There is a scope of coming up in the job, but there is also a scope of getting frustrated with the job. Your job MIGHT be something as simple as forwarding tickets or something complex like fixing code or managing a service fault. But, what will get you up in this field is your dedication to work and patience. It is easier to climb into management in a service based company than it is in a product based company. While it is easier, it isn’t necessarily faster. It’s a very slow process and will take some time. So, if you lack patience or if you are looking to do a specific field of work (like, development only), this job isn’t for you.

Its relatively relaxing and you are a fish in an ocean, so the expectation the upper management has from you isn’t very high! You’ve standard benefits like insurance, variable pay / bonus, cab facility, etc. But don’t expect to be pampered :P

# Startups

**What are they?**

These are usually very small, very new companies that are in the prototype stage. They’ve just got their service out in the market. They’re MOSTLY a product-based company. They’re new, they’re young, they’re not making a lot of money currently, but they promise something big in the future.

**What do they need?**

Young, talented people who work without a lot of hand-holding. It helps if you’ve worked on technologies that they are looking for. A lot of companies use open-source tech, so its not something you need to go to classes to be trained in. Obviously, you must be able to take a lot of responsibility and write good quality code as your mentor will not be looking at every line of your code.

You are given a lot of independence, but you have a lot of responsibility too!

**Selection process**

If a start-up is coming on-campus, then they’re going to go the product company way and kick in some [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com) tests. There is no single way a start-up hires. Sometimes, you will be able to get in by just calling them up and asking for an internship or emailing the HR or contacting the HR on LinkedIn. In smaller companies, you can even get in touch with the founders via LinkedIn and ask for an opportunity.

A lot of the start-ups are on [AngelList](https://angel.co/) and that can be your starting point. I think it is right to add that not all start-ups are innovative. Some “start-ups” aren’t really centers of innovation, but are only for money making. Today, if you open a coaching class that will train students in technology, you can get away by calling it a start-up. So, do your research about the company. If it is a very new company and has very few people, that isn’t usually a great company to start off with, unless, you are really interested in working on the product they have.

You can also keep a look out of Internship Fairs. A lot of the HR teams attend such fairs to hire graduates / students.

**Interview Experience**

Your interview experience will mostly likely be similar to a product company interview but not as strict. There is a mixture of skill and attitude that is considered. But if you are a complete noob, don’t expect to be hired by a start-up as they can’t afford to train you fully. You need to have some experience in some field of CS. Be it data science, application development, web development or machine learning. This is to demonstrate your ability to learn independently.

**How to Prepare?**

Hands-on, Hands-on, Hands-on! Grab a field you are interested in, go about solving small problems. The problems you solve can be as small as writing a script to automatically book tickets for the latest Avengers movie or as complex as creating a robot that can extinguish fire autonomously. 

Get good or get out!

**Salary and Benefits**

The salary isn’t standard. It depends on how old the company is, how much funding they have and how many employees are there. So, you can’t put a range. It can be as low as a service based company pays, it can be higher than what a product based company pays.

The work environment will give you a lot of independence. The offices will be more employee-friendly, you will not have someone monitoring you like a watchman 24x7 and you will not have strict policies that you’ve to adhere too. Your manager and higher management will be more approachable if you ever need to discuss something.

But at the same time, there is responsibilities too. I am reiterating this because the kind of independence you get can be a bad thing if you are used to hand-holding. This is because hand-holding is done in every step of school and college in India, either by teachers, parents or peers! That might not necessarily be the case with start-ups.

I will be writing more on Skill development, freelancing, switching jobs, etc ! Stay tuned and let me know what you thought about this. :D",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bggn06/psa_a_guide_to_jobs_in_the_field_of_computer/
Science/Technology,"IFF submits comments to the Standing Committee on Science & Tech highlighting worries with the DNA Bill, 2019.",6,dygb7l,InternetFreedomIn,0,"## 

https://preview.redd.it/d72pn1hu0lz31.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4991e7d0a5538ee0d02b5efbffb901dcb86ffd34

## Tl;dr

The DNA Bill is back. The DNA Bill aims to regulate the use and outputs of DNA technology in certain cases and has been the subject of many a debate. It was introduced once again in July 2019 in the Lok Sabha after having lapsed in 2018. It was then referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee of Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change on October 18.  The Committee invited comments on the Bill till November 18 and oh, did we have a lot of comments.

## What's it all about?

India has been attempting to introduce legislation that regulates DNA technology since the early 2000's but thankfully has been largely unsuccessful until recently, making our fears quite real. The current DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2019 has seen a number of redrafts bringing it to its present form and yet continues to be problematic.

We're grateful to be able to voice these concerns as the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change has invited comments on the Bill after it was referred to them. Unfortunately, as submissions made cannot be fully public prior to the Committee publishing their report, so we highlight our major concerns to give you an understanding of why we think the DNA Bill not only needs to undergo further work but also needs to be introduced only after a solid data protection law is in place.

## A few of our very many concerns

* *No data protection legislative framework*: With no overarching data protection legislation in India, the lack of obligation within the Bill to ensure protection especially by the DNA Laboratory as a either mere collectors or even processors of the DNA collected, have no alternative safeguards in place to remedy data breaches or ensure informed consent. Similarly, there is nothing to govern the sharing of such sensitive data, ensuring purpose limitation is maintained.
* *Profiling and surveillance:* DNA profiles can reveal extremely sensitive information about an individual such as their skin colour, illness, susceptibility to diseases and any access to such intrusive information can be misused to specifically target individuals with their own genetic data and is particularly worrying as it could be used to incorrectly link a particular caste/community to criminal activities. Further, in the event that such a databases are then linked to others worrying databases in existence, it is bound to give rise to Government conducted mass surveillance.
* *Overbroad provisions:* Our submission tackles the lack of legitimate use by the Bill; it indicates that DNA technology intends to be used for extremely wide criminal and civil purposes (**alarm bells are ringing**). We argue that the Bill as such extensive databasing of DNA data requires to meet the conditions set by the Supreme Court's judgement in Puttaswamy of which one is a greater public purpose, the databasing of DNA used in civil cases does not fulfill this criteria. Further, even within criminal cases, there is need to limit the collection of DNA to the investigation and prosecution of cognizable crimes to ensure the data in the DNA database is minimal and controlled.

The submission details a plethora of other concerns ranging from lack of privacy safeguards such as no informed consent, storage and sharing of information and the power of the DNA profiling board.

We are grateful that the Committee has invited non-official witnesses/experts to provide their views on November 27 and hope that both written and oral submissions that come their way will be taken into strong consideration, resulting in the suggestion of a much required revising of the Bill.

Science/Technology,Why is learning programming the de facto advice in this sub?,145,biwylz,WhereIsLifeTakingMe2,57,"Hi everyone! I am curious about the ground reality of people saying ""learn coding"" to get a job.

In this sub whenever I see a post that is made by a teenager struggling to find a job, be it people who already graduated, seniors in college or even freaking 12th grade students who couldn't get into prestigious colleges, people always seem to suggest them to try their hands on programming.

I feel this advice is misguided for anyone except college seniors. Working in the software industry requires you to have formal knowledge about the underpinning of various technologies. And this can only be acquired by going through a formal curriculum. Seniors from other majors can pick up on this quickly as most of them have had an introductory class on computer science in their freshman year and have batchmates who are computer science majors. I have seen many non computer science majors being placed in reputed companies by ""learning coding"" in their senior year.

But when we talk about the ones who have already graduated, it becomes tremendously hard to gather resources and devote time to go through those courses. Even if someone does do that, I can't seem to understand on why a recruiter might trust you on your skills. Having a degree and internships is what leads you to a company. I think unpaid internships would be a starter for this section of job seekers. But it would be a long term payout to get a paid job and I think one can definitely do a better job to get immediate returns rather than focusing on programming.

Finally, what made me write this post today is people suggesting it to someone who couldn't score well in JEE MAINS. Most probably the OP for that post hasn't had any prior introduction to programming. Doesn't this tantamount to society's misguided opinion of engineering/medical being the only path to success. Heck, we narrowed it down to programming on this sub. I do realise it is just a suggestion, but I feel this restricts him from exploring his own interests. Not scoring well in entrance exams could be a red herring that he is on the wrong path. Maybe that is what needs amends.

I would love to stand corrected on my views. Please share your opinions on why we collectively do so.

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/biwylz/why_is_learning_programming_the_de_facto_advice/
Science/Technology,Action-Packed Hearing in Facebook's Transfer Petition before the Supreme Court.,37,d8lb6i,InternetFreedomIn,2," 

https://preview.redd.it/vk8zcbb4sio31.jpg?width=389&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b81169a3f60ecc89d246db99901cf18b1024cabb

**24 September 2019:** In today's hearing before the Supreme Court in Facebook's transfer petition seeking transfer of *Antony Clement Rubin v. Union of India* from the Madras High Court to the Supreme Court, extensive arguments were made by the parties on whether technical and complex issues involving encryption should be addressed by the judiciary.

On 23.09.2019, IFF filed its response to Facebook's transfer petition and reiterated that while it believes such problems should be addressed by the legislative and executive branches of government, the Supreme Court should not curtail the jurisdiction of High Courts to entertain writ petitions by ordinary Indian internet users against large multinational tech companies. Ordinary Indian internet users residing in different parts of the country should be allowed to approach their State High Courts if their fundamental rights are violated by Big Tech because most Indians do not have the resources to initiate litigation in the Supreme Court. While we believe that the prayers in *Antony Clement Rubin v. Union of India* are misguided and strongly oppose any attempts to weaken encryption, it is also important to preserve access to justice for aggrieved citizens.

During today's hearing, the bench once again inquired about the status of the Draft Intermediaries Guidelines Rules which have been in the pipeline since December 2018. The Counsel for the Central Government clarified that the policy formulation process was underway and ""special suggestions"" were being sought to revise the Rules. However, he stated that a specific timeline for notification of the Rules could not be provided. The Bench comprising of Deepak Gupta J. and Aniruddha Bose J. noted that while misuse of technology is a serious concern, such technical and complex issues are best addressed by the executive branch.

The Counsel for the State of Tamil Nadu insisted that WhatsApp was trying to avoid complying with Indian law by stating that it does not have the technology to identify the originator of information on its platform but this was not true since Dr. Kamakoti who is a Professor at IIT Madras had provided a technical solution to enable tracing of originator. In response, Senior Advocate Mr. Kapil Sibal appearing for WhatsApp stated that another IIT Professor had disagreed with Dr. Kamakoti's proposed solution. This was a reference to the expert report by Dr. Manoj Prabhakaran from IIT Bombay that IFF had previously filed before the Madras High Court. Read more about it [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/iff-files-independent-expert-submission-before-madras-hc/).

After hearing these submissions, the Court noted that such complex issues need to be decided in consultation with technical experts and the judiciary cannot be expected to implement such changes. The Court emphasized that while policy formulation was within the domain of the executive, any policy formulated by the government is subject to judicial scrutiny to ensure that it does not undermine the right to privacy. Since the Draft Intermediaries Guidelines Rules are being actively considered by the Government, the Court adjourned the matter till 22.10.2019. It further directed the Solicitor General to file an affidavit by the Secretary of MeitY within 3 weeks about the status of the Rules and provide a definite timeline about when the process will be completed.

IFF's Executive Director, Mr. Apar Gupta said the following about IFF's stance in today's hearing:

>""IFF represents Indian internet users and their fundamental rights, and not Big Tech. This requires us to take principled positions on what’s the best outcome possible in tough and complex situations.  
Ordinary internet users should have the ability to approach local judicial forums against Big Tech and will lack the financial capacity and resources to travel from remote places in India to judicial forums such as the Supreme Court of India at New Delhi.  This is separate from our substantive position which we have explained and our stance has been taken after considerable deliberation and inputs from our external team of lawyers.  
Just like we have filed a technical submission opposing traceability in the Hon'ble Madras High Court, we also opposed the transfer petition after receiving legal advice. According to us, it is best to contest the demand for traceability or social media regulations before the Hon'ble High Court. The High Court judgement will of course be subject to appeal if parties are aggrieved and the transfer petition is dismissed.    
Ultimately foregrounding all of this is our defense of the standards of the Shreya Singhal judgement. This is why we recommend that such complex questions that rest on technical aspects of computer science should be settled by executive and legislative processes rather than through courts. Any such legislative changes or regulations are also similarly open to judicial challenge if they undermine fundamental rights.""

The next hearing in the transfer petition is on 22 October 2019 and we will keep you updated about how this important case progresses. IFF was represented in today's hearing by Udayaditya Banerjee, Ria Singh Sawhney and S. Prasanna, and we are extremely grateful for their continued support.

Science/Technology,"An Appeal: Please, do not jail PUBG users.",298,b0yd99,InternetFreedomIn,73,"We cannot believe we are writing this. As per media reports which surfaced yesterday the Rajkot Police Department has arrested 7 youths for playing the PUBG online video game. Clearly things have spiralled out of control.

## A contested public debate

PUBG entered the mainstream lexicon in which the Hon'ble Prime Minister on January 29, 2019 while interacting with the concerns of a parent referred to it jovially. He clearly indicated in his remarks that, ""[*technology is a problem -- as well as a solution*](https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/yeh-pubg-waala-hai-kya-pm-modi-aware-of-pubg-and-fortnite-addiction-offers-tips-on-how-to-deal-with-it-1442411-2019-01-30)"" and suggested patience and guidance as an approach for encouraging children to use their time productively. Alongside these remarks advisories were being issued by Child and Adolescent welfare bodies in some states including [Delhi](https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/top-story/is-pubg-a-menace-delhi-child-rights-panel-says-game-negatively-impacts-kids/story/317245.html) and [Gujarat](https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science/article/pubg-addiction-gujarat-government-issues-notice-to-ban-students-from-playing-pubg-or-any-other-addictive-game/352324) that the game was addictive and could cause negative impacts on children even beyond their academic performance.

It is important to take a step back this moment and consider the wider academic literature on the subject. The top three cited meta studies on Google Scholar on the general impact of gaming on adolescents indicate varying outcomes. Some even suggest benefits such as development and improvement of hand eye co-ordination (*remember the old Atari's?*).

https://preview.redd.it/nfpahf4632m21.png?width=549&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ffc8afca6b06ee2d8eae6a26267b616a03d157a

Yes, we may be completely wrong in an our inferences, but believe that this may be a matter for parental caution, and social debate but certainly not penal law. We explain the dangerous consequences of approaching this as a legal issue below.

## Prohibitory Order on playing PUBG

The Rajkot Police Commissioner has issued a prohibitory order under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 on March 6, 2019. A Section 144 order under the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 is usually made to prevent illegal physical assemblies a breach of peace. While large numbers of online gamers do congregate and spend long hours in front of their smartphones or gaming consoles much to the annoyance of their friends and family such assemblies are rarely unlawful. It would be a stretch to call such activities as threatening public order.

Hence, we were surprised when a Kumar Manish posted this tweet:

We have today been able to have a [rough translation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16xDu9OqcEmEq8fRupJmcORiJv0wfpVvR/view?usp=sharing) prepared in English thanks to the help offered by Manan Bhatt.

From reading the prohibitory order, it is reasonable to infer that as per press reports, 7 youths ranging from the ages of 19 to 26 have been arrested for the breach of this prohibitory order. At this point we found ourselves bewildered and taken aback as this is seemingly a grave attack on personal liberty. We believe as the Hon'ble Prime Minister noted in his conversation that concerns on online gaming are better handled with the care and affection of a parent and teachers. Certainly not by creating fear of penal law, through prohibitory orders issued by the police and subsequent arrests. This is not only abhorrent to sensibility but offends our core fundamental rights as it lacks rationality and the reasonableness necessary in any restriction imposed by the State.

In the coming days we will be sourcing and authenticating information and taking steps including talking to a legal team based out of Gujarat. We hope to address this issue responsibly and meanwhile urge the Gujarat government to look into this matter urgently. We appeal to them -- *jailing people should not be a game*.

Science/Technology,[Rant] I'm seriously tired of this is so called education,13,ctzkd1,throwaway93681,6,"This is mostly your weekly education rant, nothing new. Throwaway account since I'd like to stay anonymous and wanted to let my thoughts out in the open.

A bit about me first. I loved computers from a pretty young age but at the time I simply loved it as a hobby. I also remember the young me reading tons of books on topics like space and nature. The only thing I was good at my middle school was Physics and Computer Science but kinda ignored all the other subjects. I also loved helping other students with these subjects to the extent teachers would point out to me with ""stop being so noisy"" and ""get back to your seat"" kind of synonyms. I was pretty open to the future wondering what it held for me. Anyway, I decided to pick up Engineering.

Everything has been going in a downward spiral since then. As any typical kid in India trying to get into a good Engineering college, I went to these so called JEE coaching classes. These places were so horrible. Over time, I realised that these coaching classes are simply forcing down material onto their students. If there was some actual learning happening in there, given the vast syllabus, it wouldn't be so surprising whenever a high school kid from India marked an innovation in science. Rather we see students killing themselves for not being able to score good marks in the examination. There is such an intense pressure on kids since you're constantly being told that not making into a good college equates to no woman marrying you and you're going to be working an awful job, if not jobless. In short, your life is going to become so fucked up that we see kids already making peace with death instead. And then out there are some fucking assholes who feel that this is helping in reducing the population of our country by weeding out the unworthy. Just stop making kids at the rate you shit, fuckheads. Instead of making a positive effect in the country, these coaching centres asking for a shitload of money are simply saturating the already saturated field of Engineering in India. Some parents also force their kids to these coaching centres just because of their faculty flaunting their achievements as if they are a God's gift to this world. Anyway, these coaching centres are just a symptom of the core problem of how most reputed colleges in India accept students solely on the basis of one or two examinations and how colleges like to be seduced into being an AICTE approved college. This whole education thing has turned into fucking business.

I failed my JEE since I couldn't keep up. The failure doesn't hurt me, partially because it is my way of rejecting this system. I've come to a realisation that I cannot learn things solely by books and paper, I need to experience it in reality, or I cannot digest anything. Which is why I was probably good in and loved Physics and Computer Science. It costs virtually nothing to see things in motion and see that the equations really do match up, and write computer programs to do stuff for you and everything makes sense. The thing is that doing everything in such a way consumes a lot of time, but I feel it is worth it. It's extremely hard to work on all the high school concepts here and look out for their real world significance at the same time, all when the examinations are pretty much all formulae and rote based.

Anyway, I joined a tier-3 college hoping to at least make it nice in Computer Science since all you need is a Computer to experience anything. But oh lord fuck this place. Just so you know, I spent my high school years learning to program by writing small scripts to manipulate my environment and eventually, I started working with other people to make open-source software. So all this helped me get into GSoC in my very first year of college and worked with some genuine people working hard to make a positive impact to this world. If not for GSoC, I'd also have been forced to attend the ""summer training"" to ""learn HTML & CSS"" along with other students in the college itself, where the students are kept idle for like half the session and you know what all restrictions they put on even when you are idle - no phones, no YouTube, no heads down for taking a break, no talking to other students (seriously?!). I had another friend of mine who did GSoC in the 2nd year but you know what, students were supposed to ""attend a training institute"" by paying the institute money during this summer break but apparently his GSoC wasn't considered since it was seen as an online course (as opposed to going and attending a training institute) by our Head of Department. So, rejected. Poor guy still had to pay a private institute for his forged training certificate despite of working so hard and lie that he worked on both his training and his GSoC project.

I'll talk about some more wonders here. Our college has so called Soft Skills sessions where instead of learning how to communicate properly with other people, you are simply taught how to flaunt and bluff every little thing to everyone and speak hollow words to ""impress"" other people (since in the end, this college only cares about to headline the highest number of placements offered in the Limca Book of Records). Rather than receiving proper technical knowledge, we spend time practising aptitude questions. Many students here have difficulty communicating, structuring grammar and forming sentences in simple English due to their unfortunate backgrounds and yet no work is ever done to help those students become proficient. It's been 3 semesters since we've been studying about Software Engineering and Software Testing to learn the craft of creating and maintain a software, and literally not a single fucking line of code yet! Most students still believe all that there is to testing a software is looking for bugs by hand. There hasn't even been a mention of automated tests and sort till date and I am 3 years in. And, if the authorities find any students good in solving aptitude questions, they are going to differentiate them by making them solve CodeChef problems in extra classes as if remaining students are merely a possession to the college for the time.

We are assigned to work on a team project every semester and are evaluated by professors who have no experience in the said technology the project is based on. These professors then end up judging students by asking standardised definitions from the desired technology in the final viva instead of actually evaluating by asking project specific questions. No wonder the majority of students steal from GitHub or copy-paste projects from their peers, no one cares. Also, the assignment questions are so blunt with hardly any thinking involved, you can look them up and boom you get full marks if you submitted it on time. Now, I could keep listing whatever the hell is wrong here: Minimum attendance: 75% or no exams for you. Students are forced to stay seated and their heads up even if the concerned subject teacher is on leave and the substitute teacher has nothing to teach about. Internet/WiFi is censored by some company called FortiGuard, anyway the Internet hardly works here. Can't eat, roam or leave the campus before 12 noon. Worst of all, there are students who have been so brainwashed that they blindly trust the authorities just because they believe the faculty is truly full of professionals and are the ones who can help them get a job if they keep repeating their words. We aren't really learning anything here of actual use.

I don't even know whether this is the situation for most colleges in India or I just happen to be in one.

Now here is me who helps with some really nice open-source projects, writes technical posts trying my best not to repeat what the Internet already knows, fighting censorship, trying to help my peers and random internet people with anything technical whenever possible, just because I like to care about people.  All this when college eats up my 9+ hours (including commute) everyday, I really feel like a fucking idiot now. What am I even doing. I don't even want to bother with money or be a rich man, just enough to feed myself or if a family happens someday. This shit has been so sickening lately that I've started doubting that it's just me who the real asshole here is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ctzkd1/rant_im_seriously_tired_of_this_is_so_called/
Science/Technology,[Guide] Building your resume while in college as a CS Engineering student [Part 1 / 4],35,c87jbg,RejectedCoder,13,"This is a guide that I wanted to write since a long time and I was inspired by a post written about college placements on this forum. The end goal of this guide would be to land you a job at a product based company. The pre-requisites are that you should not hate coding and you need to know a programming language / at least have the determination to learn.

I will be constructing this guide as a whole for the 4 years that you will be in engineering. Feel free to skip some or add anything extra if you feel the need to. I've been writing drafts for this post since a week and have tried to organize my thoughts, but excuse any disorganization :)

This guide might help you if you check these boxes:

* A computer science student (preferably a newbie)
* Still in college (preferably in 1st year)
* Have a zeal to excel in the field and get relevant jobs.
* Have a blank resume with respect to your engineering degree.

**Stage 0 : Pre-work**

If you are very new to college, the odds are you are either severely depressed because of the achievements of people around you or you are overly enthusiastic for a new beginning or you are just unaffected by college. All of those are okay. If you are in the basket where you are scared of people boasting off about their achievement in the first year of college, don't worry! It doesn't matter what others do as long as you do what you can do and a lot of people who boast do not possess the expertise they think they posses. However, if you feel out of place, do DM me. We can have a chat.

In the pre-work phase, one has to understand their college and how things work in their college. This is best done in first year, before your first summer vacation. Most of the colleges have cells or clubs that have some sort of active projects. You need to talk to people, go through the college website and find out about these clubs. These clubs can be student-run or it can be run by a group of professors. You should be looking at the latter as they have well defined problem statements that they'd be working on and you've better chances of getting good exposure working on these projects.

Make a list of all the clubs that are there. Know about the procedure to get into each of these clubs, the projects they are offering / have previously done and who is the contact point. From these clubs, pick any of the interesting clubs/projects and set a goal to work towards developing skills that would help in those projects.

A personal recommendation would be to avoid highly specific clubs i.e. if a club is focusing on one problem statement that it is trying to solve since a few years it might not be the ideal place for a newbie to join. Smaller problem statements are good.

At the end of this stage, you must have a goal to be a part of one (or multiple) clubs during your first summer break.

**Stage 1 : Year 1**

In the first year, you will be under a common branch and your subjects will be science-related and not field-related. You might have 1 subject each semester that relates to your field, but I am not sure how much of help that would be as the teachers would be teaching the subject to non-CS people too. However, they will be introductory programming classes and its good to focus during these classes. If you don't find them helpful, read on.

We will divide the 12 months of first year into 3 quarters. 

1. Spend the first three months into learning at least one programming language. 
2. In your second three months, you should be able to read code and implement a few things. Then, pickup a programming language like C++ / Java. 
3. In your third quarter, you should look at trying to test your learning by implementing something useful. It can be small, it can be something that's already there, but do try to implement it from scratch by yourself.

Let me elaborate all three stages clearly.  


**Stage 1.1 : First Quarter, First Year - Learning a programming language**  
Python is an easy programming language to start off. You can also start off with C/C++/Java if you really want to skip a few steps, but I would ideally suggest you start off with Python. Learning resources like Hackerrank Language course, Automate The Boring Stuff e-book, some long Youtube tutorials and Learn Python The Hard Way ebook should be of help.  
Note : You should not aim to finish all 4 sources as that is not practically possible in three months. Follow a breadth first learning approach where you read a little and write a little. 

A good step to start off would be to aim to get 4 stars on Hackerrank's Python course to get a good grasp of the syntax. You should be familiar with indentation, for loops, if-else ladders, functions, lists, tuples, dictionaries and optionally, list comprehension. During your course, if you feel like something isn't clearly explained in Hackerrank, navigate to that section of Learn Python The Hard Way and refer it.

At this stage, you are comfortable with reading and writing Python, not explore Automate The Boring Stuff and try implementing some of the tasks given there. (I am looking at something that is onwards from chapter 8 of that book).

Alternatively, you can also watch and implement code from hour long Youtube tutorials that make promise to make you a hero from a zero in Python. But this looks like a hack that isn't rewarding because you are quite literally copy-typing the code that the Youtuber has written.

**Stage 1.2 : Second Quarter, First year - Implement & Learn OOP**

Many companies in the outside market look for Object Oriented Programming as a skill. After writing Python code, you are probably going to curse Java/C++ and will skip it completely because you won't believe how relevant these languages are in the market. This is one of the most common mistakes people do, but at the end they'd have to end up learning at least one of these languages. If you are taking up Java, I'd recommend [Derek Banas' Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7E8B7F4856C9B19) on youtube. You'd be coding what he's coding, but if you understand your code that is good enough. Learn about data structures in java (List, Set, etc) and learn about Iterators, Object Oriented Design Principles (Inheritance, Interface, Extension, etc). If you are looking for something smaller, [try this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial/). 

Similar courses exist for C++ also, so do your homework.

**Stage 1.3 : Third Quarter, First Year - Build something small**

So, now you know Python and to some extent Java. You've two paths from here. One is build something using Python/Java or second, learn HTML + CSS + JavaScript and build something with that. It can be something as small as a script receiving some data from an API and putting it in an excel sheet, or a calculator. The idea of this experiment is to check how fast you can build things. Once it is suitably built, you will have to write test cases. If you think it is too early to write test cases, list test cases on an Excel/Google Sheet and start testing your code for boundary cases.

For instance, if you have written a code that takes in a Reddit Thread as an input, gathers all the comments, checks the age of the accounts on all parent comments and returns some analytics (say, how many accounts are < 1 month old, less than 1 year old, etc) on it. You will need to handle test cases where your internet isn't working, the URL is wrong, you can't parse because your authentication token to Reddit API is wrong, the thread URL is wrong, etc. Basically, everything that you can think of.   


**FAQ**

> Should I get an internship in the first year?

Ideally, I wouldn't recommend an internship. Work with personal projects / college projects / skill development. Most of the internships given out to first year students are petty work that would be wasting time. Its much easier to put this in 2nd year when you will have a strong(er) resume.

> Should I specialize in one field?

No. Personally, a lot of students restrict themselves to learning only the buzzword fields, which is wrong. What is a buzzword today might have no relevance tomorrow. Focus on learning to learn, than learning one technology or one area. Initially, learn a little bit of a lot of things and slowly specialize into a field. That way, if your specialization does not click in the market, you always have a strong fundamental to pick something else up.

> Should I do problem solving?

Personally, I would say yes. But it is optional. I feel first year is too early to dive into algorithms and data structures even though a lot of colleges do teach basics of these. If you are really interested, you can definitely spend some time everyday in solving problems on Hackerrank / Leetcode / InterviewBit. But don't overdo it.

I've regularly seen Indian media sites like Zee News and others post warnings about impending earthquakes every few months. I believe this spread of pseudoscience must be limited as it leads to unnecessary panic in the minds  of  people who don't know how earthquakes occur.

Started in Karnataka, now affecting 10+ states.",30,d6ydpq,tonty4,1,"**TL:DR - Fall ArmyWorm is a deadly pest, which ravages through cereal and fruit farms. They are extremely difficult to control/manage as they do not get affected by commonly used/usable pesticides or conventional farming techniques. They spread like nothing we have *ever seen* and has the potential to put the Food Security of the world at risk**


1 **What is Fall ArmyWorm?** - [Wiki link here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_armyworm)

Below quote is from [The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations ](http://www.fao.org/fall-armyworm/en/)

>The Fall Armyworm (FAW), or Spodoptera frugiperda, is an insect that is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. In the absence of natural control or good management, it can cause significant damage to crops. It prefers maize, but can feed on more than 80 additional species of crops, including rice, sorghum, millet, sugarcane, vegetable crops and cotton. **FAW was first detected in Central and Western Africa in early 2016 and has quickly spread across virtually all of Sub-Saharan Africa. In July 2018 it was confirmed in India and Yemen**.

2 **DownToEarth.org has studied and covered the FAW effects in India** - [Article here](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/coverage/agriculture/fall-armyworm-attack-the-damage-done-63445)

(*DownToEarth is an fortnightly magazine, produced by an India based NGO Centre for Science and Environment*)

> * By the time the infestation was detected, it had already become malignant. Khemo Baghel, a farmer of Bade Chakwa village in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar district, took up maize cultivation for the first time early this year. He dug a borewell and was convinced that the return from maize would be better than any other crop. But hardly had the seeds sprouted, he saw some keedas (worms) slowly colonising his farm. “I detected them one morning. There was no trace of them the previous day. I think they landed at night,” he narrates. Within two months, the keedas had a firm grip on his farm, taking away 30 per cent of his maize crop. 

> * Now agriculture scientists and extension officers frequent Bade Chakwa and neighbouring villages and they too are puzzled. But by now, the outlier has a local name: “American keeda”.

> * In Palari village, the American keeda has damaged the entire maize crop. “I have been farming for four to five years, but have never noticed this insect. **Pesticides are not effective on them**,” says Parmeshwar Pandey.

> * In just nine months since FAW was spotted in India in Karnataka last June, it has invaded crops in over 10 states. As if taking a pre-scripted route, FAW infestation has spread from Karnataka to all southern states; then to western Maharashtra and Gujarat; and now to eastern states

> * Besides advancing fast, the pest is also attacking new crops. Though it is being detected mostly in maize crops—a preliminary calculation estimates it has affected nearly 170,000 hectares (ha) of maize crops—there have been reports from states where it has infested paddy, sugarcane and sweet corn. 

> * **Maize is the third most important cereal crop in India after rice and wheat. It accounts for 9 per cent of the total food grain production in the country.**


> * In Andhra Pradesh’s Institute of Frontier Technology — an affiliate of the Acharya NG Ranga Agricultural University (ANGRAU) in Tirupati — crop researchers are a worried lot as the news of infestation has turned from a trickle to a deluge. It was first identified in Andhra Pradesh in August 2018 when it affected maize growing areas of East and West Godavari districts, Srikakulam and Vizianagaram. **“With maize seed production being a major crop in Godavari district, it can have serious economic consequences. Being a major ingredient for the poultry and cattle feed, production losses in maize could cripple meat and milk production**,” says M John Sudheer, principal scientist at ANGRAU.

Science/Technology,Confused with my career,8,d26lgr,BeatMall,2,"Hi, I'm 23 year old man, living in India, I did my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science, I was fine in programming and was a noob in competitive programming, I somehow cracked the TCS CodeVita (a competitive programming competition) and got a job in TCS, but I'm not very much satisfied with my job. The college I studied in was tier three college so good companies don't visit our campus. I had offers from TCS, Wipro etc but TCS was the best in all the worst companies I had offers from so I joined it. The salary I get is also very low (3.5lpa), also I have a service agreement of an year there.

I'm very much confused about my future as to what I should do next, I don't want to work there. I need a good salary. So should I get better at competitive programming and let companies contact me or should I get decent in DS, Algos, give eLitmus and let companies contact me? Or should I give the GATE exam and do M.Tech or should i go to US and do my masters or should I give CAT and go for MBA.

I want some career advice but I have no friends in the relevant fields to ask. I graduated in electrical engineering and learnt absolutely nothing and have no skills to get me a job in electrical field. So I turned to IT and worked there for 1 year and god it was shit. I decided I will never get into IT and get into some product based companies. The issue is I have no education in CS. I quit last year and decided to give GATE-2019 in CS/IT paper to make my way into the computer science fields as I feel I am good at coding and stuff. I got AIR of 5300 in the GATE exam and am trying again for next year. (I'll continue with masters in whichever college I get if I don't get a good score this year too).

So now I'm completely clueless as for what my future plans are. Other than attempting GATE and doing masters. What am I supposed to do next? I feel like I don't have any practical skills to make myself employable. I can write programs in C and solve intermediate level coding problems on Hackerrank or similar coding sites. But I doubt that is enough to get me a job. I am thinking of learning some online courses and learn something other than C. But what should I learn? What do I have to learn to make myself employable? I understand that what I should start learning depends on which job I want to get into. But I can't decide and have no one to consult. I hear some buzzwords like data science and machine learning on the news and online but I don't know if that is right for me.

I thought of getting into the following fields: ML, Data science, Web development, Android development.

But again I have not the slightest idea of any of those. As far as I understand, ML and Data science requires more math and I can't say I'm good at math. With web development, I'm afraid it is not like traditional coding and wonder if it has good job opportunities here in India.

If you know any other good field with good opportunities in India please suggest.

Science/Technology,Need for a change of school culture and the hype around class 10th and 12th board exams,37,bn13id,sebthestudent,8,"I am currently a Ph.D. in Biology student at a university in the United States of America. I completed my class 10th in 2006, and my class 12th in 2008. I scored 78.3% and 72% in the aforementioned board exams, respectively. During my school years, I was never a meritorious student. I was rather among the bottom 40-50% of students from my class section academically. However, I worked really hard for my class 10th board exam and was deeply affected by the final percentage I scored. I did pretty well in the mock exams that I used to give at the private tuition center I took to help my academic performance and scored much more than many of friends majority of whom ended up scoring more than 85% in the final board examination.

&#x200B;

Till my class 10th, I studied at a prestigious public school in Delhi. As per the school's rule, a student could only be offered Science, if he/she scored more than 80% in English, Science, and Mathematics combined. My score was 77.7%, and therefore, was offered humanities and commerce. The rule didn't make sense as I scored 94% in Science, and my mathematics scores were always among the top 5-15% of the high scoring students in my section.  Therefore, I changed schools to study Science, and today I am earning a top-most degree in a field in which my school thought I was not a good fit.

&#x200B;

I suffered from depression and lack of confidence before my class 10th. I used to be good at cricket, but I suffered in that as well. My school carried a culture where if you are not good academically, then you are hopeless in other extra-curricular activities as well. I wanted to do academically well in school (prior to my class 10th), but the lack of confidence made it really difficult to come out of the shell and raise myself to glory (yes, being a good student did seem like a glory). I was so terrified that I would be scared to even open my textbooks.

&#x200B;

Not being able to get Science made things worse. I lost even more hope, and this worsened my mental health for my class 12th board exam. I remember praying to score at least more than 60% a night before the results. But, today if I could talk to my younger self, my recommendation would be to not lose hope and enjoy doing what you like. However, I still not sure if the environment that I lived would help. In my school days, I was compelled to feel like an outlaw for being among the bottom 40-50% of students from my class section.

&#x200B;

Recently, an article came out on Hindu, about a mother congratulating her son for scoring 60% in class 10th. She says that she had seen her son struggle to the point of giving up, and therefore, was proud of the final scores he got. In my time, my parents were also in full support of me. So was my father, who had always been strict. My father would never come to the parents-teachers meeting, as I was not up to the standards he expected of me. But, after my class 10th, he was very supportive and backed me at every point possible. Getting this sort of support from this person was huge for me then. He tried his level best to make a case to my school principal as to why I deserve to be a science student for the last two years of schooling. But, I remember walking down the school corridor with my parents trying to make a last attempt to convince my school principal, I met my Geography teacher. She congratulated me sarcastically and ridiculed me (in front of my parents) of how bad of a student I was before. It has been 13 years since that gesture, but the instance is still registered in my memory from word to word.

&#x200B;

Therefore, this makes me wonder, whether how much of a support system would your parents be if you have such teachers and cultures inculcated in schools. At that time, my parent's support didn't help me much. In fact, it made me feel even more horrible for being responsible for letting them go through such tough situations. Manier times. especially I like to believe in my case, low scores in class 10th are due to a stroke of sheer bad luck. But, the impact is grave for a naive 16-year-old.

&#x200B;

The point I am trying to make is that in addition to having a good support system from one's parents, the school's culture of dealing with young students needs to change. Teachers have a big responsibility of training future entrepreneurs, engineers, researchers etc, and therefore need to pay proper regard to a students self-esteem and self-confidence. What might just seem to be a simple comment (and here I don't include the personal issues that teacher might sometime have) the repercussions on the student's mental health might be huge.

&#x200B;

Ironically, I got to know about this below-given news article from the same geography teacher's Facebook post. She was cheering this wonderful mother for her attempt to lift the pressure off the head of her son' young mind. I first felt like commenting directly about the hypocrisy she has shown to me at the least. But, I think I should probably try to let this memory go of my head and move on.

Science/Technology,"2nd semester ending, No hopes for any internship [Need Guidance]",9,bioa3u,Kaori4Kousei,6,"It feels like I have wasted my 1 year,  2nd semester is ending and I don't have any internship. Now, my university is going to force me to take their summer training on web development which is the thing that I totally hate. My SGPA is 8.76 as I focused more studies and less on learning any specific technology. I have some projects but, only one big project in which I developed a program for the tech event that was hosted in our university. 

My area of interests are Data Science, Computer Vision, and Psychology. I tried to get into Data Science but, seniors said that learn Mathematics first. When I tried Computer vision, they said learn linear algebra first. So, I started learning linear algebra as well. So, now I am just banging head over books.  I don't know what to do, I am stuck. 

I don't want to waste my summer attending something that I am not interested in, please guide me.

Science/Technology,Advice needed for B-School.,10,ccqp9z,Ash_Sss,1,"I am doing a Bsc in Information Technology from a reputed college, placements are decent in our college, last year average was 4.5 lacs and highest was 18 lacs, this sounds pretty good for a college with very low fees but i don't see myself doing something in IT field, i cleared the entrances for VIT,KIIT,SRM,Manipal,COMEDK and few others but i did not join any of them for the very same reason, i was pushed into science by my parents and they were also forcing me to join KIIT(which i still can join) but i convinced them somehow for a Bsc as placements in KIIT were not as tempting as they had expected. I choose Bsc due to it's short duration, cost effectiveness and  curriculum was not much different from engineering if you don't include first year of engineering. 

&#x200B;

It's a relief for me that i only have to study 3 years in Bsc, now coming to the main question, at the end of three years, an MBA seems to me to be the most plausible way of getting out of this mess, my previous academics (10th,12th) are good and i can also score good my graduation.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Choose Bsc over Btech (don't like either of the two), want to do an mba.

&#x200B;

Now these are my questions :-

1) Does doing a Bsc instead of a Btech will have a negative impact during admission in B-Schools?

2) Are all these great packages that the top B-School pride themselves on are only for IITs/NITs graduates etc? 

3) What would you recommend for a person in a situation like this?

&#x200B;

If not top IIMs, i can surely get in top 10 schools.

&#x200B;

P.S - 1)My parents wanted me to do graduation only in CS,IT or Electronics, i have also cleared few entrances for BBA.

2) Money is not a problem, i'm open to all suggestions.

3) I want to go for a degree just after Bsc and don't want to work.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ccqp9z/advice_needed_for_bschool/
Science/Technology,Our Robots (Mitra) Vs Their Robots (Boston Dynamics),126,8z99fw,kash_if,95,"Let me preface this by saying that the intention of this post is neither to mock science/engineering/robotics in India, nor to pin the blame on the current government. I am just acknowledging the wide gap. 

Today I woke up to a tweet by IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad which showed a robot called Mitra made by an Indian company. The robot looked amusingly simple, like a bigger version of the toys I had as a child. See it here: 

> Nice to meet Mitra- the robot during Goa IT day that has been developed by an Indian startup. #DigitalIndia

> https://twitter.com/rsprasad/status/1018473949229826048?s=09

I was intrigued and searched for it. I came across this video which shows the same robot greeting Ivanka Trump when she visited India. The robot enters with drumbeats:

> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_irZMn5JeB0

The only function this robot could do was roll around with remote control and respond to a simple touch screen press. It kind of failed the second task because the maker did not think the process through (PM and Ivanka both press the button together and it got stuck on the next screen). This is the technology we were showcasing to the world.

On the other hand, we have Boston Dynamics. I remember seeing their Big Dog robot almost a decade back and it had blown my mind back then. See how it corrects itself even after being kicked:

They have many incredible robots. Here is their human shaped version:

It can walk on uneven surface, on snow, lift objects...the bastard can get up when knocked over. Their other robots can climb stairs, [open doors](https://youtu.be/fUyU3lKzoio?t=13s) (velociraptor from Jurassic Park?) and even run.

There are various categories in this kind of management. For example, technology, packaging, research (citizen science) or just awareness. What according to you does India need right now?

Science/Technology,Organisations like silverzone and SOF are ruining the prestige of olympiads in India.,185,8r87e7,thescoobynooby,53,"As most of you DO NOT know, there are 6 major olympiads organised for school students (there are 12 major science olympiads, but these 6 offer the most incentives).

These are->

1) International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO)

2) International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI)

3) International Physics Olympiad (IPhO)

4) International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO)

5) International Astronomy Olympiad (IAO)

6) International Olympiad of Linguistics (IOL)

All of these are extremely prestigious olympiads, which one can not take part in directly. They have various stages in which they sieve out children, and in the end a team of 4-6 children represents a country in these international olympiads. Olympiads organised by silverzone/SOF are misdirecting people into a false sense of prestige, and are making big bucks doing so. They sell admit cards, workbooks, text books, past year papers and whatnot. They even go as far as to copy the names of these olympiads exactly as they are.

Here's an incident: A friend of mine is an IMO bronze medallist, and he shared this fact one day with his relatives. His aunt was quick to respond that her daughter was in fact a gold medal holder in IMO. When he asked which year was the IMO, and where it was held, she told him that the olympiad took place in her daughter's school just a week ago. Here's the kicker, the real IMO has never taken place in India since its inception, and only 11 people in India have won a gold medal.

Just wanted to let out this quick rant. Dont waste your money on these hoax olympiads, and then go on and brag about how your child is a gold medal holder.

A few colleges in India offer admission on the basis of participation in these olympiads, and I was shocked when people from silverzone/SOF olympiads were lining up to claim their seats. Needless to say, they all got rejected, but what was even sadder is that they did not even know about the big 6 olympiads.

If you have been selected into the training camp of any of these 6 olympiads, you can get admission to Chennai Mathematical Institute(one of the best mathematics school in india) and IIIT-H(International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad). You are also selected for an interview at ISI(Indian Statistical Institute) if you have been a member of IMO-TC(training camp for IMO). These are some of the incentives to participate in these olympiads.

EDIT: correction, IMO was held in India once in 1996

EDIT2: India actually participates in almost all the major olympiads.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8r87e7/organisations_like_silverzone_and_sof_are_ruining/

**Childhood in my Hood, Spider-Man and INS DEGA**

As you can see, I am from Vizag. I was brought up and still live in the middle of an Industrial-Estate. My entire childhood revolved around [all sort of machines]( https://imgur.com/a/EdN3Xvj), machinery and welding sparks coming from the never ending fabrication works that went on in the hood. This sort of environment made me a naturally curious kid thanks to my dad and Uncle who both hold a Diploma in Mechanical Engineer for choosing the right neighbourhood. All my questions regarding these machines were nicely answered by my father and that in turn made me more interested in how things worked. This got a boost when I first met [*Spider-Man* and his amazing friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0FJNBRP8P0). This show and other Sider-Man shows had a huge impact on me, so much so that I used to play with common house spiders in hopes that its bite would turn me into a Spider-Man. Thanks to Universe, venomous spiders are not that common in a typical Urban Indian household I guess, I’m still alive and well. Besides that stupidity, Spider-Man being a student of science and using science to solve problems or for fighting villains made me interested in sciences and I started to pay attention in classes and made me question and think about things in universe and nature. This helped me have good foundation in Maths and General Sciences. 

On the other hand, our neighbourhood is in the close vicinity of a Naval Airport, INS DEGA. This helped me develop a love for things that fly. Our Neighbourhood used to be perfectly aligned with the runway path of the airport, this gave me really up close view of the planes touching down and taking off of the airport. Being a Defense airport there were special aircrafts in addition to the commercial ones. Navy Week was and still is the best season for some flight watching. At the age of 11, this interest in flying things pushed me to apply the science I learnt in school to make an object that fly with the help of DC motors it failed, of course. But that failure has set the path which I would follow in my higher studies. My father introduced me to A.P.J. Abdul Kalam who has been a huge inspiration. I may not know the name of the degree but I decided to study the science of flight and how to build things that fly. That was the idea of a child. 

**Finding an admission for Undergrad, IITM- Shaastra 07 & 08, Job Hunt & Masters in UK**

I was good theoretically but competitive exams are not my thing. I knew, I wouldn’t succeed neither in JEE nor AIEEE so any dreams of doing Aerospace/Aeronautical Engineering were smashed, my parents are kind enough to not force me into that machinery and left me to my choice for EAMCET. I just have to get a Mechanical Engineering seat in Andhra University or GITAM. That’s good enough for me because, Mechanical engineering also covers the science of flight and these two are the best engineering schools of my city and I don’t have to leave town if got an admit. 

So I found myself in GITAM, it has been a fun ride there. I always loved hands on jobs since I am a kid. I love to build something or do something with my hands. In second year of undergrad I attended Shaastra’ 07 at IIT MADRAS and it changed my outlook on engineering as a whole. I was awed by the students who built and gave a demo of the [VTOL flight built by them, Team YU-FLY?]( https://imgur.com/a/jj7DiUk) It was the coolest thing I saw. It was when I started taking an interest in research and technological developments in my field and in general. Target was set to Shaastra 08, me and my childhood friends made a contraption built by our own hands using a lot of Jugaad and tools found from the hood. Have a look here [GIF 1]( https://gfycat.com/KnobbyCompetentBear), [GIF 2]( https://gfycat.com/ImperturbableDefenselessIberianmidwifetoad). That was the demo video we sent in with the abstract. We are the Mighty mavericks but we got of Lots of weak links in the plan and it worked only partially. This set the stage for my participation in a series of technical events that I would attend over the last two years of my Undergrad. 

My communication skills were really bad by the end of Undergrad and this meant I wasn’t doing good in the Campus Interviews. I only wanted to join a core company and I couldn’t find any. I did the 5 day assessment for technical engineer post in IAF but didn’t make that list too. Couldn’t get a good rank in GATE. But found myself an admission at a really good Mechanical Engineering School in UK. Education Loan was the only way I could afford this and my parents had to put our house on the line to get a loan. EDWISE has given me immigration support free of cost as I secured my own admission. Went to UK and finished my degree, visited London twice and returned home. That’s it. I did not make much contact with the life in UK, its land and its culture. I was limited by time and money. But with the help of High-speed internet, I did learn a lot about world, science and technology, history and was introduced to reddit, student guilds, game of thrones and a whole lot of popular culture through university life. This helped with my English and subsequently my communication skills.

**Shock after returning home**

After finishing the degree, I returned home only to find that the degree I just received is not valid in India. Even a private engineering college didn’t want to hire me as a lecturer because my degree is not considered a Master’s Degree. That was a huge blow to me. I had to look for opportunities abroad again. Thanks to my thesis supervisor in UK, a well-known name in his field, gave me a good recommendation letter which helped me secure a full scholarship to do doctoral research in Australia. I was so happy and my parents were really proud of me.

**My way Down Under and How life changed there: RA Job, Research and Cooking**

I never thought I’d end up in Australia of all places. I went there with no expectations and the first few months have been the most difficult months. Then I made friends at student housing, who pushed me to apply for RA position and that changed a lot of things. I got the position and during my term I would be promoted to a senior RA and would organize the best parties and events over the next couple of years. This gave me a huge exposure to Aussie, International students and cultures from around the world. I had to be outgoing for the job so I became an outgoing person. [My love for cooking, adventure, camping and off road driving]( https://imgur.com/a/w6k2kIk) helped me go to some of the remote parts of Australia and make some amazing friends along the way. People around me at uni and housing were mostly younger than me, were not judgemental at all and I could do what I want without fear of judgement. I was earning good money while having the best time of my life and cleared my education loan in no time. [Perfect song to describe my time down under](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzpjvJdomfM) 

My research on the other hand was not going as expected. I am a hands-on person and I always enjoyed experimental work rather than simulations or numerical work. My research problem has been changed by supervisor from being heavily based on experiments to one that was half cooked right from the beginning which consisted mostly of Numerical work and only some namesake validation by experimental work. On top of that one of supervisor who is supposed to help me with Numerical work has moved to another university in another country all together and I was left with a supervisor who is Experimental guy guiding me on numerical work. From there it was a downward spiral and I ended up losing interest in the research I was doing. I produced two papers which in my opinion are not really great. 

On a parallel, I was doing really well as a RA, was cooking and trying some amazing recipes to whole lot of people from around the world and at one point [I cooked Indian food entirely made from scratch for the entire student village of 300 students](https://imgur.com/a/NqswIa9). Since I was a kid, I loved cooking and it was a life-long dream to own a restaurant someday and this idea was there in the back of my head all the time. And when it came to point where I can no longer continue my research work due to various reasons and I had to make a decision to change my line of work. It wasn’t easy, I had to consider so many things into account and had to find the confidence that I can cook commercially. 

**First Job in a Commercial Kitchen and How I found myself in a Road trip**

So I went searching for a job in a commercial Kitchen. After a lot of failed attempts, I went door to door along a popular coffee strip giving out [my new culinary resume](https://imgur.com/a/xVMIt9s) which I had to make up using the things I did so far. I got a call back from a Chef who loved my resume, my passion for the craft of cooking and gave me a job in his kitchen. Being the only computer literate among the staff I got to know the ropes of making stock lists, recipe cards, the numbers behind making a menu and running a commercial kitchen basically /r/kitchenconfidential. This gave me the confidence I needed. 

I rented a big motorcycle above 700CC which I always wanted to drive and just left for a drive. I covered 1400 KM in next two days along the southwest corner of Australia. This journey gave me the opportunity be with myself, think about myself and helped me come to a decision on so many things I wanted to do in life. The trip was really dangerous, I was driving 130-120 KMPH because I only rented the bike for two days and wanted to make the most out of it, I cannot lose sight of the road ahead because if I hit a kangaroo or things crossing the roads I’d crash at high speed and before I know it I’d be dead as Australia being so huge it would take hours for someone to notice me or get me to help. This fear for life made me so vigilant, self-aware and made me concentrate on the road like I never did before and that too hours on end. I was a different person at the end of this trip. I am not even exaggerating on this one. I felt like I conquered all my fears in life.

It was clear to me; I just had to do what makes me happy. I quit my research, quit the job in the kitchen and was finally on my way back home with the most daunting task ahead,  telling my parents about it, convincing them to help me start a Food Truck and to believe in my dream. After all is said and done, they still don’t get why I am doing this but decided to support my cause. 

**My Friend**

I could not do this alone; I needed a partner to do this with. The first person I got in mind was my lifelong friend. We went to same school since kindergarten and grew up together in the same neighbourhood and in a way we see thing uniquely in our own ways. He was not a brilliant student in class but he was the best when it comes to real world, he is creative, he can see things which no one else can in places nobody else even looks. He is brave and always helped me with my phobia for dogs; he has been a huge support in my life. I spoke to him regarding this and he immediately wanted to join me. He quit his job in Mumbai and came back to our city. He has his share of troubles at home, more than me and for that I really admire him for believing in my dream and to make this decision to join me on this journey.  

**Straight Outta Vizag**
	
I named our little venture Straight Outta Vizag because I truly believe this city has shaped my life so much, in a way it defines me and for that I love my city like how Peter Parker loves his city, New York. Although we are not the webbed vigilante we too try to do some good in our city. For our first socio-event, thanks to my sister and Good Universe, a NGO, [we organised an awareness campaign on women’s health in our neighbourhood](https://imgur.com/a/uKaRy2d) and it was a grand success. 

We started operations with this [Menu](https://imgur.com/a/WIlbGXU) and was getting a  good response. Then, Kerala floods happened so we decided to donate our earnings during this run towards the Kerala flood relief activities as you can see from our post history.

**Cold hands of the City governing bodies**

No matter how good our intentions are, we are not welcomed in the city. Before going on road, we went to various government offices like, Food safety and standards, Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation- GVMC and its Public Health wing, City Police and Fire Department to get permission according to this [Notification by Hyderabad City Police](http://www.ctp.gov.in/PressNote/NotificationFoodCourtVehiclePermission.pdf), I found online. It appears so that, none of the people I met have no idea if such a regulation existed in my City, Vizag. No one official has given us direction with this regard. No one has responded to us properly, most of the people claim that no one has come to them like us, asking permission to put up a food truck and that they won’t allow it, mostly because they haven’t done that before. But there are lot of food trucks running in the city. 

[I submitted a letter to the Commissioner, GVMC]( https://imgur.com/a/F0jGspG) in May but got no response even after all these months so we started operations with only a FSSAI license in hand. Where ever we go Police or the GVMC personnel has asked us to remove the truck. Why are other trucks allowed then? Later I learned that other food truck people formed into Unions area-wise and are running things according to their made up rules within the area like a “dhandha”. Why do I have to join a union of a particular place or all the places if I intend to set-up my truck?

**More Social Activism**

During the month of August 2018, we had rains for a couple of days and our street got flooded due to improper storm drains. We have had this issue for ages and our colony people have approached the municipality but nothing was done. In lieu of this, we brought it to the notice of [GVMC commissioner through an open letter](https://imgur.com/a/F0jGspG) on our facebook and twitter profiles, which talks not just about our problems in the hood but also other problems that I have seen in my city. This time we got a response but I did not mention my problems with the permits because it didn’t seem right to plug the same with problems in the hood and my city. 

GVMC responded promptly and started the restoration of storm drain works in September and finished the work during the second week of November. Due to these works happening we had to put a comma to our operations and resumed our work during third week of November. 

**What happened after we are back on road…**

This time we wanted to try a healthy breakfast menu and we set up shop on the way between VUDA Park and YSR statue Roundabout on the beach road. We were asked to vacate the place by an Assistant City Planning officer from GVMC Zone II. The next day we moved to parking in front of YMCA on beach road and two days later, this time, a sanitation inspector warns us not to put up the truck and it will be seized if we do so again. So we removed the truck and went to meet the GVMC Zone-II commissioner, Mr. Palli Nallanayya. Here’s how our interaction went by: 

Me n My friend walk into commissioner’s room who appeared to be in a staff meeting. 

Me – ‘trying to hand him the letter we already submitted to GVMC’-- utters the words: “Sir, memu food truck okati start chesam mee...” “Sir, we are starting a food truck…”
He cut me off there and with a growing frown on his face he just utters the word “ivvamu”... “Alantivi ivvamu ma zone Lo” “Stop it there, we will not give you a permit. We don’t do this sort of thing in our Zone.”

Looking at his body language and the way he didn’t even bother to hear what we have to say made me sick and we left the room. 

Because of these obstacles we are now without a proper location for our truck. Many have suggested me ways to get a contact in GVMC who knows “how to get things done” But I do not want to go that route because it is not the right way to do it and as stupid as I am I will fight for what is right and we are planning to meet the commissioner regarding this and File a RTI with GVMC and City Police regarding what they know about already existing food trucks. Meanwhile, we found some gigs with adventure agencies and started arranging food for trekking and camping events in our beautiful and untapped eastern ghats.  We also cater to small parties, family gatherings, speciality events, college get-togethers and many more. We met some amazing people along the way, particularly youngsters who seem to respect and admire what we are trying to do which in turn gave us energy to continue on our journey. We intend to bring cooking and the joy of making food closer to our patrons and give them a well-rounded dining experience wherever they choose to eat.  

Our city has so much to offer in terms of tourism. Our tourism potential is not fully tapped into and we want to promote our city tourism which will help create jobs in the local communities. I cordially invite any and all off you folks that love a good beach or a view from a hill, come visit our city, Vizag. If you choose to hire us we can take you around and accompany you with good food and present you with some amazing views that are unique to our city and it’s geography. As the songs goes...

I’m sharing this with the reddit community because it is a unique platform compared to other social networking sites and the people, stories from reddit have inspired me a lot and helped me develop as person. And by sharing this I would like inform the community about us and hope that our story may inspire someone else in realizing their own dreams. Also, to reach out to a lot of people who barely know about our City in terms of a travel destination and to reach out artists, content creators, travel bloggers and to collaborate with anyone who is interested in enjoying good food and nature. Do have a look at us, know about us and if possible inform your friends about us. See you on the road.

It's truly mind-blowing what OP has suggested.

Basically, this model has been there since 19th century and it was used to discipline kids and make them obedience.There has been no change ever since.Even though literacy rates of the west are higher,the quality of education has made many students drop out because it doesn't promote any creativity or critical thinking.The side effects of this are depression,ADHD and living unproductive life,of course.

What do you think of the solution they suggested?Do you want to add something to solution?

But... how?",2,at9hy3,nibirujiii,4,"Next to Aadhaar, Facebook may be the greatest modern threat against privacy. How do we fight back and keep Facebook from colonising India?

> ""The business model of the internet is surveillance. We build systems that spy on people in exchange for services. [Corporations call it marketing.](https://www.schneier.com/news/archives/2014/04/surveillance_is_the.html)""

Have you noticed? Whenever someone says ""you're being **too political**"", it usually means ""you've mentioned a group of people I don't care about"".

Or **they gaslight you** -- saying you're ""crazy"" for not being white, male, straight, or ""American"" enough. If you dare to notice the discrimination built into their systems, they try to distract from the issue by **attacking you as a person**, trying to force you to jump through endless hoops of arbitrarily defined ""moral purity"".

**This is the typical response on Reddit.** Silicon Valley's social media (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit) was built by them, for them. ""Them"" means entitled middle-class white males. More specifically: _middle-class, white, aged between 18 and 49, male, cisgender, heterosexual, and mostly American_ males. They built social media for themselves and their friends. The rest of us are unwelcome guests in their safe space.

# **Free Speech versus Diversity?**

This is why the rest of us (non-white, women, LGBT, and others) are treated so badly on their systems. They refuse to ban racist, or violent misogyny and homophobia because it would hurt ""free speech"". Their persecution anxiety leads their bigotry behind slogans like ""diversity is the problem"", ""don't shove _your diversity_ in my face"". George Orwell would be proud (or horrified) to see such twisting of words in service of harmfully bad ideas.

> Here's an analogy: nuclear power can be used to power entire cities and give millions of people energy for centuries, or destroy cities and commit genocide in the blink of an eye. Should we allow the secrets and materials for nuclear to proliferate everywhere, because it's ""just science"" and ""knowledge wants to be free""? Of course not.
> 
> Should we allow bigotry and hatred to rule on social media because it's ""just speech"" and ""information wants to be free""? Of course not.

Now you see the bigotry hidden in Silicon Valley talk about ""free speech"". It's free for them, and the costs are left for us to bear. This is the same as patterns of colonisation throughout the history of Western civilisation. History has begun to repeat itself on the internet.

In other words, they have no grasp of basic morality for anyone who isn't like them. And as you'll see here, that means people in India, Brasil and around the world are now starting to die.

## **Aadhaar's Failure is Facebook's Success**

The question here begins with privacy.

Aadhaar is well-known for allowing unauthorised access to [private information of millions of India's citizens](https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/aadhaar-breach-everything-you-need-to-know/story-VhCKHDIL8lziw6OcnhL4wO.html). People are concerned, are rightfully so.

In the case of Facebook, selling your privacy to the highest bidder is the entire profit model. That's why Facebook is ""free"". It's as if Aadhaar's privacy-destroying mistakes are Facebook's business plan.

For India, a country where [69% of citizens live in rural areas](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.RUR.TOTL.ZS), this means that over 300 million people (those who have smartphones) are at risk. And unlike the Indian government's dependence on the will of the people, Facebook is completely unaccountable to anyone but their company shareholders.

# **Facebook's Plan to Colonise India**

Starting in 2014, [Facebook tried to give away free Internet to rural India](https://www.cnet.com/news/why-india-doesnt-want-free-basics). The bargain was simple: if you use internet through Facebook, we give it to you for free. That really means, ""if you allow us to watch, record and sell data about every move you make online, we'll give you access to a limited amount of internet for no cost.""

Thankfully, India's regulators eventually said no, and in 2016, the Free Basics program was stopped.

## **Facebook and Bollywood**

If you've watched any Bollywood films over the past few years, there are two names you'll see and hear all the time. You can probably guess. No, it's not SRK or Deepika Padukone. Also not Salman Khan or Katrina Kaif.

The two names are Facebook and WhatsApp.

Again in rural India, WhatsApp has been involved in [an increasing number of murders](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/listeningpost/2017/12/deadly-rumours-india-whatsapp-dilemma-171216091928319.html). The culprit is rumours and intentional misinformation that spread via Facebook's messaging service (WhatsApp).

Even though Facebook's attempts to colonise India are blatant (the Free Basics program) and have led to several deaths (WhatsApp), they are still making more efforts.

Instead of regulators, they are trying to convince citizens that Facebook is good by having celebrities constantly use the service in Bollywood films.

You may not have known this, but Instagram and WhatsApp are owned by Facebook. Now think of how many times you've seen films where the real stars in the background are social media accounts on someone's smartphone. (There's even a Reddit community [specifically for Indian people praising Facebook...!](https://np.reddit.com/r/indianpeoplefacebook/))

# **Democracy, Immigration, Misinformation and Disinformation**

Now think about how easily democracy has been subverted in places like the United States, Britain and Brasil. In the U.S., the Trump campaign openly acknowledged targeting [millions of young women and black voters through Facebook](http://fortune.com/2016/10/30/trump-voter-supression-operations/) to suppress their votes, since they tend to vote Democrat (not Republican; Trump is a Republican). In the case of Brexit, [hundreds of fake Twitter accounts also spread disinformation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/14/how-400-russia-run-fake-accounts-posted-bogus-brexit-tweets).

As more children and adults in mass detainment centres, the American immigration service (ICE) is [using users' private Facebook data to target and hunt down immigrants](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/ice-facebook-data-track-immigrants).

# **To prevent colonisation of our digital lives, we must fight back for our right to privacy.**

So how can we fight against amoral companies like Facebook (with WhatsApp and Instagram) and Twitter?

We now know that [""free"" access via Internet advertising is just another word for intrusive surveillance](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/24/deep-surveillance-is-price-of-a-free-web-advertising). We know that in rural India, where many are less educated, people are dying because of misinformation spread through social media. And we know since 2016, that as long as Facebook and Silicon Valley can get away with it, they don't care.

There needs to be an alternative, and it needs to come from the people who are most affected. Not another Facebook, Orkut, Reddit or Twitter, created by white men, for white men -- and if anyone else wants to join, they'd better not be too ""political"". The web is run by narcissists and bullies now, and there has to be a better way.

I'm working with a project that is creating a new social network, but if this post inspires you to start something for India and the rest of the world, I'd be glad to work with you, too. And if you're just hearing some of these facts for the first time, it's okay to be angry. Get angry enough to do something right now. The stakes are too high now to just shrug, turn away and take another selfie: if we let Silicon Valley take our privacy away, they will never give it back.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/at9hy3/digital_colonisation_the_fight_for_indias_soul/
Science/Technology,I hate summers!,11,9c4cu9,throw_me_in_a_fridge,21,"Disclaimer: My previous post was removed, reason looked more like an excuse and my appeal wasn't answered. Here I'm posting it again. It's about climate i promise, nations are included as relevance and examples for my arguments, not for personal attacks.
My previous [post is archived here.] (https://www.scribd.com/document/387542089/Enjoying-summers-Me-too-s)

I'm from Northern part of India, this little state once upon a time called as breadbasket of India, you guessed it, Punjab.  It might have lost its charm over the years but it's still one of the best place to live in India except one thing: The weather.  

I loathe the weather here, leave aside the first 4 weeks, it's literally a swamp for rest of the year, unbearably hot and humid. As a kid who grew up in Amritsar, I remember when i used to play in the fields outside my house in the monsoons, The fields are covered in concrete now. 

Fast-forward to today, I'm now an adult aged 19. My body has gained mass and stature of a man but what it hasn't gained is Mr. Freeze's Freeze-Ray to keep my cerebral cortex cool. Unless you stay inside an air-conditioned environment or wear some alien OptiTemp suit, you can't stop the heat from bogging down your cognitive functions. It's a fact!

Peak of human Intelligence seldom can be achieved in hot humid climates hence the IQ disparity between the inhabitants of temperate and tropical regions. 

Almost all developed nations are in the temperate zone barring Russia and North Korea (due to decades of Communist mismanagement). Tropical regions are mostly poor except for Bangalore-sized tiny nations like Abu Dhabi (Oil), Singapore (strategic sea hub location) etc.

If you compare within countries in the temperate zone, there's an intellectual divide between their northern and southern regions. Take Italy for example, Southern Italy is comparatively more corrupt and poor than Northern Italy. As such there's a clear correlation between climate and intelligence. This holds true for USA and Japan too. These are wealthy nations who can afford to run AC 24x7.

According to the Cold Winter theory by Richard Lynn,  Ancestors of Europeans and North-East Asians faced extreme winters thus higher intelligence would've evolved and those who didn't develop intellect, perished. Going by this, Eskimos should have the highest IQ on Earth which isn't the case but wait, the author has something to say about it.

    ""Lynn  (CWT, p. 144)  argued that high intelligence can  only  
    evolve in  large populations because mutations, being chance 
    events, are more  likely to occur in large populations. Arctic
    people have smaller  populations than Asians or Europeans and
    therefore mutations beneficial to intelligence did not occur.""

Well, intelligence is a complex topic and it is influenced by host of factors like genetics, culture, birth environment etc. Cold weather is beneficial for brain and yields the easiest intelligence boost without winning a genetic lottery. 

The energy required for cooling human body is greater than warming it up. Also, the brain guzzle up to 20% of total energy, since glucose is also used to regulate temperature of the brain in hot weather, less is spared for the process of cognition.

The people who ruled India for almost 200 years, the mighty British have been living on an Island where yearly day temperature is half that of India, 15C vs 31C. UV Radiation is also quite low and so is the scorching sunlight hours. Contrary to popular belief, dark winters don't cause depression. 

[For science]
Okay, these smartypants from the north aren't heatproof. Consider this scenario. If we were to put some of them on an isolated place without education, knowledge and access to any human technology in existence. Only children can be perfect subjects, So thousands of 5 to 12 years old on a big island (or a continent perhaps) in middle of the equator. They'll  explicit the same behavioral tendency of any equatorial human in the first generation itself, angry, lazy and unproductive. They'll procreate, form languages and religions, adapt to hot humid weather, they'll be too busy killing bugs and sheltering from heat, no energy for intellectual reasoning. 500-2000 years have gone by, their IQ has plummeted to new depths. It's now more comparable to Congolese. Several millennia has passed, their skin now exhibits more melanin than ever to protect them from sun. Suddenly one day, A big ship landed on their shore.

""Terra nullius? ^spots ^a ^man  Hello primitive folks! Wassup? Oh god it's so hot in here! Ah! Sunscreen in a jar of honey, you slaves gonna make me money!""
[/don't flame me]

Enough, The rich northern countries are one who are more worried about the climate change, maybe they might invent some artificial clouds or climate alternation tech once it start becoming unbearable there. The way things are moving now, inhabitability of Indo-gangetic plains in my lifetime is evident.

Science/Technology,Short concise interactive books for college students. Indian education system in bad shape.,4,9xldhp,udit003,9,"I am a computer science college student from India. I found that students always complain about the education system, the poor quality of teachers and teaching methods (and I am one among them, it's awful in India at least) . At the same time some teachers also complain that students don't do any self study at all. They are always looking for shortcuts, like reading an article or some videos here and there to pass the exams .

If we think from the student point of view, it's very difficult for them to read books and get in-depth knowledge for so many subjects every semester at the same time following your passion (which is most of the time , unrelated to the courses they are taking) and taking part in extra curricular activities at college, learning cool technologies to become job ready. Hence it's actually not possible for them to sit down and read through 500 pages books for each subject, do assignments honestly .

I have an idea to solve this problem. If we can develop short (around 100 pages) books for every subject , which are interesting to read and at the same time give students a overall view of the subject to pass the exam. This will help them get a complete picture rather than the fragmented knowledge they get from internet , which is mostly pointless. Through a collaborative platform online , we can get this book developed by the best people in the community and make it available for everyone to read for free.

This is my idea in very brief, I would love to know your opinions and indulge in further discussion if anyone is interested.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9xldhp/short_concise_interactive_books_for_college/

Science/Technology,IT-to-Neuroscience?,5,b4fjxb,sud8233,0,"Hi, 

Currently I am pursuing PhD in information technology. However, my work is progressing toward neuroscience (which I found as my energy converging point). Currently, I am studying emotions. Due to IT background, I am pretty well with the coding skills and applying it for customised high end GPU based calculations on voxel wise activity given some task. Although, I always have this feeling of lack of sufficient knowledge in the field of neuroscience. Although, I am trying my best to learn as much as possible but missing a disciplinary thinking while facing a complex puzzle. Although, I find myself studying about the neuroscience stuff without any sense of exhaustion, a leap step is needed to get deeply indulged in this exciting and important domain.

As it is a transition period for me where I need to use my relatively more developed computational skills to get the sense and pleasure of getting new in-depth knowledge of the field of brain science. I am seeking for the suitable guideline which can give me a better chance to grab the domain knowledge during this transition and lead me towards disciplinary thinking over more complex problems. I am interested in further studying emotions and related disorders. The guidelines during the PhD and after the PhD both are very much needed and highly appreciated.

Science/Technology,We really need to talk about Flairs.,106,6bacbg,root_su,133,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/
Science/Technology,"I need some help, and maybe some guidance[Self]",9,a0bxtr,jopiz,4,"I'm an engineering student and am currently enrolled into an engineering college. The thing is that from the beginning of my college life, I have been depressed. All around me people have been constantly talking about job. I don't want to pursue engineering. I feel trapped and depressed. I spend time sleeping or browsing Internet to distract my mind. Instead of having a goal in my life, I'm always thinking of dying; I'm always thinking of running away. I wanted to study math(and sciences), but due to people telling me to go for the college instead of course(and also because of me not knowing the difference between science and technology), I landed up where I am. And the thing is that now I can't do anything. I'm 23 and living off my parent's money. I don't want to disappoint them. My ability to think rationally has diminished. Now I cannot concentrate for more than a few moments before getting anxious. I think I am depressed but I don't know. I want to die but I cannot. I hate myself to be born. I don't want money or job or anything. I want peace. There is nobody to help me. All people around me think I am an idiot for not thinking rationally. They all want job and money. I want to rest. Either way I'm gonna die, even if I get a job and earn money or not. Should I  run away from the college when the break starts so that nobody knows? I wish I die tonight in my sleep. For anyone getting this far, thanks for reading (I needed to open up and though that few strangers on the internet wouldn't mind me sharing something) and enjoy your life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a0bxtr/i_need_some_help_and_maybe_some_guidanceself/

Science/Technology,Pride and Prejudice,93,6s6xir,airwolf1989,76,"I was having a beer while reading a book in the cafeteria in Deutsches Museum. A middle aged couple sat next to me. The lady said, ""Hello"".
""Hello"", I replied. The gentleman joined in, ""Studying in Munich?""
""No. Working"", I said. 
""Where you are from?""
""India"", I said. 
""Oh we are also originally from India. We live in USA. 20 years. Came here to visit our daughter and our grandchildren. We are originally from this city of that state in India"". I smiled and nodded and started speaking to them about that city in that state in India because I also lived there for 7 years. He started saying how much he misses his city and his country, being 20 long years in USA. I smiled and listened although I wanted to return to my book. Here I was sitting surrounded by the statues of Planck, Heisenberg, Einstein, Leibnitz and hundreds of scientists and mathematicians, the descriptions and depictions of their work in one of the best technical museums of the world containing hundreds of machines of the past, computers, ships, aircrafts, telescopes and what not and suddenly the gentleman said, ""No matter what one says, we are far ahead than them"". I was puzzled. ""What are we talking about?""

The man said, ""In shastra it is written - Everything comes from water and fire. Have you read Veda?"" and then he unfurled a shloka from Veda. I was quite amused. He then continued, ""Our Munis and Rishis have written everything about nuclear physics 5000 years back"". I interjected, ""That I would not know but I think that the contributions of the likes of Ramanujan, Bose, Raman and Chandrasekhar were enormous"". He skirted those names and said, ""I am an engineer. I have to tell you that India is at least 1000 years ahead than any country in science. One has to read Veda"" and then he fired another sloka. His wife was not getting impressed just as I was not making much sense of the sudden outpouring of Sanatan sentiments. 

I realised that it was better to move. But then he did not stop, ""You see it is a matter of what I call perspective. We knew thousands of years back what scientists here are knowing now. Chemistry, atomic physics, space everything we knew. At that time Europe was what? A dark continent. They knew nothing. We invented Zero, you know that?"" 

This is when I lost it. I asked him, ""Sir, you miss your city and your food and friends. That is quite understandable. But I do not understand why you have spent 20 years in USA and your daughter is married in Munich while you miss your country so much and you cannot stop praising it. Why don't you go and live in India? I also do not understand why you are even here when you should be in India digging Vedic spacecrafts. Why do you come to a Science and Technology museum in Germany to claim superiority on others' achievements? Indeed one can take the Indian out of India but one cannot take the India out of the Indian.""

His wife tugged at his arm before things escalated because I guess he was about to throw another salvo of slokas. They got up and left. I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth. It is not the ignorance that hurts so much, it is the misplaced pride that left me dumbfound and sick in my guts. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6s6xir/pride_and_prejudice/

Science/Technology,I am planning a new digital learning initiative. I need your help.,22,8rsrvc,plannercdali,12,"I have just finished my school education in science in India, and am deeply concerned about the state of affairs. I wish to target specific areas.

Some complain that the system promotes ‘rote memorization’ and that the syllabus is ‘too theoretical’ and is not ‘practical’ or ‘linked with everyday life’.

The system is far worse than that.

In classes 1 to 10:

There is a heavy emphasis on regurgitation of memorised material.

There is too much ‘flab’ in the syllabus.

There is very less rigour in the subjects of maths and science.

The school textbooks are by no means enough to gain a comprehensive picture of a subject, but the line of questioning is such that you don’t need anything more than the textbooks.

There is not much focus given on seeing if students are capable of analysing new information and making pertinent observations.

Further questioning from the students’ side has no real outlet within the traditional syllabus.

In classes 11 and 12:

The rate at which information is to be consumed and understood increases dramatically.

The school textbooks are by no means enough to completely understand a subject BUT understanding is necessary to be able to survive the examinations.

Rote memorisation is an impediment, not an aid to success.

The line of questioning is far from direct. You need stop treating the syllabus as a body to remember, but as a set of tools in your arsenal to fix the problem. You have to generate independent results from the tools you are given.

Every piece of information in the syllabus is important and useful for examinations. There is nothing that you can’t know.

In the world of competitive exams:

You need to go well beyond the given syllabus.

You need to be able to think very creatively and come up with innovative solutions.

Emphasis is given on the ability to manipulate learnt content within extreme time constraints to solve the situation.

You can see the problem, can’t you? For the first 10 years of formal education, when they are in their most neurologically adaptive state, we expect students to have this conformist, regurgitative attitude towards academics, and then, when they are nearly adults, we expect them to have the analytical and creative problem-solving abilities of mini-Einsteins.

There are three categories of students who survive this catastrophe.

The real prodigies. These students quickly learn to move ahead of the existing syllabus and go onward. I respect and admire them.

Those whose circumstances give them a head start. This was me. I hated rote memorisation so I would do the bare minimum necessary. I’m not saying that I performed bad, academically, in classes 1 to 10. It’s just that where the others were busy memorising whole passages verbatim, I was looking at a few key words and facts and building up the rest in the exam hall. That’s the only way I kept a facade up despite a lousy work ethic. Since I was already accustomed to never memorising, it was mainly a matter of adjusting to the new rate and new depth.

Those who can work really, really hard. I admire the sheer determination of this category, and they often overlap with 1. and 2. , but many of them continue with the verbatim approach and clear the struggle by memorising every case and every type of problem possible.

We need to fix this. We need to expose students to a problem-solving based curriculum from day one. We also need to make the syllabus far less top-heavy. With just one or two more chapters in each subject every year, we could have the whole of class 1 to 10 over a couple of years earlier.

In the traditional system, I would have said that this is impossible. It needs a curriculum change, reskilling of teachers, change of public policy, bulldozing public opinion that school is becoming ‘harder’, and forcing experimental teaching and evaluation methods on schoolchildren.

In the digital world, creating an adaptive learning system for such a goal is a far less difficult challenge.

In my ‘ideal-scenario’ curriculum, I would focus on only four skills:

Critical reading: In the current scenario, learning the ‘chapters’ is given more emphasis than on checking if students can actually process new passages of information. Most students are unable to self-learn and are dependent on spoonfeeding for this reason.

Critical writing and grammar: I don’t mean the typical ‘parts-of-speech-in-detail’ grammar. I just mean being able to differentiate between correct and incorrect English grammar and being able to apply it to express new ideas. Once students can do this, they no longer have to memorise passages to answer in exams — they can construct their own sentences.

Arithmetic and geometry: Pretty self explanatory.

Logical reasoning: This is not subject-specific. It should be done in a way which is independent of any particular technical subject. In the JEE, the content is based on PCM, but they actually test us on our critical thinking and logical reasoning ability — using the subject as a medium. We don’t have to use any prerequisite subject.

I need the help of subject curriculum and testing experts, web designers, teachers, students, and anybody else who feels that they can contribute to this project.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you saw my above post, then you know what this is about.

I really, really need help from experts in both education (in both STEM and liberal arts) and technology implementation (primarily web design, UX/UI etc.)

Otherwise, I guess it is up to only me to revise 12 years of syllabus for a broken system, rewrite and execute lecture videos, come up with suitable assessments, code the adaptive assessment system, build the website, and deploy it.

All of that, assuming I already know how to do it, would take at least a year for one person to execute -- that's assuming they are working full time.

Which I can't.

And that's if I knew how to do everything by myself.

Which I don't.

What this means is that without help, this project in it's current form will be over before it even got started.

Even if you can't join the core dev team, it would be a huge step forward if you could direct me somehow to find the support I need for this project.

Thanks,

Science/Technology,"Yesterday hundreds of 'protestors' attacked army and police units in Pulwama, Kashmir during an encounter with militants enabling three militants to escape.",219,45v01x,notsocourageous,389,"While most newspapers and TV channels reported that two civilians were killed in police firing in Pulwama, what they didn't report was that this was because hundreds of protestors from nearby villages attacked the security forces engaged in an encounter with LeT militants.The heavy stone pelting led to injuries to six army and fifteen police personnel.It also helped 2-3 militants to escape with another one was shot dead while he was trying to run away.
While police firing led to death of one protestor there are conflicting reports on whether the woman killed was part of protesters or was she looking at the events from her verandah and was hit by a stray bullet.

>The people were protesting against killing of a militant in an encounter with police and army.
Officials said that police and army cordoned the Kharpora area of Kakapora this afternoon. “Some militants who were walking in a street fired towards the forces which were retaliated, triggering an encounter,” officials said.
“The encounter continued for two hours in which one militant was killed. However three others managed to escape from the spot,” they said.
The killed militant was identified as Adil Ahmad of Banderpora, Pulwama.
“As the encounter was on, hundreds of people from neighbouring villages staged massive protests and pelted stones on the forces in order to help the militants break the cordon,” officials said. The forces fired tear smoke shells and bullets on the protesters, killing a local boy on the spot. He was identified as Danish Farooq Mir son of Farooq Ahmad, resident of RatniporaPulwama. Danish was a student of B Tech in Islamic University of Science and Technology.

Science/Technology,This is how falsehoods spread: Smriti Irani on how Fields Medalist Manjul Bhargava teaches math,143,5sygz4,lallulal,103,"Manjul Bhargava is a famous Fields Medalist of Indian origin who teaches at Princeton. His nationality is Canada/US. He was born and brought up there but also visited India on holidays.

Like many other mathematicians he has compared poetry and music to mathematics. He has studied Sanskrit poetry at college level. Here is a quote from him

> ""As a child, I enjoyed studying Sanskrit, Sanskrit poetry and Indian classical music. I saw maths in all these things; that further inspired me to pursue mathematics. When I went to college, I took Sanskrit, a lot of music, computer science and physics, and also mathematics. To me, mathematics was the common thread in all these subjects""

As a lover of Sanskrit language, I know the distance between the statements “Panini’s grammar precedes any formal grammar by two millennia” and “Sanskrit is compulsory to get a job at NASA”. Then there is a rainbow of truths and falsehoods between them.

Here is an excerpt where our Education Minister (then) explains how Bhargava teaches math at princeton (at 1m30s):  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GGkIiZou5I&t=1m30s

> In Princeton, in his class — which is the most famous — is “Mathematics for Non-Mathematicians”. I have had the privilege of having talks with Manjul on many occasions and I know him well. And I asked him — what excites you most about teaching that class. **He said, I teach that class in Sanskrit and poetry from India**, and poetry that my mother got from her house in Jaipur. Now imagine Manjul trying to do the same in India …

Aside: the victimhood continues. She can’t imagine a math/cs professor talking about Panini when teaching BNF etc in an IIT. Imagine!

But more importantly, she is outrightly spreading falsehoods about Bhargava. I have followed his work and also his media appearances for some time. He is very mindful of what he speaks. He can never say something as stupid as “I teach my math class in Sanskrit”.

What does this mean? Is Irani actually that stupid that she can’t understand what Bhargava is saying to her? Or like always, she is again spreading falsehoods?

Science/Technology,Rant: Are we condemned to being ignorant?,234,4uz3ms,randompersonthrowawa,121,"I've been wanting to write this for a *long* time but somehow haven't been able to make time to sit and pen it down. This will be long, so please bear with me. 


Many months back, I came across this [interview](http://www.rediff.com/news/interview/aatish-taseer-india-is-semi-literate-and-chetan-bhagat-is-the-best-it-can-do/20150205.htm) with Aatish Taseer, where he calls India a ""semi-literate"" country. I was quite baffled then, by his words. Why would someone with such deep connections to India make such a disparaging comment on its citizens? Its true significance has finally hit me and it's making me sad.

We're a country of a billion people with few opportunities and deep contrasts. However instead of trying to bridge the divide, mend the fracture and soothe the pain, we keep insisting on magnifying the gap and adding salt to the wounds. 

How did we become so politically incorrect as a nation? How did we let bigotry define us to such a large extent? How did we let education fail us?

As Indians, our single goal as kids has been reduced to clearing entrance exams without realising the kind of studies that we're getting involved in, to get there. We're not broadening our minds to ideas, we're not enhancing our understanding of ourselves, we're not experimenting with out of the box ideas on science and technology. No. As 15-16 year old kids, we're solving questions. Recognising patterns. Trying to understand the examiner's psyche in order to get the most questions correct, sometimes spending months and even years in those hallowed halls they call coaching institutes. If you manage to set aside all the hoopla around coaching institutions, they're merely *cram schools*. Even our neighbouring China has them. But we as kids, and more importantly our parents, don't want to be told of that. Because deep down, that term *cram school* conflicts with our idea of what education should be all about. I, like many millions, was also a victim of this. Yes, I made it though. But I'm under no illusion about exactly what I've achieved. I've crammed and smarted my way through entrance exams by recognising patterns and understanding ""important concepts"" without ever learning to think for myself.

And then the results are in front of us to see. This [video](https://youtu.be/Rfw5nQy5_pw) popped up on the front page of my YouTube yesterday and I ended up watching it. One of the kids here appears to be incredibly cocky about what he thinks of people who weren't able to qualify for IIT. I don't blame the guy, maybe a few years back I'd have behaved the same way. But he exposes how limited our understanding is, of education. Our entrance exams, be it medical or engineering, are tough *because* we have such a huge population. That and because the number of institutions of repute (even though the IITs don't even rank among the very best institutes in the world) in this country is embarrassingly minuscule. 

College education is a similar tragedy. Teachers merely teach. Students merely attend classes. Teachers get promoted after a few years, students graduate every year. The teachers have no incentive to teach, they don't get promoted because of the performance of their students, they don't get recognition for using exemplary methods of teaching. And yet they expect students to do well, grasp concepts and become contributors to the society, magically. Our respect for teachers in this country runs deep. Unfortunately, that blinds us to the gross callousness with which most of them do their *jobs*. As a result, we graduate not as informed educated citizens, capable of engaging with a wide range of people on a variety of topics, but as robots. Robots capable of working efficiently, without having the ability to position us in the grand scheme of things, without having the ability to question and without having a worldview. 

But enough about institutional education. What about how we think? Do we even know *how* to think? Are we tolerant enough and respectful enough to differences of opinion? Are we accommodative enough? Do we know our history? Do we know who we are as a country? 

In the comments section of the same video I shared, you'll see many plainly abusive comments about SC STs made without realising how bigoted they sound. The hatred for the lower castes is clear. The hatred, often, isn't even about reservations. It's about a group of people who we think don't deserve to be where they are, or more specifically, where they are being allowed to go. How oblivious, how shallow and how deeply rotten do we have to be, to pick on the weakest section of the society, the SC STs?

The tragedy is not that we are bigots. The tragedy is how we *fail to recognise* how bigoted we are. The tragedy is not that we are inherently casteist as a society. The tragedy is that we constantly *fail to recognise* how casteist we are as a society. 

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ1EgsRT1zk), an interview by Ravish Kumar of an African student, exposes just how limited our understanding is of race. He is referred to as a ""gorilla"" in nowhere else but the capital city of the country. How can we as a nation, as a colonised nation in the past, not empathise with Africans? How can we be racist to a group of people who were treated the same way as we were by colonial powers of the day? In other words, how deeply has our education system failed us, that we have lost the ability to recognise our shared history?

If you go through comments on Twitter (and no I don't mean just the hateful comments directed towards a particular group of people), you'll realise how incredibly easy we find ourselves to be insensitive, even when we're not hiding under the hood of anonymity. An Indian woman, from a religious minority, was rescued by the government from a foreign country, in an astonishing attempt that brought out in me a deep sense of respect for government officers and diplomats. And then I read disparaging comments about her family on Twitter on the same day, by religious nut jobs. Add to that the hegemony, a certain group of people hold in our society, and the whole thing becomes scary. 

Bigotry and hatred, borne out of ignorance and pure cluelessness, have become a disease. And I will not even mention Facebook here because that is a cesspool of hideous ideas. Even some of my friends and colleagues, who I've known for a long time, have in many cases become absolute hypocrites, espousing hatred towards the disadvantaged and more importantly, towards the *different*. It's not about conflicting ideas of conservatism and liberalism. Its not even about the right and the left. It's about basic decency and having a semblance of understanding about our position as Indians in the world.

I do not excuse myself of this prejudice, of course. Having become a product of this system, I've also become a victim of the same kind of regressive thought processes that haunt many. May we all strive to, at least, *recognise* this, and if possible, mend our ways. 

We deserve better compatriots. Our children deserve better peers. And most importantly, this country deserves better citizens.

Science/Technology,"How an ambulance rushed through 500+ kilometers of narrow roads in Kerala in 6 hours to transport a critically sick baby - A true story of unity, determination, and togetherness.",133,7dkd0z,fsko,15,"I had written this as a late comment on [the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7decjh/np_this_is_thameem_the_ambulance_driver_who_drove/) which blew up to get 1000+ upvotes. Someone suggested me to write it as a post to get better visibility. So, here is it.

The baby was sick in a pretty good hospital, but possibly had some serious heart issue, and one of the best specialized cardiac hospital in the country is this hospital in Thiruvananthapuram. They have researched and developed even their own prosthetic heart. 

The hospital where the baby was taken to is a super specialized hospital made exclusively to research and treat the heart disease of kids. It's name itself is Pediatric Cardiology Medical College due to its specialty. They only take extreme referral cases like this one. 

This hospital was founded before the independence by Maharaja of Travancore because his son, crown prince Sree Avittom Thirunal Rama Varma had an untreatable heart disease since his birth which led to his death at the age of six and the Maharaja wanted no one to suffer the same fate, hence such a super specialized hospital to research such diseases was created in his memory with the name Sree Avittom Thirunal(SAT) Hospital at a time period when even normal hospitals were rare in India.

Later, another bigger hospital was also started by the last Maharaja next to this hospital with more departments called Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology, Trivandrum. And, this hospital was pioneers of various things in the field of cardiac medical science in the world. The baby was taken to this hospital.

This was the reason why the baby had to be transported there instead of any other hospital in the country. It was just the best option for the survival of the baby.

**Air ambulance** was ruled out because of the critical condition of the baby who had much better chances with a land-based ambulance.

Kerala has a good road network, but the roads are narrow due to the population density of the state. At many places, it is just one lane in both directions. Any traffic can delay by a lot. The normal journey in this route will take over 14 hours, yet this ambulance reached in less than half of that time - 6hours 40mins.

This was done due to the help of some volunteers across the state. A GPS device was attached to the ambulance and the location was transmitted to everyone. There were WhatsApp groups with people around the state.

When the ambulance is near any of the volunteer's location, they will remove the traffic of that location so that the ambulance can pass without any traffic. This was how they were able to travel at such speeds through so many towns. During the entire journey, they only had to slow down once at Alapuzha. Other than that, everything went smooth. There are lot of [videos on social media](https://twitter.com/Advaidism/status/931063525493022720) of people controlling traffic at various parts of the state

Along with volunteers, police also helped. Police vehicles escorted the ambulance during the entire journey and traffic police of each district made the arrangements to make the roads as clear as possible. It helped the Ambulance maintain 100 to 120kmph speed.

This story is not just about the ambulance driver. It is not just about the driver who drove the police escort vehicles in front of the ambulance. It is not about any single individual. Instead, it is about what we can achieve if a lot of people come together as one force. It is about togetherness. It is about unity. This story is awesome because so many people came together that day to make this happen.

Few such incidents have happened in the past too. A Malayalam movie named Traffic (2011) was made loosely based on a real incident similar to this. It is an excellent movie worth watching.  Traffic movie was remade into Tamil as Chennaiyil Oru Naal, in Kannada as Crazy Star and is also remade in Hindi, with the same name Traffic (2016). The best one is, of course, the original movie.  Watch the original movie if you can, as it is a unique movie which is shot from the perspective of a dozen people in a way no Indian movie has done before.

Since most people are not reading the draft policy and trying to turn this post into how the GoI controls premier education and how bad the condition is. Look it's not that we aren't aware of it, we all know the reality but I hoped that this post will be about solutions, not cribbing about problems. Anyway here is the gist of drafted policy:

**Objective:**

To provide an **enabling regulatory architecture** to **ten public and ten private** Higher Educational Institutions to emerge as world-class Teaching and Research Institutions. (Right now we have way too many policy restriction on universities, they need approval for almost everything from UGC).

**What the hell do they mean by enabling regulatory architecture :**

These draft Guidelines & Regulations contain eligibility criteria, selection procedure, other Regulatory aspects, monitoring & evaluation, etc for World Class Institutions. These have been drafted considering the characteristics of a institutions which are world class which includes exceptionally high quality teaching and research standards preferably in multi-disciplinary areas; a significant proportion of international and meritorious students; a reasonably good proportion of qualified faculty from high-ranked universities worldwide, transparent and need-blind system to ensure intake of meritorious students; adequate financial assistance to students; a healthy faculty student ratio; well-equipped facilities for teaching, research, administration and student-life; adequate infrastructure for operations and expansion; autonomous governance structures; financial soundness through either a large corpus fund or recourse to public funding, as the case may be and, teaching and research collaborations with reputed global universities. 

The draft Guidelines & Regulations also provides for admission procedure, fixing appropriate fee structures pursuant to internal policies, appointment of faculty, collaboration with foreign higher educational institutions, and design and offer courses in existing programmes and new areas. **Additionally, these institutions shall have complete financial autonomy to spend the resources raised and allocated.**

**Expectation from World class institution:**

1.	It should preferably be multi-disciplinary and have both teaching and research focus of an exceptionally high quality. Apart from the regular courses, it should also offer various inter-disciplinary courses, including in areas of emerging technology and interest as well as those of relevance to the development concerns of countries like India. 

2.	It should have a good proportion of foreign or foreign qualified faculty. There should be a reasonably good mix of domestic and foreign students. There should be a transparent merit based selection in admissions, so that the focus remains on getting meritorious students.                          


3.	There should be laboratory facilities that do cutting-edge scientific research for those Institutions engaged in scientific research. In case of humanities and social science and other interdisciplinary areas, the faculty should be engaged in research and field work in frontier areas using the latest methodologies. 

4.	It should have student amenities comparable with that of globally reputed institutions. It should have a student enrolment of at least twenty thousand students in a period of fifteen years. The faculty student ratio should not be less than 1:10 after three years of declaration as a World Class Institution. 

5.	It should come in top five hundred of any of the world renowned ranking frameworks (such as the Times Higher Education World University Rankings or QS or Shanghai’s Jiao Tong University) in the first ten years of setting up or being declared as World Class Institution. 

**Financial assistance to WCI:**

The assistance would be up to an amount of Rupees five hundred Crore to each Institution in a span of five years from 2016-17 to 2020-21. The annual release would be dependent on the institution achieving the financial and physical outcomes laid down in its implementation plan. However, if any Institution shows capacity to absorb the funds earlier and is able to give the expected outcomes, an accelerated pace of funding would also be allowed. The funding under these guidelines would be in addition to the existing funding to which they are entitled to.

Science/Technology,Is Indian Meteorological Department really incompetent?,44,6z9gmn,souled_monk,15,"This is an excerpt from D Sivananda Pai's (Head of climate prediction at IMD) interview published in Indian Express.
[Link](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/meteorological-predictions-are-not-perfect-we-never-claim-that-it-is-a-science-we-do-our-best-d-sivananda-pai-imd/) 


**On unreliable forecasts from IMD**
>- I admit that meteorological predictions are not perfect. We never claim that we are 100 per cent right. It is a science and we do the best we can. 
- Rainfall is never equally distributed throughout the city. So, generally, forecasting the exact rainfall value over a particular location is not possible. For eg. in case of recent rains in Mumbai, the regional variation was so high that within the city itself, Dharavi recorded 56 cm of rainfall, Santacruz 33 cm and Colaba about 10 cm 
- Nature is not deterministic. It is a chaotic system. A high degree of randomness prevails and even the best of models cannot eliminate this uncertainty.
- Nature does not behave in the same manner every time, there will still be some discrepancy between the model result and actual event. We need to be aware of 
 these inherent limitations.


**On comparison with more accurate forecasts in other countries**
>- I would say it is only partially correct. We give very accurate forecasts for cyclones. Other countries have more accurate forecasts over short-range, day-to-day variation, because of radar coverage and lesser uncertainties in weather systems. However, our extended range and seasonal forecasts are much better than them.
- There is a difference in weather events in other countries and India. England lies in an extra-tropical region. Their weather is dictated by frontal systems which are much more stable and predictable. India, on the other hand, is in the tropical belt. There is more randomness in weather events.
- In the US or Europe, their entire area is tracked by radars. It gives them better short-range forecasts. We don’t have radars that  continuously monitor every region because it wasn’t considered very cost-effective. We need 30-40 more Doppler Radars. We are in the process of getting them. Once we have more radars, our short-range forecasts will also improve. But our cyclone forecast is one of the best in the world. 


**On the availability of best technology**
>- We now have a very good computer system, which will be further upgraded this December. We have very good weather models. Many of our IMD officials are in charge of technical committees at the WMO. I am myself chairing a technical team at the WMO which provides regional climate outlook. If you are not the best, you would not be picked up for these jobs. 
- India is, and now it is globally acknowledged, at the same level as developed countries in weather forecasting.
- There are many other issues that apply to meteorology in general like our data-collecting capability over oceans is not very good. Even on land, it is difficult to get data from certain areas such as Afghanistan


**IMD on world front**
>- People in the WMO take India as the natural leader in meteorology in this part of the world. Our scientists are very well respected.
- India, being the natural leader, was asked not just to prepare forecasts for South Asia but also to train other countries in the region.

Science/Technology,"Hi, /r/India! TRAI wants to know how we can hold telecom operators accountable for mobile data speeds. Here's how you can make your voice heard.",215,6esgm8,shadowbannedguy1,11,"Firstly, here is the consultation paper: [Consultation Paper on Data Speed Under Wireless Broadband Plans](http://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/CP_Data_speed_01062017.pdf) [PDF]

###**What is this?**

TRAI wants to know **how mobile Internet providers should be held more accountable for the data speeds they advertise.** Mobile data speeds are much more variable and unpredictable than fixed-line broadband connections, so TRAI is looking at whether they should make a 'label' from telcos mandatory that specifies what kind of speeds customers should expect from their connections. TRAI also wants to know what kind of tech they can use to *measure* how fast telcos' connections actually are for their subscribers.

###**Sounds great! How do I send in my ideas?**

First of all, take a deep breath. Telcos are going to have a really long answer to this consultation, and their lobbying will be polished and elaborate -- they do **not want to be regulated.** If you are a concerned citizen, you need to make your voice *heard*, not just *counted.*

Telecom consultation filings are not rocket science. You can send in a good and insightful response, and it won't take you more than an hour or two. Remember, your response **will be read**, and this TRAI administration leans towards consumers. 

**Read the consultation paper.** [Here's the link again](http://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/CP_Data_speed_01062017.pdf). Read it fully, it's only 30 pages long, and gives you enough context and information to be able to answer the questions.

**Draft a response.** This should not take you very long. You have a month to send a response in, so just spend a couple days collating all the points you want to mention in your response, order them under subheads, and work them into your answers to each question.

Make a PDF or Word Document of your response and email it to **kapilhanda@trai.gov.in**.

###**Cool! What's the deadline?**

The deadline is **29th June**. You can email TRAI and ask them to extend this deadline if you feel that this time is not adequate, and they usually do extend deadlines upon request. But try and get in on this right as telcos do, because TRAI may read responses as and when they ge them.

The deadline for **counter-comments**, which is an ***equally important stage***, if not more, where you have to counter arguments made by other responders, is **13th July**. 

###**What are the questions?**

Here are the questions TRAI wants you to answer. (emphasis all mine; text slightly edited for clarity). If you feel like you don't know the context for some of these questions, check the consultation paper; it will probably answer any questions you might have about the existing regulatory framework that telcos face.

Q1: Is the information on wireless broadband [mobile internet] speeds currently available to consumers *transparent enough* to help them make informed choices?

Q2: If it is difficult [for telcos] to commit to a minimum download speed, then could an
average speed be specified by service providers? What should
be the parameters for calculating this average speed?

Q3: What changes can be brought about to the *existing framework* on
wireless broadband tariff plans to encourage better transparency
and comparison between plans offered by different service
providers?

Q4: Is there a need to *include or delete* any of the *QoS parameters*
and/or revise any of the benchmarks currently stipulated in the
Regulations?

Q5: Should disclosure of *average network performance* over a period
of time or at peak times including through broadband facts/labels
be made *mandatory*?

Q6: Should standard application/websites be identified for mandating
comparable disclosures about network speeds?

Q7: What are the products/technologies that can be used to measure
actual end-user experience on mobile broadband networks? At
what level should the measurements take place (e.g., on the 
device, network node)?

Q8: *Are there any legal, security, privacy or data sensitivity issues
with collecting device level data?*

a) If so, how can these issues be addressed?  
b) Do these issues create a challenge for the adoption of any
measurement tools?

Q9: What measures can be taken to *increase awareness among
consumers* about wireless broadband speeds, availability of
various technological tools to monitor them and any potential
concerns that may arise in the process?

Q10: Any other issue related to the matter of Consultation.

Remember, if there's something that you think this consultation paper missed out on, include it in response to question 10.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6esgm8/hi_rindia_trai_wants_to_know_how_we_can_hold/

Science/Technology,Spoiler Alert! Only for people who have watched it or don't care if they ever watch it - My Analytical Review of the movie Dunkirk.,23,719nda,concernadian,12,"While Inception and interstellar, though fascinating, were unrealistic and defied all rules of science, mathematics and common sense, Dunkirk, is Christopher Nolan's best movie yet. I recently watched it and I wanted to key my thoughts down and see what else people may have gleaned from the movie. I gleaned something that pertains to India-China standoff(s) among other things.

So, basically, Dunkirk is about 400,000 men, British and French, stranded in enemy territory in WW2. With the enemy closing in from all sides, the British are waiting for rescue to get back to Britain which is visible across the channel from Dunkirk Situated in France. That's basically it. However, the movie spans on much more and the unique Nolan mind-wrangling makes it more interesting than the simple premise stated above.

The movie begins with a staggered timeline. It follows the pilots of the Spitfires over a 40-minute long journey to Dunkirk while it follows the struggle of the 3 soldiers with the ships and in water in trying to escape from the beach for days. It even ends with a staggered timeline following the seamen and soldiers days after the incident while following the pilot only minutes after the climax. IMO, apart from trying to capture the chaos of war, this reflects on two things - 1. The British Navy and Army have existed for hundreds of years while airforce is relatively new. It may also be symbolic of the fact that there are nations that have existed forever and they will continue to exist forever even in the face of new ones that may come up. 2. The advent of new technology makes us dependent on it. We see how dive bombers keep killing thousands and sinking rescue destroyers and the soldiers keep asking ""where is the airforce?"".

Next, it focuses on the butterfly effect. Farrier's fuel gauge is broken and he is given the choice to turn back but he chooses to stay the course and ends up saving the entire rescue. If he had just chosen to turn back, all the planes he shot down wouldn't have been shot and the rescue may not have taken place or been as effective.       
Similarly, Tommy tagged ""Gibson"" along who ends up saving their lives by opening the door on the ship sinking because of the torpedo. 

We also see that the massive and powerful destroyers are bombed by the enemy and are unable to rescue the stranded soldiers, a feat that is accomplished by civilian boats. This, to me, highlights the fact that it is not the military might of a country but the spirit of its people that wins wars - something Winston Churchill had alluded to in one of his addresses to the nation. Also, it tries to present that one should not underestimate small nations (like Britain represented by small boats) because they may accomplish feats that big nations (represented by the destroyers) may not be able to achieve. There is also another moment where the soldiers ask the civilians of the Moonstone saying ""we let you down, didn't we?"" reiterating the fact that how the military may have let the country down but the country did not let its soldiers down. We also see the spirit of the people when we see Dawson and his son heading fearlessly towards Dunkirk to rescue the stranded soldiers but the Shivering soldier, Fortis leader, is afraid to go back and many times tries to force them to change course. However, they hold steady, determined to complete the mission. We also see that civilians trust themselves to be more quick and effective than the military and all the bureaucratic red tape when Dawson doesn't wait for the navy but sets off on his own to do the exact same thing he was requisitioned for. 
 *And this is the part of the movie where I would like to mention how it relates to India. The fact that the strength of the military isn't everything in the war, the spirit of the nation matters more is why India should never cower before China. They may have better machines, we have better people.*

Next, there are elements of poetic justice in the movie. We see that Tommy, who stands up for ""Gibson"" in the Dutch boat is saved by the Moonstone but the Highlander who wants to sacrifice ""Gibson"" because of him being French and then Tommy who is not a member of the Highland regiment is forced to come up for air and is burnt alive - or poetically speaking burns in hell. Then again, Alex, who is pragmatic vs Tommy who is more moralistic in comparison face resolution of guilt at different times. While Tommy, who is more considerate and observant (remember he is the one who talks about the ""grouping"" of bullet holes), notices that the man handing out blankets on the train station is blind. When the old guy says, well done, he asks him ""But all I did was survive"", the old guy says "" That's enough"". His guilt and burden is resolved and he can peacefully sleep on the train. Alex, on the other hand, because of his superficial nature, burning guilt and less regard for others, thinks that the guy is so ashamed of them that he can't even look them in the eyes. He faces this guilt all night, even reads hatred from the people in the headlines of the newspaper and cannot look at the people until he sees that they are applauding them not spitting in their faces. This reflects on how we see in the world a lot of what we are and what we feel inside. It also touches upon the fact that ultimately, the soldiers' guilt and burden can only be lessened by the country and they feel as successful as the nation makes them feel. Their victory is not at the fronts but in the eyes of the nation and they always want validation from it. We also see this when Peter tells the Fortis leader that George will be okay even though he is dead. It suggests that it is a sort of duty of the civilians to grant clemency to the soldiers to relieve them of their burden.

Also, the movie seems to sort of touch on the fact that how one ""good soul"" is worth more than many average souls. It seems like good people keep taking the place of many average people in the movie. eg, ""Gibson"" saves Tommy, Alex, and others from drowning but ends up drowning himself. ""Farrier"" saves the 300,000 British soldiers on the beach from the dive bombers and the army that has broken through the perimeter but ends up being taken hostage by the Germans himself. It always seems like they take the place of many good people and God/ Heaven/Universe is content to exchange their one soul for the souls of many. Also, this shows how miracles don't just happen. Every miracle has a cost, the life of someone else, someone else's sacrifice for someone else's gain.

Then there is a glorification of war and our duty towards glorifying it. How young men are encouraged to die in futility many times in the name of war. We see this aboard the Moonstone as Dawson, Peter, and George set sail to rescue the stranded men. While Dawson and Peter save many men and fulfill an important mission, George only joins them because he wants to be a hero in the war zone and wants his photograph in the paper. He is just observing and trying to make himself useful but ends up dying before he could actually do something substantial. Again, the futile deaths and suffering in the war is highlighted when the man trying to escape to the destroyer gets caught between the ferry and the destroyer and ends up with crushed legs. Also, there is a difference in how Dawson and Peter look at the Shivering Soldier, the leader of Fortis air trio. While Dawson tries to understand his pain and looks at him as a human, Peter looks at him as a coward for not wanting to die in the war. In the end, however, we see how the experience changes Peter, who gives clemency to Fortis Leader by lying to him by saying that George will be fine. We see how Dawson approves of this. Again, a reflection on how war changes people and a reflection on our duty towards the soldiers and not just their duty towards the nation. We also see the irony of Dawson sympathizing with the plight of the Shivering soldier who is afraid to go into war, kills George and is trying to prevent Dawson from rescuing soldiers when Dawson's own son died in the war. We can see the effects of war on people again when the camera shows Peter and Tommy, two people of almost the same age but one weighed down by the horrors of war and the other a lad just coming to terms with the disillusionment of what war is.      
We also see that it is the civilians who make the heroes what they are. Heroes are formed when the nation accepts them to be so. We see that when Peter and Dawson get George's picture printed in the newspaper and only then Peter gains satisfaction. This reflects on that every life lost in the battle is treated with respect irrespective of circumstances for the satisfaction of the loved ones that their children/siblings/spouse did not make the ultimate sacrifice in vain, even when so many wars are futile.

Then there is the contrast in the thinking of people in accordance with their ranks and situations. The soldiers are fighting on the Dutch boat and want to sacrifice the French and then the non-Highlanders to survive. On the other hand, the French ""Gibson"" saves Tommy and Alex not once but twice, once by opening the door and the second time by slipping the rope from the boat. We also see this discord when the French soldier asks Tommy to move along from the French line at the beach in the beginning of the movie. The admiral, on the other hand, wants to stay back to help the Fench at the end of the movie. We have seen earlier in the movie admiral saying ""we should get our army back for the next battle which will happen in Britain"" but he seems dejected when Britain seems dejected when Britain seems to hold off on destroyers saving them for the next battle. Again we see how the military can let its own people down and the civilians never do. Another example is when the Highlanders on the boat refuse to let Tommy and Alex on but ""Gibson"" slips them a rope. We also see this spirit again when the civilians hail the arrival of the soldiers after all they have done is survived.On the other hand, ranks may not really mean much as we see that Farrier ends up saving the day while the Fortis Leader is a trembling mess and ends up killing a civilian. In all of this, the movie tries to highlight that soldiers, too, are just ordinary men doing their best to survive extraordinarily stressful events one minute and one event at a time.

It also focuses on how the efforts of so many remain unsung in the war. Like when soldiers accuse Collins of not being there for them aka airforce not doing enough for them at the station while Dawson reassures them they know you were there for them. Again, how the country never lets its soldiers down and how the nation's validation is important for the soldiers fighting for it.

Then there is the ending. The fact that Farrier keeps gliding even after the last drops of fuel have run out captures the spirit of the soldiers and the nation to fight until its last breath. The fact that even when dying it manages to save thousands of people by shooting down the last plane shows that even if a soldier or country is going down, it can save other people and countries and give them the miracle of living on. Of how Farrier, instead of just ejecting from the plane, lands it down and gives it a proper patriotic send-off by burning it. Which goes to show how the people of a country don't just jump off from it when it goes down, they respect it to the end even if it is burning due to war, internal struggles, whatever. It also reflects on the fact that though the main player may have gone down (Farrier) the many people who survived would, because of him, carry on the legacy which lines up with the ending of the movie which says that even if Britain went down, its colonies abroad would carry on their legacy. ( I have some words regarding that legacy of colonies but that is not the point of the movie). And lastly they show the Plane in flames but its structure still stands respectfully because of a good person like Farrier which showcases how the entire Europe burned in the World Wars (of their own making) but the spirit and the structure of Europe survived it due to the ""good men."" Again, a reflection on how the respect for a country is determined by the character of its people.

In the entire movie the themes that are common. Wars are not won by armies but by the spirit of the people. Armies may let countries down, but the country never lets it down. Poetic justice finds its way. How war changes people and the duty of the citizens to laud the soldiers who choose to fight regardless of everything.

I also appreciated small things that were incorporated. eg. at the beginning when the dive bombers bomb the beach when the explosions are far away, the sound is delayed from the visual of the explosion but when the explosions come near, the delay decreases. Something that is correct according to the laws of physics but I have never seen depicted in movies and have commented on in my head while watching the movies in the past. Then, how Tommy meets Gibson while attending nature's call. It's just wrenching that he just survived an attack on his life and then he just goes to attend his business. It is disturbing that attacks on the lives are just as routine to the soldiers as reading a newspaper is to us and the movie captures this well. Then when dive bombers throw bombs over a bridge, Tommy covers his ears. It's not the depiction of a war hero like in many other movies, its the true depiction of what soldiers are, just humans who chose to go to war and have to face horrible situations. It is also depicted with Farrier when he shows perplexion and uncertainty many times. I really liked that there was a Dutch merchant sailor, out of nowhere, he just came to help these guys. The fact that none of the army men knew anything about the tides anywhere. The fact that presence of mind helps these people more than any crazy stunts or machine guns or brawn - like when Tommy decides to take the stretcher to get aboard the ship, when Farrier keeps track of fuel by asking Collins. The incident when the Dutch doesn't understand ""ballast"" and has to be told ""weight"". Just little things that were quite meticulous.

That's all that I can put together right now. I shall add more when I think of something else I forgot to jot down or someone brings up a good point. Let me know what you gleaned from it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/719nda/spoiler_alert_only_for_people_who_have_watched_it/
Science/Technology,Kota District Collector's letter to the parents of IIT aspirants [NP],184,4i91ig,grasssrootz,40,"Dear Parents,

On behalf of Kota City, I take this opportunity to welcome your child to a city of wonders which processes the young minds of this country and fuels their passion to become the architects of Modern India.

My humble request at the beginning of this letter is to read this with some patience and time and it would be ideal if both the parents can read this together.

It is the dream of every parent to see his child touch the pinnacles of success and reach places which only few can afford. Every parent plants a seed in the mind of the child which over a period of time bears fruits but after careful nourishment and tendering since the seed is so tender that any mishandling may fail us from realizing our dream.

It is a very difficult situation for parents to leave their child in a place where they do not live and things become still difficult when the purpose for which the child is left behind is for dedicated and committed efforts in scaling excellence in education.

When parents look at the huge billboard signage/hoarding/ newspaper clips depicting pictures of young beautiful children who have achieved what they dream for their child, the resolution to inspire and motivate their children becomes still stronger.

Good career in the field of Engineering & Medicine, as the case may be, is more or less like certain insurance in terms of decent earning and living standards. I sincerely think that in most of the cases, this is the very reason that makes us dream such careers for our children.

There is nothing wrong in thinking on a certain kind of Assured Career Insurance for one’s child since limited resources and high degree of competition demands one to think ahead of times.

However, I think we all agree that the world too has changed drastically in the last 15-20 years so much so, that most of the facilities and services that were available for a limited few are now available to many due to the huge progress in technology which was witnessed in this period.

Art, Entertainment, Professional Sports, Literature, Health & Fitness, Entrepreneurship, Journalism, Photography, Event management, Music, Adventure, Destination tourism, etc, to name a few too witnessed immense growth in comparison to the bygone era.

Many of these even created a new niche which not just nurtured creative potential of the human mind and its capabilities but also were very successful career options.

Well, the point is not about asking you to see them as better options but certainly to see them also as options.

It is a matter of fact that today, young children are facing immense amount of pressure relating to their academic performance and due to the same many of them go through various levels of stress.

Even if we consider that a certain element of stress would exist in competition parental support, care and the right kind of family situations would help the child to cope with any difficult situation.

However, current reality is that due to the lack of right kind of conditions and support systems, many children are going through stress uncared and unattended for and in a few cases such situations disabled the children to such an extreme extent that they committed suicide…

Don’t get frightened suddenly as to what is being said about your child… Your child is perfectly safe and sound and you have no reasons to worry, but you have reasons to have concern of your child which I believe you will understand as we read my letter further.

I consider myself a very unfortunate person because I got a chance to read around 20-25 Suicide Notes of Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

Am I giving so many adjectives to such children because they committed Suicide?

I am sorry. Answer is No… They were in fact, as I said earlier, Young, Brilliant, Beautiful and Wonderful Children.

A Girl with an amazing command of English language in her suicide note (grammatically perfect 5-page Suicide Note with beautiful running handwriting) thanks her mother for giving up her career for raising the children… Subtle hint that she was pricked on this matter again and again.

Another girl wants her grandmother to become her mother in her next birth. Another requests her parents to allow her younger sister to do what she likes and not what they like. One tells candidly that he was manipulated to study science which was not his taste. Many simply write in fewer lines that they could not fulfil the expectations of their parents. Rather few say they were not really capable of doing what is being asked for by them.

All of them thought that Death was a much peaceful and effortless action than going through this dilemma of artificially doing what parents want them to do.

As they say “Tip of the Iceberg” reveals little and hides mountains within, similarly apparent Suicide Cases reflect numbers but reality or the hidden mountain is all those children who did not opt to take this extreme step but certainly are going through stress/worry/anxiety due to pressure on performance.

Many Parents cannot believe after the disaster that it was their own child who took such a drastic measure and I don’t mean to hurt their sentiments any further but the reality is that the child was mentally looking for some blade of grass which a drowning man searches for. That blade of grass could have been your simple appreciation of his efforts… your solacing words of comforts of asking him to do his best and forget the results your absolute unconditioned appreciation of his extraordinariness.

In return, what the child got was threats of performing still better…psychological manipulation by repeat and re-telecasting of the hardships you have gone through for the sake of family. comparison with better performers (neighbors, relatives, children of colleague, ancestors…could be anyone) sharing imagination on the loss/notional gain of social status being dependent on child’ s performance.

We need to understand that statistically speaking not many children commit suicide in comparison to the total number of children coping with such academic pressure if we analyze the numbers but life analysis tells us that their hopes and dreams are overlooked and hurt many a times. So it is high time we pause and contemplate a bit. I need to take a pause here since I hear many of you saying kids do not like many things which are good for them. So the question I tend to hear from you is… Should parents go childrenâ€™s immature ways? Not necessarily.

Well let us try to see what all good things they resisted… Eating right, sleeping right, talking right, behaving right, seeing right, listening right, reading right etc.

Child actually observes parents and never follows anything blindly. Moreover, there is one thing which is certain… Child analyses and looks at the parents to see whether in case any of those things preached are followed by parents to begin with and if so..Whether their parents are really loving, joyful, peaceful and happy by doing so.

They tend to pick up only those habits of their parents that make them happy and peaceful…In case you have seriously messed up situations, your child may even not like you.

It may appear strange and extremely annoying… But there is a possibility of your child not liking you… This comes in many forms and shades. Absolute dislike, not liking few traits of yours, not liking you by comparing you with someone better, not liking you for your over protective care and concern which you may think as love but is suffocating for the child, not liking you for your double standards (we may have…) etc.

So, is it the objective of this letter to make you realise that your child dislikes you?

Answer again is a big No.. Your child does not dislike you… I am just making a point that unconsciously we may have created such a situation, which we need to undo…

Children are parents’ responsibility and we are no one to teach a parent their responsibility nor do we intend to do so… Parents really think good for their children’s future but the point I need to make is that your dreams are always limited to your experience of what is good… what is successful… what is the best thing… Well, the truth is your child may surpass your imagination and reach places which you never even dreamed of…

We all come from different segments of the society in terms of social & economic status, culture, religion, belief systems etc. However as far the natural principle of upbringing a child is concerned they remain the same everywhere.

I am not an expert in Parenting nor have many credentials in “Right Child Care Practices” and I fully understand that different kind of children need different kind of interventions yet I would request you to divert little attention to these fundamental aspects relating to child management.

Creating the right kind of atmosphere for the child to grow and flower in home by making home a really happy, loving and peaceful place to live.
Understanding the needs of the children. There are two extremes in this case…Making the child go through terrible hardships to realise “Your” dreams is one end and the other end is over-pampered care… Both of them definitely do not work.

Take time to switch from teaching mode to learning mode from the child since children show you the way to be really happy and peaceful at times…Instead of learning form them we tend to always assume the role of teacher/preacher.

Allow the child “to be” on his own terms and here I mean especially the child’s engagement with nature and world around and empower them with the right kind of communication skills which are more accommodative. Interaction with the other gender due to their coming of age is not an aberration but a normal process, which you can keep a note on but not try to prevent it totally.

Spend time with children without complaining of your office, life situation, problems, hardships all the timeâ€¦. It may be really too late before you want to spend and there is no more time available with the child. Why? Because we may have made him just like ourselves in an effort to tutor him. We certainly are not the benchmark for the child. Many a times, we may be regressive rudimentary types in comparison to the ability of the child.

Just a final thought. Are we interested in making the child realise “Your Dreams” at any cost or should it be like creating such situations that the child realises “His/Her” Dreams?

I could have simply attended a Parents Counselling Session during admission and spoken on these issues but usually it so happens that in such gatherings we are conditioned and influenced more by impression of the person sitting next to you or people who think different.

Nothing wrong in disagreeing but it is best to disagree on own terms instead of getting influenced by others. Finally, I would like to tender my unconditional apology for taking your time and telling you things about Child Management in which I am no expert and my words in this letter have been gathered by my limited experience in Kota dealing with similar cases and certainly there are great men who have inspired me to put my thoughts before you.

Be the Best Parent in the World!!!!
I am sure there is no competition there

Science/Technology,Let's discuss the state of Indian intelligence agencies in terms of cyber power.,51,5kssg6,PM_ME_YOUR_PU55Y_,30,"While almost every week there is a story or another about the NSA, CIA, GHCQ invading the privacy of the citizens, launching attacks against cyber criminals, putting people on certain _lists_ for using Tor etc.,  Indian intelligence agencies have been off the radar. I have a strong feeling that it's not because they choose to, but because they lack the skills.

Why do you think that is?  The NSA, SIS, GHCQ, FBI etc. make it a point to hire top security professionals and even hire interns directly from universities. The candidates selected consider it as a good career path, both in terms of serving the nation and in terms of intellectual satisfaction. Compare it with the state in India, where RAW and IB don't even have a dedicated website. I understand the need for secrecy, but at least have a fucking portfolio! One cannot even directly apply to RAW. One needs to join some other government department and then one gets transferred. (like seriously?). Just have a look at [NSA](https://www.intelligencecareers.gov/nsa/), [GHCQ](https://www.gchq-careers.co.uk/recruitment-process.html), [FBI] (http://www.fbiagentedu.org/careers/cyber-crimes/), [SIS](https://www.sis.gov.uk/science-and-technology.html) career websites and then look at Indian [IB's](http://mha.nic.in/vacancies) (No, there isn't even a webpage specific to IB and like I said, one cannot directly get into RAW). Would a person who is **actually** skilled even want to apply or work here? I don't think so.

I believe that India has not paid enough attention to strengthening its cyber power. I believe that we need to have some _Kevin Mitnick_ sort of personalities to wreak havoc on the cyber security front by unlawful activities. (Instead of fakers like Ankit Fadia). Why?

* There's huge money to be made in it.
* The Indian intelligence agencies won't be able to catch you (unskilled that I think they are).
* Even if they figure out you were behind it, you could easily hide in the 1.252 billion population that India has. 
* The infrastructure to attack is highly outdated and vulnerable (For instance [this](https://www.troyhunt.com/43-203-indian-patient-pathology-reports-were-left-publicly-exposed-by-health-solutions/).).

My worst fear is that if there is a war in the future, it will be a cyber war, and India will be left devastated. It's not that we don't have the skills, it's just that the government needs a slap on its face. Like seriously, our government needs to change. How can a few babulog sitting behind desks who have no clue about technology properly shape the laws concerning cyber security and privacy? Why can't our leaders debate about such technical issues during election campaigns (like Hillary and Trump did) ? They don't because they don't feel such issues are important enough. Like I said before, we need some big hacks to happen in order to stir things up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5kssg6/lets_discuss_the_state_of_indian_intelligence/
Science/Technology,[Serious] Seeking advice from r/India since most other places have foreigners who can not give proper answer,46,5rq4gj,advic3s33k3r,26,"Hello,

I am someone who wanted to do research for a living, physics specifically, but because of various circumstances was forced to do a bachelors degree in electronics and communications engineering in India. I had previously been in a markedly Western system and could not cope but was forced to finish the degree anyway. It took me 7 years to finish with reappear papers piling up over and over again and I am now 25 years old with a low undergraduate gpa (6.122/10). I am still interested in research but I don't know where to go now. I was hoping to do research in physics (and I still am) but after some discussions I may have to change things up a bit.

I've discussed a bit about what I've heard from reddit with my parents. As far as things go financially, I am pretty dependent on them. Now from the way the discussion went down last time, I get the feeling that they might be getting impatient what with me taking so long on my bachelor's already and from what they are letting on, I should either get into a program already or get a job soon. No preparation for exams or anything unless it is going to take 2-3 months or less. I don't know if that is enough time even if I were to study night and day. Besides, shouldn't I gain conceptual/research knowledge?

From the options I have gotten from Reddit, it basically boils down to mostly getting an MSc. I'd rather avoid doing it in India mostly because I am fed up with the educational system. People just learn how to parrot the textbook instead of actually becoming skilled in their chosen field but that may not be an option because of what I did. I pretty much just followed the curriculum. No extra curriculars/research experiences. Any practical laboratory work listed in my transcripts is pretty much on paper too. I mean it's not like I haven't handled a soldering rod, some circuitry, CROs and other small stuff but, then again, who hasn't? One redditor mentioned that because of this it may be easier to do MSc in India first, get research experience and attempting post baccalaureate courses to beef up my resume, then going abroad but as mentioned before, there is the issue of what my parents will and will not allow.

The problem comes due to the intervening periods. It doesn't help that my parents despite trying to act progressive are still limited by traditional thinking. I can't exactly blame them what with money being a relatively limited resource in our family and time passing by but that is not exactly helping with my long term plans. Due to this, theoretically, I cannot take the time off to prepare for exams for the universities such as JNU's physics MSc entrance exam or something nor will I be able to work on the post baccalaureate courses since they will take time AND money. Practically, I would probably have to work to find a job and as long as I don't find a job, I would keep preparing for the exams and what not but then I have to juggle that with trying to keep up with the knowledge required for the job that they will obviously test, if not outright rejecting me based on my grades, in some prelim exam and/or the interview. That or get a clerical job but I don't know if even that is possible because of the burgeoning population.

Now my first question to you guys is if some of the following fields might be easier to pursue research in. They may be somewhat related to both my bachelor's field as well as physics and I do have interest in them. I am not asking you guys to advise me about any of them but I am putting this out in case any of you know if it would be easier for me to go into research currently in any of those fields. Anyway, the fields are:

1. Quantum information science (computing, information theory, etc.) - Our field did involve conventional computing and information theory

2. Quantum devices/electronics, though I don't really much like the sound of this. I didn't realize there was a particular distinction between conventional electronics and quantum electronics. To my knowledge, standard electronics are based on our understanding of QM phenomena.

3. Photonics - Study of optical phenomena and derivative technologies such as optical waveguides, splitters, couplers, etc., was also focused on somewhat in my field

4. Photovoltaics/Renewable Energy Research in general - Photovoltaics is probably more the focus here. I put the second part there to emphasize my intention with research in it as well as tangential research interests.

5. Condensed Matter physics. This is more general than electronics so I don't expect it to be easier but just in case...

6. Physics of computers/information - not sure about this since it seems like it could fall into information theory

7. Dynamic systems theory (control theory, chaos theory, quantum chaos, etc.)/Study of Complex Systems - Our branch did have a lot to do with (mathematically) modelling various systems in many different ways, observing the effect of various inputs and feedbacks on the outputs.

My second question to everybody is, how would I accomodate my constraints, financial constraints being of particular note? Basically, I have to get into a program but seeing as that may be very unlikely, I may have to get a job instead. But I don't know if I can get anything other than a sub par clerical job with my degree and grades and I am not sure that would help me further my long term plans. To sum up, I am really confused about the next step to take. Please advise.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5rq4gj/serious_seeking_advice_from_rindia_since_most/
Science/Technology,History of India where Indus valley civilization survives and latter is conquered by vedic aryans,1,9b4xnx,proudman4lyfe,2,"Pre vedic age 1500 BC to 1000 BC
While the Rig Veda was composed in our time line during 1500 BC and was penned down during 1200 BC . The core philosophy of the rig Veda was formulated prior to 1500 BC and the scholars debate the exact time during which it was developed.While it is agreed that the core philosophy evolved during 1800-1600 BC . The rig vedas were written in vedic sanskrit which a closely related to the early avestan language.
While the rig Veda goes into details of the life lead by the vedic Aryans and contains hymns sung in praise of gods and some parts of rig vedas deal with philosophy and metaphysical matters

vedic Aryans in our time line left central Asia around 1800 BC well before Iranians left for Iran. While I don't want to get into the arguments of whether the vedic Aryans came directly from the andronovo culture or from andronovo to oxus river valley civilization and then to Hindu kush mountains and then to mordern day Greater Punjab and from there to the rest of India

But in this time line rig veda or any other is not composed during the 1500 BC but latter during 1000 BC . In our time line the vedic Aryans did not encounter any resistance when they settled down in mordern day Punjab as the remnants of the indus valley civilization had disappeared and only a few people resided in the Punjab. These people were absorbed by the vedic Aryans. While there was certain conflicts between the natives and the vedic Aryans and also the vedic Aryans and other indo Aryans tribes but not on the scale of Iranian tribes conflicts with Scythians, Elamite, urartu and neo Assyrian empire and also other people of the iranian plateau. These conflicts played a crucial role in the unification of various Iranian tribes .With the vedic Aryans the lack of serious threats resulted in conflicts between themselves eg bàttle of ten kings on the banks of the river Ravi.

Further since the collapse of indus valley civilization the urbanization in the Indian subcontinent received a huge set back since no major urbanization takes place till 500 BC and that's after a gap of nealy 1300 years from the collapse of indus valley civilization

In our time line The indus valley civilization collapsed in and around 1900 BC which was caused due to the change in the course of the indus river and also due to the change in the climate which occurred during that time period which caused the collpase of river valley civilization around the world and also caused the movement of various tribes including the vedic-aryans and the Iranian tribes . The collpàse was further accelerated because of civil war and diseases such as leprosy and tuberculosis.

In this alternate time line the indus valley civilization survived though it initially suffered from the climatic changes and the change in the course of the indus river but it never had to suffer from the outbreaks of diseases and civil war . Thus the civilization survived and The people of this civilization adapted to the change and built new cities and settlements though the new settlement and cities were not in the size of the former cities and settlements But nonetheless the civilization survived and was recovering.
It was during 1700-1600bc that the vedic Aryans began to settle in and around the modern day Afghanistan in otl and by 1500 BC they vedic Aryans began their raids into the river valley civilization. Most of these raids were resisted and the vedic Aryans were driven back beyond the Khyber pass. The indus valley civilization at that point in time was made up of a single empire that sprung up from the times of trouble of 1900 BC . While much is not known about this empire but we know from the vedas that the empire was a centralised entity and worshipped false gods. The indus valley empire was able to defeat certain vedic Aryans tribes and Indo Aryan tribes and subjugate them. These tribes were made to pay tribute and in return the empire offered protection from other vedic Aryans tribes thus forming a effective buffer states.

This state of affairs continued till 1300 BC when the vedic Aryans in face of threats from migrating Iranian tribes and also from the pressure of the indus valley empire united under the leadership of Bharatha tribe . While this confederation intially did not cause a lot of trouble to the indus valley empire as the confederacy of vedic tribes were busy fighting Iranian and other indo Iranian tribes further north . These tribal war lasted for a century. While the vedic Aryans were not successful against the iranian tribes they were successful against other indo Iranian tribes further north and assimilated these tribes into vedic Fold further increasing in size and territories.

This increase in size caused concern to the indus valley emperor who sought to break the conferdacy up with tact and diplomacy and also by military campaign. It was during these times according to many scholars that major political changes took place in the vedic Aryans confederation. The vedic Aryans tribes over a period of time went from being nomadic pastorialist to settled farmers even though significant number of tribes were nomadic . The vedic Aryans were also influenced by the governance style of the indus valley empire and began to adopt the system of government of the indus valley empire. They aslo began to combine the elements of warfare practice of the indus valley empire with that of their own . Soon the vedic Aryans were strong enough to take on the indus valley empire.

In and around1200 BC the vedic Aryans tribes under the leadership of Bharatha tribe declared war on the indus valley empire on the ground that the empire was interfering with the internal affairs of the vedic Aryans tribes. At the time the vedas noted it was like an ant declaring war on an elephant. The empire though concerned did not make much of the threat and was thus ill prepared to deal with the new and powerful vedic Aryans

The vedas of this time line noted that this war lasted for 22 years but the major conflicts were decided in the first ten years and the last revolt of the subjugated empire occured in the 22 year after the war began . This leads us to a conclusion that the war was over by ten years and the rest of the 12 years the vedic Aryans spent the time putting down revolts

Consequences of the conquest of the indus valley empire on the vedic-aryans and history of the Indian subcontinent

A. Popularity of centralised state with a absolute monarch ruling a vast empire

Any person who has studied political science knows that vast empires create centralised state and favours absolute monarchy and vicea versa especially in a time before the advent of mordern day communication

In our time line the Bharatha merged with the puru tribe to create the powerful kuru kingdom in mordern day Pakistani Punjab but in this time line the merger does take place but there is no change on name as Bharathas in this time line were leaders of the vedic Aryan tribal confederation and as such name change is out of the question. While not much is known of the kings of the Bharatha tribe before 1200 BC but post 1200 BC there is a complete list of kings . While scholars of our time line and this time line agree that Bharatha tribe before it's meger with other tribes had a tribal council called sabha and samithi and it's society was egalitarian and democratic in nature but in this time line after the series of merger with other tribes and absorption of non Vedic Indo Aryan tribes and after assuming the leadership of the tribal confederation and more importantly the influence of the indus valley empire lead to creation of a new form of political structure ,the absolute kingship . While in our time line it was only around 500 BC that strong monarchical states emerged and it would take another two hundred years before the first empire known as the Nanda empire would emerge the same empire that Alexander the greats troops who were already de moralized refused to face the empire in war as it was said that Nanda empire had the largest and the most powerful army in the world but the concept of absolute kingship did not emerge with the nandas it was the Mauryan Empire the had the concept of absolute kingship and this evidenced by the hatered of the Maurays to the Mahajanapada and vice versa and also from Arthashastra

In this time line absolute kingship was known to the vedic Aryan tribes as it was followed by the indus valley empire and it's adoption by the vedic Aryans and the subsequent conquest of the indus valley civilization by the vedic Aryans caused a huge butterfly event . The concept of absolute monarchy much was unknown to the vedic Aryans is championed by them in this time line and this was the first major consequence and change from our time line. The consequences of this change are many folds . The obvious one is a centralised government is popular with the elites and the masses than in our time line. Further an absolute monarchy combined with a centralised state encourages unity and uniformity in political level and to some extent even in cultural level as religions in this time line in general and Hinduism in particular now champions the cause of absolute monarchy and a centralised state including large empires . Further with a history of centralised control and absolute monarchy creates an incentive for large empire because to achieve centralised control and to regin as an absolute monarch in a reasonable manner large empires are a pre requisite so instead of small to medium sized confederation that was characterized in our time line the history of India in this time line is characterized by strong authoritarian central government ruling a large empire

B Urbanization of the subcontinent

While in our timeline second wave of urbanization takes place around 500 BC but in this time line since the indus valley civilization survived and people continued to live in the 1052 or so urban settlement spread throughout the indus valley civilization at the time of its collapse in our time line. The vedic Aryans after conquest soon begin to adopt a urban life style and many more who are nomadic pastorialist settle down to become farmers in the indus valley whose population has been recovering since the times of trouble in the 1900 BC this massive influx of people from the west who begin to settle down and cultivate the fertile indus valley resulted in a revival of agriculture in the river valley not seen since the days of mature harappa civilization of our timeline

The indus valley civilization for all its advances in science and technology did not have much knowledge of irrigation system which in our time line was the main cause of its decline . While in this time line they did learn to irrigate the land and survive as a result their knowledge of irrigation was poor at best when compared to vedic Aryans who had good experiences and knowledge of irrigation systems as they irrigated the arid lands of central Asia during the middle bronze age . The vedic Aryans just like in our time line began to irrigate the land by building canals and small dams this brought in further lands under cultivation and made agriculture in the indus valley less dependent upon the unpredictable monsoon and increased the agricultural output from the land by many folds. This over a period of time lead to an increase in population of the indus valley but more importantly it resulted in further urbanization of the indus valley because of the surplus agricultural production. Thus the foundation of urbanization was secured
Further urbanization requires a strong central government as this was discussed in the previous point we can say the logical consequence of this that the central government will built new or renovate old cities to increase the control and to bring in further revenue in the form of taxes from industries ,trade and commerce
The retention of the knowledge and experience of the indus valley civilization has already been discussed in the beginning
These factors will cause an increase in the urbanization aswell as primitive industrialization which latter on spread throughout the sub continent

C Increase in foreign trade and consequently increase in the knowledge of foreign lands

While it may come as a surprise for many but the people of the indus valley civilization were proficient in conducting sea voyage and were experts in building rocks and ports . The best example of their proficiency is the docks and ports of lothal in present day indian state of Gujarat. While vedic Aryans who were not known much for their sea trade aswell as land trade . This resulted in the indian subcontinent being cutoff from the social and technological development of foreign lands as consequence of this isolation the social and economic and scientific development of the subcontinent was not shared with the foregin lands or it resulted in delayed or stunted development of the subcontinent in various areas .

An active foreign trade will have further accelerated impact on urbanisation as artisans and metal smiths and other industries have a much larger market to cater to and from the point of view of the government it will increase the amount of revenue in the form of taxes
In this time line the vedic Aryans because of the inhabitants of the indus valley civilization come into contact with Elamite, neo Babylonian empire, neo Assyrian empire, various Iranian tribes of the Iranian plateau and as a result of this contact apart from increase in prosperity as a result of foreign trade the people of the subcontinent also come into contact with foreign ideas and scientific development and the people of the middle East with that of India . While this will not cause huge butterfly effects in the political arena but the impact of this contact on religion and science and technology is not clear. There will be an increase in the speed of scientific and technological advances than what we see in our time line but in my opinion this will not result in major changes in the course of political and military events but rather a change in the standard of living of the people around the ancient world. To give an example by having contact with the people of the Iranian plateau who had advanced knowledge of irrigation systems the people of the subcontinent begin to use some of the irrigation techniques of the Iranians to improve the irrigation system of their own thereby increasing crop yields or using it to deliver water to the cities in a much more efficient manner

D. Socio religious changes

The indus valley civilization of our time had by the mature stage developed a very complex social heirrachy . While the details of this social order is not known in our time line and in this time line also the deatils are not known but the caste system that emerged in this time line may be same as that of the social order that prevailed in this alternate time line indus valley civilization but with certain changes. While this caste system is not as rigid as the caste system of our time line as it did allow individuals and communities to improve their status . It is a fact that the caste system in our time line was not rigid until the Gupta's lost power due to the invasion of hepthalites and during the islamic invasion of india this caste system further de generated into a ridiculously stupid system that emerged as a parallel power to the state authority but on the filp side it helped hindus preserve their customs and tradtion by locking them in a state of perpetual stagnation but in this time line the caste system will remain liberal when compared to our time line ,the reason for this is a strong central government and a Monotheistic religion combined with a high level of urbanization and industrial growth. Any person who studied indian history knows that when a strong Hindu state emerged the caste system always weakened and even during the zenith of caste rigidity that is during the 10th to 17th century the Monotheistic movements within hinduism emerged as the enemy of the caste system as the common doctrine of all these movements was all people are equal in the eyes of god as there is only one god we are his children. They stood against discrimination on the grounds of caste especilly the parctise of untouchability ( which in my opinon is kinda stupid) and had a common values and ethics system which kept them united and promoted group solidarity. In this time line as the form of government is centralised autocratic monarchy and the religion being Monotheistic the caste system is more like a class system and the practice of untouchability is never heard of and people of all social classes are given access to place of worship and other public places . Further in this time line the concepts of karma, papa, punya,janma , punar janma etc are present but they don't develop into a complex concepts which was used to justify the caste system as the concept of free will is more popular than vidhi or Brahma lipi or Fate in simple English fate ( but for non Indians reading this i do suggest that you google the concepts that I have written herein before and their impact on social development of indian subcontinent)

As I stated in the beginning the hinduism of this time line is MONOTHEISTIC and the hindus worship lord Brahma and regard fire as the image of Brahma and thus much like the zoroastrian people hindus in this time line also construct fire temples

The reason why hinduism in this time line borrows heavily from proto Zoroastrian ideas and beliefs is the fact that vedic sanskrit and early avestan language is very similar and since hindus of this time line are in more active contact with the Iranian tribes in the Iranian plateau which is the place where proto Zoroastrian religion was practised a lot of concepts of that religion makes its way to hinduism . While the gods of indus valley civilization are assimilated into the vedic Aryan religion as Demi gods

The reason why hinduism in this time line is Monotheistic and puts more emphasis on free will and good vs evil is because the birth place of hinduism or Brahmanism as it will be known in this time line is not limited to Punjab as it was the case in our time line but the whole of indus valley Afghanistan and Balochistan and further since the development of Vedas and other religious concepts are delayed because of the wars that the vedic Aryans fought with the Iranian tribes and other indo Aryans tribes and also the indus valley empire the vedic Aryans put more value in unity and order and the wars have a crucial impact on the society of the vedic Aryans in that the warriors and noble family establish their dominance over the priestly class as warrior are valued more than the intellectuals or people who recites hymns. Further since the place of development of hinduism is more extensive in geographical terms and is subject to foreign influence because of trade in this time line the vedic Aryans come into contact with proto Zoroastrian ideas of eastern Iranian plateau as vedic sanskrit and early avestan language are similar making it possible for the ideas of free will , good vs evils aand Monotheistic ideas to cross over from the Iranian plateau to the vedic Aryans tribes in the indus valley. What may also makes a cross over into hinduism is the concept of good and evil which has a similar concept in Hinduism of our time line as Dharma and Adharma but the concept of Dharma is much more complex than the concept of good and evil as the equivalent concept of Dharma is justice and the lord of justice is lord Yama the lord of the under world so if the concept of good and evil does make it into hinduism then it may become more mazadyasna than Brahmanism but in this time line hindus will still have the concept of Dharma and Adharma but since it is a Monotheistic religion in this time line the lord of the underworld and justice is also the lord of the universe that is the one and only God Brahma . So in this time line while the goal of moksha ( freedom from birth and rebirth) the ultimate goal of all hindus but the complex ideas of punya and papa will not be so dominant and makes its way to other concepts. In our time line the idea that deeds of a man in his previous life determined in which caste he was born in this life will not see the light of day in this time line as free will is the most important concept as God made every person capable of taking one's own decisions and if a person doesn't lead a life of righteousness he will be born again into the world . While the concept of heaven and hell is present , as a result of cross over from proto zoroasterian concepts with the concept of 7 janamas after which a person is judged for this deeds by the lord himself . Salvation or heaven or moksha means becoming one with the supreme being that is becoming a part of god ie Ahambrahmasmi which is a concept of Rigveda of our timeline remains a important concept in this time line also . As for hell well there is nothing much to say other than its hell.

While being Monotheistic the hinduism of this time line also has a concept of Demi gods that is souls of great individuals who on their death earn super natural powers but are not god . This is not a vedic Aryan concept and strictly speaking a Dravidian concept as is the case in our time line. Demi gods can be any person or an object or a natural formation such as an outstanding warrior , a great emperor, a great administrator, a mountain, a river , the sun etc while fire temples are not built for these Demi gods but shrines are build in their honour and prople evoke both the supreme being that is the Brahman and any of these Demi gods in their daily life . While intiallly any individual or object could have been raised to a status of Demi god if the people approve of it . But latter on in history the status of granting the status of Demi god became regulated by the Hindu religious order that is the clearical class of the Hindu faith interfered to preserve their power .

Being Monotheistic has an advantage of having simple religious practices unlike the complex religious practices that characterized the Hindu faith of our time line . The effect of this is there is no Buddhism or Jainism or any other counter religious movements as the main cause of all these movements is the pointless of the Hindu rituals and ceremonies whose meaning had become lost to time by then. A simpler religious ceremonies and better social system will ensure stability at the same time progress

The religious changes have been explained to some extent here and the evolution of Hinduism will be covered in other eras for example in the vedic period when the vedas are composed details of Vedas will be provided and in the changes during the Nanda empire era, the Greek invasion and the introduction of Hellenistic religion into the subcontinent and it's popularity in the indus valley and the Hindu Kush mountains, the Mauryan Empire era when the vedic hinduism reached its zenith , the civil war era when the challenge to the vedic orthodoxy became prominent, the Gupta empire era when the vedic Brahmanism was revived by the Gupta emperors some of whom were religious fanatics introduced the concept of forced conversions and religious persecution of certain religious movements, the prathihara empire which was more like a confederation than a empire they were tolerant towards the people of all faiths and it was during their watch that the Sassanian elite flee to India and the lands between khorasan and Hindu Kush mountains were absorbed, the shansabani the eastern Iranian tribes who in this time line remained Hindu it was during their regin the kings of India took the title shah Shahenshah ud Aryan ya anaryan, the various Turkic dynasty that ruled India from 1256 to 1730 the Turks in this time line some of whom convert to hinduism are usually tolerant in their outlook but some persecuted minority religion, the Maratha empire 1730 to 1905, the republic of India 1905 to present

The social structure

While not much is known about the social structure of the indus valley empire the vedas of this time line goes into depth as to how the new social structure came into being. The king of the Bharatha ,the king of kings of Aryans pratipa knew that the new subjects especially the elites will never reconcile with the vedic Aryans so he together with his samithi ( the elite of the vedic Aryans conferderation) formulated a plan to integrate their newly conquered lands into their empire. While intiallly they did not have plans of converting the people of the indus valley into their faith but latter on in 900 ad as brahmanism became powerful did religious conversion in the indus valley convert to brahmanism but even then majority retained their original faith . The vedas does make vague reference to the faith of the indus valley civilization. The faith described by vedas of this time line tells us that the people of the indus valley followed predominantly proto shaivism and shaktism while a significant minority also adhered to nature worship with host of other gods and goddesses. There were no temples or religious buildings where religious ceremonies were performed as all such ceremonies were performed in their houses or in outdoors.
The vedic Aryans flush in their victory engaged in rape and ,plunder of the inhabitants of the indus valley inhabitants and those particularly hit were the nobility as the military commanders of the vedic Aryans ordered their troops not to rape the ordinary inhabitants of the indus valley but it is documented in the vedas it self that the orders were disobeyed by a few but the orders did not cover plunder so as a result a lot of wealth was plundered from the ordinary citizens
.
The nobility and the family members of the army of the indus valley empire got the worst not only had they content with the death of their husbands fathers and brothers being slayed in the battle field now they had to put up with plunder and rape. It was this that came back to haunt pratipa ,the vedic Aryan emperor as he had to content with a hostile populace but king pratipa was a man of incredible intelligence while the plunder was going on the king emperor tried his best to ensure that no important members of the community are affected thus the traders, merchants, artisans, religious official, civil servants, engineers were safe and the merchandise of the traders were protected and this act of shrewed political calculation on the part of pratipa ensured that he wins the support of these prominent individuals who are essential to the running of the affairs once the dust has been settled .
The lands that once belonged to the indus valley nobility was confiscated and re distributed to the prominent individuals of the Indo Aryan tribes who happen to be prominent military commanders as well . While this does not lead to feudalism as only land is handed out not any legal or administrative powers and these new nobles are liable to pay taxes to the king emperor

The fate of these former noble families is tragic many were given away as wives to the elites of the vedic Aryans while the rest became peasants working in the lands that once belonged to them but some noble families who collaborated with the vedic Aryans were spared .
The caste system is as follows
1 These new land magnets formed the top caste of the society ,the fact that these families held prominent military rank aswell as vast tract of land gave them significant influence only next to the king emperor and his family in politics and latter on the top caste would also include top civil servants of the empire and the super rich of the society who were usually from the trading community and it was not unusual for these individuals and their families to be given the rank of nobility
2 The next in rank were the members of the military and the religious clergy and latter all the members of the civil service who are not belonging to the top rank and men of the books and science
3 The people in third place are the traders , merchants, metal smiths , tenants of the noble farmlands, peasant proprietor of the crown lands
4 The labour class
5 The slaves
While the details of the caste system will be dealt latter but for now let's get back to the indus valley
King emperor pratipa knew a revolt was only a matter of time so he began preparation to meet the revolt and also began to tàke steps to reduce the scale of the revolt

Science/Technology,This is the Story of my relationship with religion - A Long Read!,21,6nu3gu,modiusoperandi,12,"This is the Story of my relationship with religion:

I was in my 2nd Standard at an excellent Jesuit school in Ahmedabad when my class teacher Mrs Sinha asked “How many Hindus in this Class?”. It was for some Government count as far as I can remember. A majority of my classmates raised their hands. Then she asked “How many Muslims in this class?”, a few raised their hands. She proceeded to ask 1 or 2 more questions. I didn’t raise my hand at all. I didn’t know what those words meant, I didn’t know ‘what I was’. My bench partner on the day noticed this and complained at the end: “Ma’am, he didn’t raise his hand”. “What are you?”, Mrs. Sinha barked at me. “I don’t know”, I replied. She looked into my admission documents as I’d just joined that School and got back “You’re Muslim!”. That day I returned home and told my mother what happened. I asked her: “Mumma, what is Muslim?”, “It’s a name beta, we are Muslim”, she replied. That was how I discovered religion.


I was born & raised in an elite locality of Ahmedabad, which was predominantly Hindu but had a mix of a few others at the time. My first few years were spent in ‘Shri Krishna Apartments’ where out of 300-odd Apartments, we were the only Muslim family and this never became a problem with any neighbour ever. Our neighbours loved us and we loved them. Then in 1992, my grandparents’ home got burnt down in another mixed locality in Ahmedabad, right behind the famed IIM Ahmedabad. Some neighbours too came and joined in the loot, they were told. By this time, I had also learnt that my great-grandparents' home in the old city of Ahmedabad had been burnt a good 5-6 times over the years. Coming back to my immediate family, in 1992 our neighbours still stood by us but some people in the adjoining neighbourhood had noticed that we were Muslim and began threatening my parents to leave the place. They would wait outside our gate to threaten us when we passed. The builder of our Apartment - Kiran bhai stood by us and told us “Don’t you worry, I will deal with them”. But things kept building up. A few days later, when my father was driving his car, he was brought to a standstill thanks to a huge jam. It turned out that some BJP/VHP workers had stopped all cars and were climbing on the windshield of each to paint a Swastik. He was obviously shit scared but he stayed calm, waited for his turn to arrive, quietly got the swastik painted on his car too and then sped away like a madman.

On another scary night when rumours were growing of more riots brewing across Ahmedabad, we ran away to a family friend’s place. He taught at IIM Ahmedabad and my parents must’ve thought his on-campus-home would be a good place to hide at. Somewhere in the midst of our conversation with our hosts, loud noises from what seemed like a large group of people started coming from a distance. My parents were certain that a mob had entered IIM-A, maybe they’d heard about us hiding there. Our hosts too were obviously scared and the predicament we had put them in further troubled my parents. Then our host got an idea and said “Let me dial the watchman at the gate and ask where the mob has reached”. When he called, the watchman told him that the noise was from a Basketball match that was going on in the IIMA Campus.

Eventually things took a decisive turn. When we returned home one night, there was a paper stuck on our door, which said something on the lines of: “Last warning! Leave or else!”. That this had reached our doorstep was the last straw and my parents relented. Still, my mother was adamant that she does not want me to grow up in a ghetto and hence we moved to another mainstream locality, near the famed NID this time. Our lane was a mix of Hindus and Muslims at the time. One of the first neighbours we befriended was a lovely inter-religious couple - Indian Architects who studied in Paris. Their home in a similar Hindu-majority locality had just been attacked and they too had fled and come to this new place.

Although I was just four at the time, all these things made me further aware of Religion as a concept. As I grew up, often I was asked after a first introduction: Arastu??? Are you Parsi? First, I used to say “No, I’m Muslim”. As I grew up further, I would often lie: “Yes, I’m Parsi”. Sometimes I would say: “No no no no, I am Hindu!”. A few times when I dared to let it out: “No, I am Muslim”, I’d generally get a second response: “Oh! You don’t look Muslim”. Sometimes there would be no response but just a weird look on their face.

But regardless of whatever I said, I never felt as if I belonged to any religion. My family didn’t pray, we didn’t fast. The only time I would go to a mosque would be when my father used to take me on Eid mornings and I’d look around and rise, kneel and appear to murmur copying whatever others around me did. Post 1992, in the new Society we had moved to, gradually all Hindus moved out and it became a Muslim-only lane. So all of the boys used to gather, pray, fast and stand outside the mosque. But never me. They’d bully me from time to time, although my father’s hostility to everyone also contributed to that. I remember being bullied even for things such as wearing shorts! “Maulana says we shouldn’t wear shorts”, they’d say. “Maulana says we shouldn’t watch TV”. Sometimes when the Maulana from the nearby Madrasa used to drive by on his bicycle, they’d abandon the cricket match we were playing and hide inside the car parking waiting for the Maulana to pass. I’d be the only one still standing there wondering what just happened! We had two lovely dogs for a while and multiple complaints were made since dogs and their drool are considered unholy in Islam. I remember being called a ‘Kaafir’ and much more multiple times while growing up. My relationship with religion then could best be described as ‘indifferent’.

I remember two more instances during that period. One was when we had made a rare visit to one of our Muslim neighbour’s home and their daughter asked me to confirm the rumours she’d heard: “Tum namaz nahi padte?”, I said “Nahi”, she went on “Tumhe pata hai na ke 2 Jumme (Friday) tak namaz na pade toh Musalman nahi rehte”. My usually ultra-aggressive father too stunningly remained shut and just made an awkward face. 'Namaz nahi padhoge toh yeh hoga, aisi saza milegi, waisa gunaah chadega' - Have heard this umpteen times, yearned for someone to tell me what good it will do or at least expected them to tell me to pray out of gratitude and not fear but no one ever did, not one time. The second instance was when I got into a fight with a classmate from School over something on our Football ground. He came, pushed me to the ground and yelled: “Saale miye, ghar jala dunga tera”. I remember my first reaction to that being: ‘Shit, now the others too know I’m Muslim’. That fact had been considerably concealed otherwise because my name seemed secular (deliberately so, my mum had insisted I have that kind of a name) and my appearance or accent didn’t betray signs matching any stereotype people had in their heads either.

I don't remember seeing a Muslim girl in my lane after the age of around 10-12. They were either in burkhas or just indoors. I saw some of them the only time in their own weddings but there too, almost always, their faces and heads would be hidden. I remember another instance from this time. I have addressed my mother as ""Mumma"" my entire life, at times that ""Mumma"" would get abbreviated to ""Mu"" pronounced as ""Mo"" of ""Mother"". My school auto had come to pick me and as I came out, my mom waved goodbye and I said ""Bye mu"". A Muslim auto-mate laughed: ""Yeh toh Hinduyo ki tarah mummy ko 'Maa' bolta hai!"".

Then around 1998, I remember that one day when I heard that my best friend’s parents’ general store had been burnt down. There was no riot in the city, just a minor communal rumour somewhere and just that one shop had been burnt. I remember going to their rival’s store next door to buy something the next day. As I stood there, that shop-owner was speaking to another man and their conversation went on the lines of “You saw what I did!”, “Ya but I gave the Kerosene” came the reply.

Sometime around this, I discovered one day that my father, who had a habit of making powerful acquaintances had been communicating on inland letters with the then RSS chief K. S. Sudarshan. He used to keep some of those letters with him whenever a communal rumour flew around. Those letters would help him escape a potential mob he thought! Sudarshan called us one night for dinner to an RSS headquarter somewhere near Ahmedabad. We were escorted by a car, the time was around 8.30 PM when we reached. I remember walking past a group of about 20-30 stick-wielding men in Khaki chaddis practicing their drills, it was really scary for a child. As we walked in, Sudarshan was seated on a sofa in a reasonably austere room. 3-4 people sat around him. The first question we were asked was: “Aap ka ghar aur office kaha hai?”, my dad replied and two men got up and went to the other room, returning after a while. Till this day, it is my suspicion that none of our properties were ever targetted because of something those men noted down that night.

This became something that possibly helped us just a few years later. It was around 4.30 PM on the 27th of February 2002. I was about to leave for my tuition class when my mother called me from office. “Beta, don’t go, there’s some news of a riot, we too are returning home”. By then, I knew the drill, I cancelled all my plans and just stayed indoors. I remember my parents coming home soon after and us having a very interrupted half-sleep that night. When we woke up the next morning and stepped outside our ground-floor home, I could see thick, black smoke on 2-3 sides. One of those seemed to be from quite close by, could it be my father’s office building we suspected, as that was just at the next crossroads. Soon we heard from neighbours that every single Muslim establishment in that building had been burnt down except my father’s office. Maybe it was the note those two men made that night that helped, maybe it wasn’t.

The local TV Cable channels were playing ‘Gadar’ that day. Soon after, neighbours began gathering in the entire lane. Despite being raised by an abusive father, the tension I felt at that moment as a fourteen year old was new to me. I was scared for my life and that was because some people suddenly wanted to kill everyone who had the name I was born with! People around me were talking in a language I didn’t understand. There were talks about where we could run, who lived in what direction, people from what religion stayed in which neighbouring lanes. I had never felt more aware of my surroundings! Women and children were asked to go to the terraces to prepare kerosene bottles and throw them in case a mob attacked. Some of the more enterprising men said they will stand guard on both sides of our lane. ""Mob aa bhi gaya toh yeh aadmi kya kar lene waala hai!"" was the hushed response to that offer!

I remember my father trying to be brave and walking to one end of the lane that evening. He returned soon after and said he saw the now slain BJP Leader Haren Pandya leading a mob that was gathering at the crossroads just outside. It was many years later when my father happened to meet Mr Pandya when he told him: “Had I not been there that evening, your lane would have been burnt, I was trying to pacify the mob and steer them away”. But seeing that mob then obviously scared my father. In the meantime, my mother tried calling one family friend - A senior policeman. Always in the past, when we had called him in similar situations, he had immediately gotten a police point set up just outside. This time, to my mother’s astonishment, he replied: “Sorry, this time there’s nothing I can do”. My mother knew right then, this was different! After 10 years, it was now time for us to run again. 

That same inter-religious couple who were our first friends in the whole lane approached us saying that one of their friends leads the Police Academy, lives in the Muslim ghetto of Juhapura in Ahmedabad and has offered to host us in his farmhouse. Then we tried asking some families in our lane if they wanted to join because some space could have been arranged for them too. All of them said ‘No’. Some said they were worried about the black money, jewellery etc in their homes, some said they didn't want to run, some just didn't like my father. The police academy chief was smart, he made the watchmen outside his home wear police clothes and drive down to our home in his police car. We then rode in our car escorted by them and left our home yet again. I remember seeing this burning flame in a provision store owned by a Muslim uncle right outside our lane. I also remember seeing 2-3 mobs of 4-5 men on our way, all had trishuls in their hands, all wore saffron headbands. Suddenly this mystical area of ‘Juhapura’ seemed to be a saviour. 

I had never visited this area ever before. As we entered Juhapura, I remember someone in the car saying “Yeh border hai, hum aa gaye Juhapura”. The relief I felt entering a place I’d never been to still remains fresh in my mind.

I remember the next few nights. We stayed awake late into the night sitting on our host’s porch. We could see burning yellow lights (maybe flames) and hear loud noises and chants of mobs from 2-3 kms away, I discovered new practical laws of Science. The days would be no different. Every now and then black clouds of smoke could be seen in the distance and then it’d be a guessing game: “Woh Cargo Motors jala hoga”, “Woh so-and-so dukaan gayi hogi” and of course the phone too kept ringing. Gujarati newspapers too did their thing. I remember one popular Gujarati daily having a photo of a terrace taken from many terraces away with what seemed to be the vague figure of a man wearing something white having something in his hand and the following (translated) headline on their front page: “Who is this gun wielding Muslim?”. We returned to our home after a week or so, I was about to enter our door when one of our next-door neighbours saw us and screamed aloud: “Lo bhagode aa gaye vapas” (‘See, those who ran have returned’).

There had been no damage done to our lane but a few homes had been vandalized in the vicinity. One of them belonged to a school friend and classmate of mine, “One of the neighbours took our TV”, he told me much later. A few days after returning, I remember my mother speaking to a family-friend from our previous home - the one we had fled in 1992. She said they were so scared for their lives and even stopped going for their morning walks because they heard strong rumours of trucks full of Muslims coming to burn them from Juhapura. I think I almost laughed. I also remember how one night, many months later, when my father and I opened the door to the room where my mother was sleeping, she woke up startled, stood up and started howling at the top of her voice. She thought we were rioters who came to kill her. After pacifying her then, we eventually laughed it off over the years.

Two memories stand out additionally from this time. It was somewhere in March 2002 I think. We barely left home and everything seemed gloomy all the time. I got a call from a school classmate of mine inviting me to his birthday party. I couldn't understand his frame of mind and I think he couldn't understand mine. The second memory relates to yet another major change that happened in my life. My parents didn't feel comfortable sending me to my beloved School anymore as it was in a Hindu area. Remember this was March, final exam time was close and I was in my 9th grade. My father had a few calls with my school administration, they understood and gave me a promotion that year. For the next academic year, I was moved to another Jesuit school in the old city that had a healthy Muslim population. I have been asked several times why I made this strange move since the school I left was the one everyone wanted to go to, I have often cooked different stories up each time.

Soon after, my parents began working at riot relief camps. I remember my mother going to those camps quite often. I had been once, some NGO was getting kids there to draw. I remember this one girl having drawn a red haired monster. Soon my dad revived his old NGO and took it up full-time with my mother. I remember this one survey my father got conducted with some pedestrians around Ahmedabad. One of the questions was: “What do you think of Juhapura?"" (the same area we had escaped to). Some of the answers were: “It’s mini-Pakistan” to “There is a helipad there where helicopters from Pakistan bring missiles for war with India”. I also remember us stumbling upon these pamphlets from somewhere. They claimed to be published by the VHP/Bajrang Dal and their text in Gujarati read something on the lines of: ""These Muslim boys are very handsome and they fool and take away our Hindu girls later converting and marrying them. Let us open Gyms and beauty centers in Hindu areas too so that our boys too become handsome.""

Life moved on. Social activists began coming home, some film folk came too, there was lots of activity. An year later, mom and I finally left my father. Much later I discovered what had triggered that high a sense of empowerment and confidence within her after having been trodden upon for so long. She told me that in one of her visits to the relief camps, a woman came up to her and began howling: “Aap educated Muslim aurat hai, aap hamari haalat dekho, aap hamari madad nahi karenge toh kaun karega!”. 

That moment, she was liberated! The pain of 2002, the pain of that woman gave her a strange sense of empowerment. She realized that she did not need to bear anything, her pain wasn't the largest, she could be free, she could empower others too, she could still have a happy life!

Eventually she joined an iNGO and soon started the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (Some of you may know the name from the recent Haji Ali and Triple Talaq cases). I was fifteen when we left my father. Life became shockingly kind to me ever since I got out from those clutches. It was truly beautiful, I wasn’t good-for-nothing as I had been made to believe, I had skills too, I was liked too. After this ordeal, a lot of acquaintances too opened up to me on their respective domestic issues, I realized I wasn’t alone. After a period of selfish enjoyment to satiate my sense of being deprived, I became really passionate about empowering young people and started a non-profit. We worked for 6 years with about 6000 College youth educating them about issues such as Communalism, Gender, citizenship, even happiness.

I remember this one time when we took a group of Hindu youth from a mainstream College to Juhapura for an interaction with about 20 local girls from there. On the eve of our meeting, a lot of their parents warned them: “Are you sure you need to go?”, “Be careful, very bad people stay there” and so on. Most of them still came, we still went. That interaction was amongst the most beautiful moments I have ever experienced. These folks connected with those girls on so many levels. They were laughing, sharing anecdotes. Those girls said how they have never gone out of Juhapura, these youngsters shared how their problems seemed so much like their own. As we left, they hugged and invited each other to their respective social functions. The walls had been broken, at least for those 10-15 people we had taken that evening. I remember this other time when I took the same group to visit the worst-hit Naroda Patiya riot-victims. Every single victim, without exception, said: “Hindus aren’t the problem. There are good and bad people amongst both. This was the work of politics and politicians”.

On the opposite end, I remember this time when my grandfather came home one evening. Although he once prided himself on being irreligious, by this age he had a long beard and was always in a traditional white kurta-pyjama. He told my mother: “Beta yeh NGO ka kaam toh thik hai par Arastu ko bol thoda deen (religion) ka bhi kaam karey”. My mum replied: “Papa, aap ne jitna religion ka kaam apni zindagi mein kiya hai, us se zyada isne itni umar mein is NGO se kar liya hai”. I also remember how members of the Tablighi Jamaat would come to my home sometimes. Their job was to propagate Islam further and despite knowing I have never once prayed, fasted or gone to the neighbourhood mosque, they kept coming trying to patronize me into coming to the mosque. I remember one particular line said by an elite member of their group: “Aaj kal Musalman bachho ka dhyan bohot zyada Science aur Technology pe aa gaya hai. Woh sab toh theek hai par deen (religion) pe dhyan do pehle”.

As time passed, my mother finally met a kind, loving man and they got married. He happened to be a Brahmin Hindu. Interestingly, he devours Chicken and my mother loves Dosa. On my work front, things were moving at a decent pace. I was selected as Indian delegate to a Workshop in Bangkok, that was my first international trip. I remember this one time when I was walking through a flea-market and all of a sudden this cart full of hanging ducks and pigs came in front of me! I felt gross. That entire trip remained a struggle in terms of food. A fierce non-vegetarian back home, I struggled to find simple chicken to eat as there were all other kinds of animals there I found creepy. That moment, the whole Veg/non-veg debate back home, especially the religious flavour it is given in Gujarat, took a whole new turn in my head. It has nothing to do with religion or right or wrong I realized, it's just habit!

Soon after, the Public Affairs Unit of the American Embassy backed the NGO I was leading. Somewhere down the line they selected me for their International Visitor Leadership Program and sent me for a trip to the US. We were meeting with Senators and people from the UN and US Govt, we met iNGOs and more. Towards the end of the trip, I discovered that the introduction page that had been given to all the guests listed me as a “2002 riot survivor who was working with Muslim Youth on preventing them getting radicalized”. Everyone was nice to me, I was the star! It was ‘positive discrimination’. But that introduction couldn’t be further away from the truth, I was not a ‘riot survivor’, there were people who had lost people and property of their own, I hadn’t. And I wasn’t working with ‘Muslim Youth on preventing them getting radicalized’. I was in fact going to Colleges trying to educate Hindu Youth on communalism and more. I remember telling an American friend: “I don’t think I have been made to feel as Muslim in India as I have in America”. Towards the end of my trip, I remember calling my mother from America one night to tell her: “Mum I’m done, I’m leaving the non-profit world”, “Whatever you feel is best Beta!” she replied.

Moving on, I remember one thing an ex of mine used to tell me: “Tu Muslim nahi hai! Please! Maine keh diya bas!”. It made her more comfortable to think of me that way. Romantic relationships have started for me only after lengthy discussions on my religion, some didn't start at all because of the same and I am also aware that further intense struggles await me. I have also often been told “…par tu waisa nahi hai” after a barrage of insults about Muslims. I remember a friend of my girlfriend’s asking her during the planning of an outstation trip: “Yaar, can we go with a Muslim!”. I also remember that time when I was at an event in a College when students are supposed to be dressed by themes. I was wearing a turquoise Kurta and blue Jeans and this one student came up to me and asked: ""Tumhare group ki theme Al-Qaeda hai kya? Kurta pehena hai!!!"". To this day, I feel uncomfortable wearing a Kurta!

By this time in my life, I knew I was an atheist. Fiercely and irrevocably an atheist. I remember being on a trekking camp in Manali when some co-travellers asked me “Aap ka kya religion hai bhaiya?”, I said “Guess”. They tried everything from Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Parsi, Buddhist, even 'Indian' and 'Human' but they couldn’t guess ‘Atheist’. I let it remain that way. I distinctly remember what one of them did when we returned to Ahmedabad. We got off the bus and were waiting for parents to come and pick everyone up. A boy kept nagging me: “Bhaiya, bolo na, kya religion hai aap ka?”, I kept playing around, avoiding. Soon after, his dad arrived. As he sat behind his father on his scooter and the scooter sped away, the boy turned around and screamed one last time: “BHAIYAAAA BOLO NAA KYA ANSWER HAIIII?????”.

Over the years, people in my family married Hindus, Christians, even a Dalit. I remember wearing a Sikh kada on my wrist out of some fascination I had once. I have kept a tiny Buddha statue in my pocket at times. There are idols of Hindu gods in my home that were gifted to me, there are gorgeous Madhubani artworks of Hindu lords we have, there is also a stunningly beautiful Janamaz (on which Muslims offer Namaz) in my home. I have been to many more temples in my life than to mosques, simply by not saying 'No' each time I've been on a tourist visit to a new place. Have accompanied people to temples and mosques when they asked me to, they would feel good they said and I didn’t mind!

Later, I started-up in 2012. I was the only founder out of the 3 co-founders who couldn't have his name on the office lease agreement, we wouldn’t have been allowed to get that place if I did. To this day, a lot of my Hindu friends in Ahmedabad have no clue about this long-lasting, cemented phenomenon and their shock never ceases to amaze me. Most 20 odd year olds today in at least Ahmedabad have hardly ever interacted with Muslims, because after 1992 and then 2002, most of the ghettoization is complete. Muslims escaped or were forced to leave to live only with Muslims and Hindus moved out to live only with Hindus. Pull up a map of Ahmedabad and I can show you exactly who lives where and there won't be more than a few countable exceptions. And not just Ahmedabad, my cousin in Bombay was made a product for TV debates on the one hand and right-wing trolling on the other when she expressed how it's been tough for her to get a home because of her religion. 

I also remember the time when one of my co-founders was warned by friends: “Be careful, you are about to get into business with a Miyabhai”.
After 9/11, plus lots of global terror attacks over the years and now Trump, I am sometimes told by friends ""Hey you have sometimes wanted to move to Silicon Valley, right? Do you think you will be allowed to now?"". Have had several debates with Muslim acquaintances online and offline about how killing innocents in the name of religion is plainly wrong and is also harming Islam itself! 'Islam isn't flawed, some of its practitioners are' has been a common answer. On a political note, ""Congress or BJP?"" has often been a question put up to me with a visible expectation of me saying the former. To this, a line I read somewhere on Facebook sums it up best: ""Main Musalman hu. Main marna nahi chahta. Is liye filhaal main corruption se kaam chala lunga"". 

After 2002, the Gaurav Yatras and more, a lot more got thrown my way but now it is made to seem as if it never happened. I remember this conversation a Gujarati Hindu gentleman was having with a curious non-Gujarati traveller in a train compartment I was sharing back in 2003. ""It was necessary to teach a lesson to these Muslims. They used to kill our Cows, they used to convert our daughters but now they are scared. Haan yeh aurato aur bachho ke saath thoda zyada ho gaya par overall theek hi hua."" When the other gentleman seemed to disagree and then went to the washroom, this guy told the others: ""Lagta hai Muslim hai!"".

Somewhere around last year, the Triple Talaq struggle my mother and her courageous colleagues were fighting for over 10 years picked up steam. Their interactions with tens of thousands of Muslim women across the Country had convinced them of the damage being propagated to women in the name of religion. That even the Quran - the holy book they all consider themselves reverent to, had no mention of Triple Talaq added further fervour to the fight. 

In response, hundreds of Muslim men, even some women would attack my mother and her colleagues at events, meetings, on TV debates. WhatsApp messages were broadcasted by the thousands about not just her but about her ""atheist son and Hindu husband"". Somewhere along the way Prime Minister Modi and the ruling BJP climbed onto the Triple Talaq bandwagon. Now those Muslims who felt threatened by my mother and her colleagues got a new weapon to target her with: “RSS Agent”. Life took a full turn, made a complete circle! And all of a sudden the same people we felt threatened by all our lives were being accused of being her friends and backers. Soon the political sloganeering and posturing died down but her struggle, their struggle continues and will keep doing so. Before writing this post, I called her to ask: ""Mumma, if I write a post about my relationship with religion, can it harm you or your work?"". ""Your thoughts are your own and they should absolutely be shared, fiercely and openly, don't you ever worry"" she replied instantaneously. The day I decided to drop my father's secular-sounding surname and use my mother's first name as my last name, I knew my identity shall become a lot more visible but it is too small a price to pay for the respect I want to give to her.

My latest tryst with religion was when I went to the #NotInMyName protest at Jantar Mantar just a few days back with my new employers/friends. Several innocent people had been lynched in the name of religion, this time the reason used was ‘Beef’. And then just a few days later, the terrorist attacks on innocent Hindu pilgrims on their way to Amarnath occurred and I remember the same old, familiar feeling coming back yet again!

Who am I fighting, who do I hate, they’re all the same regardless of their name or appearance, who is mine and who is the other, what is the solution, is there even one, is one religion the problem, are all religions the problem, is religion itself the problem, if religion didn’t exist wouldn’t the perpetrators just create something else to use!

Who do I belong to, do I belong to anyone, Who am I? But interestingly, the answer to these questions have been the clearest out of all the above. The others absolutely evade me.

Most of my good friends today are atheist or irreligious, most of them are scarred, most of them have stories of their own. I remain an observer to religion and this is an account of what all it has done to me so far! Let’s see what more you have to offer, dear Religion!

Science/Technology,Can I get some career advice?,11,78mw0r,hashedout,9,"I'm doing B.Tech in CS from a tier-3 college. Recently, companies have started coming in our colleges for campus recruitment and I have managed to secure a job in a mid-sized company at 4LPA(3.5 in-hand) but the problem is that the company is asking for a 3 years of bond agreement. Also, I got in touch with the employees and they told me that promotion is near impossible. That is the reason why I'm posting this here.

Now, although more companies paying higher salaries or offering better jobs will come to our campus, are there any other ways from which I can get a job? Hackerearth (suggested by someone) is a good place but all the hiring challenges require some industry experience. I've been told by my seniors to start using Linked-in and Angel to network and find jobs. I'm confused now about what should I be doing? Should I focus on competitive programming and problem solving skills, should I learn new technologies which I can show on my resume and/or build new projects.

I still have a semester left and I want to get as high-paying job as I can get to get to the 1.6LPM crowd.

Science/Technology,What else can I career in apart from engineering?,8,781583,wantout2325,8,"Hi all!

Over the past few years, I have become very jaded with computer science and engineering. Everytime I sit down to code for a job or assignment it feels like a meaningless task to me.  As a result, I find it tedious and I am not able to put in any effort that amounts to original work or learning. Computers have become boring to me! Moreover, I have developed cervical pain and think that I cant continue a career that requires me to sit in front of the computer all the time.

On the other hand, I have become more and more interested in the wider currents of the world covered in the social sciences like political economy or philosophy. Issues such as the impacts of technology, social organisation, policy,etc seem more important to me than the next great programming language or the iphone.

I am also interested in moving out of the country for reasons mentioned here - https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/77z7a8/which_country_for_masters_and_further_job/

Text from the release,

**Cabinet grants ‘in-principle’ approval to the LIGO-India mega science proposal** 

The Union Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has given its ‘in principle’ approval to the LIGO-India mega science proposal for research on gravitational waves. The proposal, known as LIGO-India project (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory in India) is piloted by Department of Atomic Energy and Department of Science and Technology (DST). The approval coincides with the historic detection of gravitational waves a few days ago that opened up of a new window on the universe to unravel some of its greatest mysteries. 

The LIGO-India project will establish a state-of-the-art gravitational wave observatory in India in collaboration with the LIGO Laboratory in the U.S. run by Caltech and MIT. 

The project will bring unprecedented opportunities for scientists and engineers to dig deeper into the realm of gravitational wave and take global leadership in this new astronomical frontier. 

LIGO-India will also bring considerable opportunities in cutting edge technology for the Indian industry which will be engaged in the construction of eight kilometre long beam tube at ultra-high vacuum on a levelled terrain. 

The project will motivate Indian students and young scientists to explore newer frontiers of knowledge, and will add further impetus to scientific research in the country.

I thought maybe some GPS tracking issue.

I went to gate to collect but he did not show up, so I called him and he again said within 2 min he will be there.

Finally he delivered food, When I checked gravy I found quantity was less than usual (50%). Also some gravy was over the package. I immediately felt something is fishy. I suspect that he took away some part of food.

I opened app and checked for help but to my surprise order status was still not showing delivered. I could not report the case.

After waiting for while I cancelled order from my end to get refund and got 100% back.

I was waiting for call from the delivery guy or swiggy but there is no call so far (more than hour now).

I dont think swiggy is at fault here and I am also not 100% sure with my suspicion.

He’s told me that in India, it’s rude to refuse food, and that hosts will often push you to eat more than you might otherwise need/want.

The problem is that I am recovering from an eating disorder and it’s really important for me that I listen to my fullness cues otherwise I’m super prone to relapse. 

It’s also troubling because many members of his family are overweight and I am really nervous at the thought of visiting them and being pressured to eat more than I am comfortable with.

I want to enjoy my time and also not feel pressured to overeat, while not coming across as rude.

Food,"Drinking hot water, avoiding cold foods - prep for the virus",4,fpc6tw,olivawDaneel,20,"This is a question for the doctors of this subreddit or anyone who can answer it with any kind of authority. Personal anecdotes won't really help me much.

So every Indian parent has always been a strong advocate of drinking warm water or hot water and all kinds of other shit like milk with turmeric or gargling regularly even before the virus. But now they have more ammunition. Now you have to do these things if you want to beat the virus. I also want to include vitamin C tablets to the purview of this question as ""they boost immunity"". 

I'm not going to argue against whatever health benefits these things might have normally. I'm sure they're great. But my dad has a whatsapp recording of some guy who has a friend in China (idfk as if that claim makes the recording more authentic) where the guy goes through a list of things to help you prep against the virus. 

He makes a case for how warm water doesn't let mucus collect and takes it to your stomach where gastric acids deal w it. And says to avoid cold foods during these times. Alnd take vit C. And gargle regularly.

I guess my question how exactly do these things help against the virus, if at all?  And if they don't how do I convince my parents to calm down?

I also want to add the reason for my cynicism is I've heard doctors say that you can try supplements for improving immunity but nothing can really help you from getting the virus. And don't cold foods only worsen the symptoms of an existing cold virus instead of causing it? No one is implying eating ice cream will give you corona but their implication is that eating cold foods will make you weak against corona.

Food,Top of the food chain? Think again.,15,fkens9,decipherseattle,7,"It only takes a small nanometer dimensioned entity to bring the entire human race to a halt. Whatever happened to WE the pioneers. Imagine, this was going to be the year in which we were going to put ideas like autonomous cars, flying cars, space tourism, asteroid mining, hyper-looping etc in action. Now, we are rushing to the grocery stores and fighting over trivial things like paper to wipe our backs. 

There is a quote in the movie Interstellar:

*”We’ve always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. But we lost all that.
Or perhaps we’ve just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we’ve barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us”*

It almost feels like that our systems, our unity, our spirit, our patience and our human sensitivities are all getting tested at the same time. The Hope that there is another tomorrow keeps us all moving and fighting. 

It however goes without saying the C-scare has truly shown the fragility of our existence. We need to pause. We need to think what is truly important. We need to focus. It is time to rethink. We have not found another worlds. We have not found a way to escape yet. 

This is it. Let’s push this out and remember to not go back to our arrogant ignorant selves. Else, we will waste a perfect disaster to evolve as Humans first.

Food,A long read but definitely provides much food for thought! Would like to know your thoughts on this.,1,fsagi8,dennkiesauros,6,"A comprehensive summary and analysis by Jaideep Varma. 

""If you're one of those who cannot bear an alternative opinion, please don't burden your dainty mind further. But if you're fine with wading into a fresh perspective that has no pretensions of being the last word, some of you might just find this constructed case below worth your time. 

It seeks to examine if there has been an international overreaction to Coronavirus, entirely in synch with the polarised world this virus was born into. 

Let's proceed fact-by-fact. (All stats from the public domain; have aggregated to actually provide a conservative estimate. References in first comment). I've tried to simplify this as much as I can, for easy comprehension. 

1) 
The following are the fatality rates of Coronavirus in different age-groups: 

0-9 yrs - 0%; 10-19 yrs - 0.2%; 20-29 yrs - 0.2%; 
30-39 yrs - 0.2%; 40-49 yrs - 0.4%; 50-59 yrs - 1.4%; 
60-70 yrs - 3.8%; 70-79 yrs - 8%; 80+ yrs - 15%. 

So, even an infected person of over 80 years has an 85% chance of survival. It is important to understand that Coronavirus affects mostly people with pre-existing conditions, which is why the fatality rate really starts notably increasing from the age-group 50-59. 

(Also, the rumours about more men dying are true; the proportion is roughly 70:30. Given that this is a respiratory disease, this discrepancy has been linked to smoking by some experts, not to any specific targeting by the virus).

2) 
The following is the approximate outcome for infected people: 

95% infected people need 2 weeks to recover with no medicine, from home. 
5% need hospitalisation.
2% need ICU.
1% need ventilator.

So, the vast majority of infected people can just recover by staying at home, with no medicine. Even seemingly well-educated people don't seem to grasp this properly. Please hold on to this fact. 

The big concern for authorities is for a large number of cases to be in that 5% when there are fewer hospital beds available, and especially in that 1% where there is a considerable shortage of ventilators.  

3) 
In warmer countries, for some reason that is still not clear, the fatality rate is considerably lower than other places so far, and the overall fatality rate of about 4.5%. 

Brazil: 2.7%; Malaysia: 1.2%; Thailand: 0.4%; Saudi Arabia: 0.3%; India: 2.3%. (The two outliers are Indonesia and Philippines with 8.4% and 6.7% but experts have stated these figures have emerged due to very low testing in that part of the world; more testing would lower the fatality rates considerably). 

Low testing is a big problem in India as well. However, there are no reports of people with symptoms crowding hospitals as there are in many other countries. And it is important to understand that if there are indeed many latent cases as is feared, that would actually bring DOWN the fatality rate. 

Death tallies can't be faked and it is hard to hide the dead - that is the key number, and that is 20 over ten-odd days. Even with limited testing, the average number of new Indian cases is in the region of 100-120 a day; it has been like that for a week. Which means there is absolutely no evidence of exponential community spread till date in India. And that has so far been the case in all of the warm weather countries. 

4) 
In human history, untreated illnesses and unvaccinated viruses have the following as fatality rates: 

Rabies - 99%; AIDS 80-90%; EBOLA 87%; Smallpox - 65%; Bubonic/Pneumonic Plague 52%; Tetanus 50%; Cholera 47%; TB 43%; Chickenpox 30%; Typhoid 15%; SARS 11%; Spanish Flu 10%; Zika Virus 8%; Yellow Fever 7.5%; Diphtheria 7.5%; Coronavirus 4.5%; Measles 2.5%; Swine Flu 2.1%. 

So, Coronavirus has among the lowest fatality rates in history.

This is the first virus to travel so far (199 countries) in this new world, polarised more than ever before in human history by social media and mobile technology. A global virus in an intensely globalised world should not be a surprise at all, spreading during peak travel season, both, domestically in China and internationally. The virus itself is more contagious than most other viruses that came before, but not by such a great margin. 

There have been many pandemics in human history, many of them far, far worse than this one (in terms of fatalities). But the reaction worldwide has been fraught with anxiety and panic in the face of the uncertainty of having no cure yet. 

Incidentally, uncertainty is a condition that people in this new world (mobile social media) deal with far worse than any previous generation in history - this has been well documented and discussed in recent times. Has that had a greater say this time than the pandemic itself? 

5) 
WHO estimates deaths arising from common flu to be between 290,000 to 650,000 people every year, at a fatality rate of roughly 1%. Coronavirus has killed about 27,000 so far in about four months, with very limited testing in many parts of the world (truer testing would lower its 4.5% fatality rate considerably). 

Also, two recent studies done in Italy comprehensively show that ""less than 1% of the deceased were healthy persons, or persons without pre-existing chronic diseases."" Which means, in the face of so much focus on Coronavirus, it is not clear in many places ""who died FROM the Coronavirus and who died WITH the Coronavirus"". 

Incidentally, between the five winter seasons in Italy between 2013 and 2017, there were 68,000 deaths from common flu. That means an average of about 4,500 deaths a month during the winter season (where February is the peak month). This has very emphatically been a trend in the last decade in Italy anyway - of elderly people dying in droves from flu during the winter months. Does Italy's death toll of approximately 9,000 in three months due to Coronavirus seem high in light of this? Especially when the Italians themselves are not sure in many cases if the patients are dying of Coronavirus or merely with it. 

The US, who have just overtaken Italy on number of Coronavirus cases, have an even more sordid record when it comes to the common flu. In the 2017/28 flu season, the US registered 61,000 deaths from flu. That's an average of over 10,000 deaths a month! In the 2018/19 flu season, there were 34,200 deaths - that's 5,700 deaths a month. So far, there have been about 1500 deaths from Coronavirus in the US. 

It is worth repeating this - the Coronavirus has killed about 27,000 in four months, while an average of WHO's tally of common flu deaths every year is about 39,000 deaths PER MONTH and critically, within EXACTLY the same patient base. And recent studies in Italy have found that it is not entirely clear if many of the patients actually died from the Coronavirus. 

This is a huge point that will no doubt be explored in great depth by the medical fraternity in months to come. But it is worth thinking about this - what would happen if there was intense 24-hour media scrutiny worldwide on the common flu deaths - at the rate of about 39,000 a month worldwide ? What would it do to our minds? If we discount the absence of uncertainty (as common flu has prescribed cures, which is why the fatality rate is low) would it not lead to a similar brand of panic that we see now? (This disproportionate panic is apparent in the smallest things; like, despite WHO and the American Surgeon General categorically saying that masks are useless unless a person has definite symptoms, there has been a frenzy for them.) 

Obviously, this is not at all a case to downplay the Coronavirus pandemic. It has to be combatted, and the key ways are well-known by now - social distancing, regular hand-washing, quarantines, and closing down travel. A lockdown in places where there are signs of community spreading is definitely desirable. Even as a precaution, this is a good option, for a limited period.   

Beyond dispensations and politics, this is about worldwide frenzy and alarmism, accentuated by a mainstream media that comprehensively leans towards worst-case scenarios in the name of erring on the side of safety. And many people are unable to adjust their mind to the fact that those are worst-case scenarios and that ""experts"" in most fields do not even agree with each other, and so get stuck on pessimistic, and often outlandish views as the most credible one (which in turn gets perpetuated). It is a perfect pointer to our times how so many react violently to that singular view being questioned, and alternative views derisively dismissed without its facts examined at all. (This does make one wonder about climate-change alarmism as well. For example, it is worth remembering that before William Nordhaus won the Economics Nobel in 2018, climate change anti-alarmists were equated with climate deniers.) 

But here's the kicker. Why is it that the far higher death tallies of flu in recent years, in exactly the same patient group as that of Coronavirus, never got the kind of attention that the Coronavirus tallies have received? Could it have something to do with the largely modest economic and social classes getting affected by the common flu? And the travelling/ jet-setting classes of people who are affected by the Coronavirus? Couple this class consciousness (and the blatant sacrificing of the worker class in some countries, like India) with the fear mongering that the political class relies on to subjugate the masses, at a time when leadership standards all around the world are at an all-time low than ever before in human history, and we have a lethal combination. 

Yes, Coronavirus has changed the world but is it because of the pandemic itself or because of how all of us have responded to it?""",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fsagi8/a_long_read_but_definitely_provides_much_food_for/

We don't have enough road network in our country, so  self-driving cars won't be a thing in our country, even in say 25 years  from now and car ownership is at max 30M. Other forms of vehicles like  self-driving ""autos"" or some sort of a pick-up robotaxi vehicle will be  huge in our country.

Food,"Randians who can’t tolerate spicy food, how do you manage living outside?",30,et4tez,fireheart727,25,"No one in my family has decent spice tolerance. How do I explain it, not only I feel burning sensation in my mouth and chest but it also feels uncomfortable after eating & I have a hard time digesting it. Maybe it’s because of genetics. By spice I don’t mean just chilli but other spices too.

Back in home, all things are cooked without spices. Wedding ceremonies become a nightmare sometimes. Fortunately, I’ve a sweet tooth to make up for it and enjoy sweet things in general. 

After 12th I moved out and went to Kota for medical preparation. And food in my hostel was absolute nightmare (but average according to others), I suffered from acidity & sickness the entire year. Situation didn’t improve all even in my college life with the limited things I can eat. Also, I can’t eat outside with the few friends I have, unless it’s McDonald’s or KFC, which is rare since most of time they hang out, they always prefer dinner at some restaurant instead. Eating just Hakka noodles & salad isn’t worth it.

Edit: *I’ve read that our taste buds and nerves use various proteins (called TRP channels) to detect various substances that give most spices their distinctive taste. Most of these proteins are activated by many different spices. Our spice tolerance depends on our genetics, people have mutations of these proteins which influence our final sensation of spices since most food have blend of different spices. People who have TRPV1 protein mutated they’re less susceptible to capsaicin in chillies (chemical compound that causes burning sensation after eating chilli).*",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/et4tez/randians_who_cant_tolerate_spicy_food_how_do_you/

Food,"Goa is STARVING due to 100% lockdown, and I need you to know about us",1717,fp83fz,KenjanRozu,159,"I cannot take this anymore! The retarded CM of Goa has imposed a full lockdown. This means that NO grocery shops are allowed to open. I might survive for a week by eating a single meal per day with a dangerously compromised immunity during this ongoing pandemic, but think of the numerous infants and elderly dependents who need supplements and special medications and form the most vulnerable sections prone to COVID-19.

**The state of Goa has also breached the centre's direct order by shutting down ALL food supplies and outlets in the state.**

Foreign nationals stuck in the state are already trying to get international media's attention to this crisis , but we need more voices!

The nail in the coffin for me was seeing [THIS](https://twitter.com/ArvindKejriwal/status/1243078456671236098) tweet by Delhi's CM. He's allowed 24X7 operation of all grocery stores in his jurisdiction which felt like a gut-punch as a Goan. We haven't had fresh supply in nearly five days!

Please do not trust any news outlet or journalists claiming that Goa has things under control. Goan government's policy is literally murdering its own people to tackle COVID-19.

If Corona doesn't get us, starvation surely will. If you can, at the very least, tweet, tag, or shame the Goan administration. It's a total nightmare!  


**EDITS:**

Someone just filed a petition against Goa's government:

Government just abruptly closed down the entire nation. What arrangement did it make so that the poor reach their homes along with their familes safely? It is not as simple as booking a cab or renting a car for them. People are literally walking miles and miles to reach home. Why aren't these people being given masks, being scanned or being disinfected? People are being brutally tortured by the police.

Food,How I stayed away from food delivery apps temptation?,65,e7zppb,Srivignesh3797,20,"People who always tend to order via food delivery apps like Swiggy,Zomato and Uber eats, just hear me out. 


I wasted so much money in these apps because I felt hungry and instead of looking for an alternative I just ordered either fancy food or cheap foods( Due to their attractive 50% offers). 



See the budget for alternatives like

Maggi (Rs 12)
Eggs (Rs 5-7)
Bread (Rs 30)
Tomato sauce large ( Rs 100)
Mayoneese large(Rs 110)
Chilly sauce large (Rs 110)
Rice Batter (Rs 40/kg) with Idly powder(Rs 10)[For South Indians]
Butter (Rs 50-150)
Milk (500 ml for Rs 25)
Peanut Butter (Rs 70)
Any Health mix/syrups
Frozen French Fries ( Rs 250/kg)




With these items you can make small dishes like 

Egg maggi
Bread omelette
Bread toast
Butter toast
Normal omelettes
Egg popcorn 


Although this may sound popular,it helps you to avoid ordering at late nights if you go for these alternatives or else you might end up spending Rs 150 for your cravings.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e7zppb/how_i_stayed_away_from_food_delivery_apps/

Food,"Shit getting real, y'all: a rant",608,fnlf3o,bodhisattwax,115,"I'm a doctor working in a large govt medical college and hospital.

To the best of my knowledge and assessment of the situation, we're about to get deluged in a wave of cases for which it is impossible to be adequately prepared. Many will die. The govt is trying, but whatever they arrange will never be enough for the general population to get off lightly. 

People panic buying food and medical supplies have created a vicious cycle so much so that I doubt if there will be enough meds for the frontline workers. This could potentially lead to more deaths in the healthcare workers, that could secondarily translate to a higher death rate in the patients.

People not taking quarantine seriously. Their actions today will kill many. Mostly their old, young, and sick family members, neighbours, or roommates.

In the meantime there's talk of having us work in makeshift corona wards from where we won't be able to return home. We'll probably stay on campus in recently emptied undergrad hostels. 

I don't mind working on campus and not coming home for weeks, maybe months. I don't mind dying too much either. ( I'm not super high-risk comorbidity-wise. I'm young. I run. But the stress is making me relapse into my smoking habit, and who knows what that might mean with this infection!) But the one thing that scares me shitless is that I don't know who will take care of my dogs at home. 

I hope I'm proved wrong in the coming weeks.

To negate the fatalism, if you're inside, avoiding ALL outside contact, you'll probably be able to delay infection to such time when we'll be better prepared to fight this thing with real world patient data, maybe new meds or even vaccines. Also death rates are generally low for young and fit patients.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fnlf3o/shit_getting_real_yall_a_rant/

And honestly, the lockdown is scaring me really bad. The prices of food items like potatoes, tomatoes, etc have risen significantly, or the supplies are almost finished. Many shops which sell basic groceries are closed and their owners say they are afraid if they will be arrested by the police even though groceries have been exempted. Even though I am from a middle class family, I know many low income families who are more paranoid about this situation. If people don't get to eat, they will die from hunger anyways.

I don't know about Economics, but is there a possibility that people might die more because of the lockdown rather than coronavirus? Many vegetables are absolutely finished in our local markets, and given that most vegetables, meat, etc come through local trains which are now non-operational, how will we get basic stuff like food? From what I know, poor people still have ration card to meet their requirements, and rich people, well, have their money to get through the system. What about most of us? 

Another thing is jobs. Due to these shutdowns, the businesses will face huge losses, jobs like hawkers, small shops, cottage industries, chaiwala, panwala, panipuriwala, etc will mostly go without any money. And if this lockdown is extended, which it most probably will, won't several million people just die due to lack of money and food?

Edit: I sometimes go on Libertarian sub (curiosity) and there someone said this that the population cannot sustain this and that this can be solved by just quarantining the old people and nothing else, i.e., no lockdown or travel ban or anything, just quarantining of old people because Covid 19 apparently doesn't harm young people.

Food,"Finance Basics – Share Market,Mutual fund, Insurance",73,fxb9zh,vikashred,34,"Lets learn something being at home. Any doubts you can message me.

If you are earning , you should know where to put your money , where people put money .

The real thing now is – why we need to invest. It’s because the value of everything, we buy, like food,clothes and land. Everything is rising and the one thing that is falling is, the value of money . It always fall and it will be same. That’s called inflation.

So, if you are just keeping money with you , it should be declining around 6 percent every year.

So, people invest, because all investment products ,if you see from past years are rising, anything like fixed deposit, gold ,mutual fund and share market.

We will discuss about share market, mutual fund and insurance below:

1. Share Market –
I just did a google search of a company called reliance , so it showed me the share price of it .

Just search in google : reliance share price

At that time of my search it showed 1353 is per share value. Market cap as you see in  is 8.58Trillion . So, if you divide mkt cap/value per share .You will know total how many shares are there. Share means a part of company. So, a company might be keep 51% share and giving the rest to public to buy, means they are selling ownership of company part to get money. So, that they can use that money may be to clear debt or to expand.

Company list these share in NSE/BSE (National Stock Exchange/Bombay Stock Exchange) .They offer it to people at a lesser price first known as IPO (Initial public Offering) . So, that you can subscribe for it through your broker, and the allotment is done.

The broker is register with NSE/BSE and you have to open a account with broker to buy or sell share. You can buy IPO or buy already listed share, so exchange allow to sell and buy share among individual, and shares are being hold in demat account. Demat account is basically a deposit account of share like you have bank account for money. You can open demat account with broker. And trading will be simple, there will be a buy button to buy and sell button to sell.

For example zerodha, they are India’s largest share broker -




They are discount brokers that means they charge very less on trading like least in india. 



2. Mutual Fund :
Mutual fund is about giving someone money and rights to manage your funds. So, they have different varities of funds and you can chose which one and which fund manager you would like to give money to.

They are of different types:

i. Equity Mutual fund:

Equity mutual fund buy shares , and are of different types like one investing in only small cap shares, one in large and other in mix of both.
There are index funds too, index means a instrument that sums up share market growth/decline. For example top 50 shares index is called as Nifty 50.
A index fund just track nifty 50, there is no such requirement of fund managers.

If someone managing fund with much harder effort, they charge more money for that, that’s called expense ratio. So, in nifty fund the expense ratio will be lowest.

ii. Debt fund:
Debt fund doesnot directly invest in shares , they invest in Government bonds , and company schemes, FD. So, this can be the safest.

iii. There are Hybrid funds. ,means a mix of both funds.

For a suggestion, there are rating agency, like Morning star , you can just invest in 5 star rated funds.

There are various direct mutual fund apps now available and they charge less expense ratio. Like the above link i provided for zerodha in share market section. Once you open account there, you use their coin.zerodha.com to trade mutual funds. It’s free and direct.
You can sign up and use the app to buy. It’s easy.

You may have heard about terms like lumpsum and SIP. Lumpsum is basically investing a amount at once. SIP means investing it on montly basis. So, what SIP does is ,it averages out your investment . It means, if on april , you bought at high price in may ,market fell and you still bought it by SIP ,so now your buy price is the average of both.



3. Insurance :
Insurance means transfer of risk to other . So,there are companies that you transfer risk, of your vehicle,health ,life basically financially.Accordingly it is classified into two types:

i. General insurance
General insurance relates to bike ,cars,etc. It is also of different types like

First party – first party means where both the insured person and the one with whom you had accident ,will be paid

Third party means only the one whom you had accident will be paid
These are compulsory in india.

ii. Life insurance

Life insurance are health insurance, term insurance, endowment plans .etc.

a. Health Insurance:
Health insurance means it covers your hospital expenses ,like you got some disease and the bill amount to lakhs of rupees ,it could drain out all your investment right. So if you have a health insurance,the company covers your expense

b. Term Insurance:
Term insurance means like you are the only earning member of your family ,after you die no one is there to support you . So, if you are giving a premium of 6000 per year ,after you die ,family will get a lumpsum of 60 lakh , its like that…

But only death benefit, else you won’t get money.

c. Endowment Plans:

If you are giving 50000 premium for 5 years here and getting 5 lakh after some 10 years, or depends on market.

Or if you die your nominee gets 5 lakh . Endowment for an example is like this.

You get maturity benefit and death benefit too, but premiums are high.

Basically, I believe you dont need endowment better invest in mutual fund and take term insurance , since endowment have huge charges . Health insurance is a must though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxb9zh/finance_basics_share_marketmutual_fund_insurance/

When there are many people who have been going without food for days on end. I love the way how some people are cribbing about being stuck in their homes with nothing to do. When there are some stuck without homes and nowhere to go. I love the way some elites are positing their fitness videos on the social media. When there are 1000s of migrants walking 100s of miles and this is not for exercise. I love the way people are posting their favorite recipe pictures on Instagram. When there are people sitting in the middle of the roads eating whatever is handed out to them out of kindness. I love the way people screamed and shouted at the airports when they were quarantined for a few hours.Wonder how many of them were herded together and sprayed with chemicals. There are two different Indias that we live in. One for the rich and one for the poor. Sometimes, we are unable to see beyond our life, our world, our zones of comfort. I know we don't do it deliberately, it's just that we don't realize what we are doing because we haven't seen the India of the poor. We have been shielded away from it. Forget about understanding, we can't even empathize with that India. The India of the poor. Hopefully, some day we will be able to look beyond these boundaries and recognize the other side of India, which is starving and fighting for their lives, even as we show discomfort of being locked down for a few days.

I want to start building a customer base in India first because I have worked with a lot of Indian children here in Australia and I always have a very positive relationship with them and their families. I also feel that our countries have a good friendship!

&#x200B;

Anyway, my product is digital and subscription based and I'm trying to work out the best way to promote it to parents and schools in India. I'll keep it as vague as possible so it doesn't come across like a promotion here, but I haven't been able to find reliable answers to some questions in my research:  


1. Is 400 Rs per month a reasonable price for an online subscription? I want to make it affordable for as many families as possible.
2. What are the most effective forms of advertising to reach parents? I'm on a limited budget and putting a lot of my time into my products, so I want to make sure I'm choosing the right advertising channels.

Thank you all so much for reading my post and any insight you can offer :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/em8hu3/advice_for_an_aussie_promoting_their_business_in/

Business/Finance,I can't get over Shaktikanta Das being appointed as RBI Governor,349,a5ewag,badger991,114,"I flaired this as Business/Finance. I guess it should be Politics and Non Politics as well.

IAS officers generally have no technical knowledge of the area they lead. Now from RR, we have gone down to the level of this guy who raped us with his demo execution.

Now, does this guy have any formal education in finance and economics? I couldn't find out. Or are we just following 'hard work > Harvard' bull shit.

What really worries me is that common people, or even educated people, or even the randia crowd don't seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be. We just don't have daily interaction with the RBI, so most don't know or care. RBI policies and actions affect everything. And I mean everything!

Business/Finance,"“India is not, as people keep calling it, an underdeveloped country, but rather, in the context of its history and cultural heritage, a highly developed one in an advanced state of decay.”",1,d931fb,howdy_rss,0,"*At the outset, I would like to state that this is not an essay that is critical of India or its people in any way. I am merely stating what I have observed and what I have concluded based on these observations. For this is the unvarnished truth. And India cannot palate the truth.*

My personal example on the reluctance to work hard: it is not just that, we lack ethics and morals too.

I know I am going to ruffle a few feathers as there are a lot of people from the US here. I am a grad student in the US(working towards my Ph.D), and most of friends here in the US are working in IT related jobs. What is worrying is that most of he these people got the jobs through consultants, who fake everything thing - from fake resumes to even fake phone interviews. I mean these are 22-23 YO with an experience of 8 years. I agree that the companies don't care much about contracts jobs, but the people who work should have a sense of responsibility. 80% of my undergrad friends are working in this manner. Their defence is that 'we spend so much money on education, it is only fair to earn and this is the easiest way we can earn good money.""

I never intrude into others' personal decisions, but this is really bothering me. We buy the newest Japanese and Germany cars in a flash, yet pirate songs and movies. We bitch about the state of politics, yet we behave the same way.. even worse in some cases that public servants.

We lack even the basic of ethics, we litter everywhere, drive like lunatics(we can't even give way to ambulances) and are pretty inconsiderate of others overall. More than my disdain for politics, I am pretty annoyed by the behavior normal people.

I am not saying that I am a perfect person, at least I am being honest to myself and even though I am being paid peanuts and under a lot of pressure from my parents, I am enjoying my student life. I am just sad that many people don't have and share good values. 

The Indian brain, is a phrase I have been hearing since I was a kid. Having been a PhD candidate, and seeing how India's best and brightest compared to the world's was an eye-opener for me. Sure my fellow Indians too won best paper awards and fellowships, but the average of originality & creativity was far higher in some of our Western counterparts.

The difference becomes even more stark, when one compares the contributions and achievements of Ashkenazi Jews (American or Israeli) to those of Indians. A persecuted minority of a few millions have contributed many orders more when compared to India's privileged academic contributors- say Tamil Brahmins. Of course it is worse when compared to Indians as a whole. What is striking is that the difference holds true even when comparing in a different field like business/ finance and contrasting with Gujrati/ Marwaris.

I am not exactly a self-hating Indian, and am moderately proud of Indian achievement when compared to some of our neighbors. But that is where it unfortunately ends.

I recently moved southwards in the Bay Area- from Palo Alto/ Mountain View to Santa Clara/ San Jose. I dropped out of my PhD and now run a moderately successful startup with some burn rate, and wanted to save some dough as we are in the process of raising money. And my new residence[1] almost wants me to start hating Indians. The Indian food is far better here, but most Indians seem to be of the variety you describe- consultancy or menial tech jobs. They are clannish, semi-dumb and almost seem to be proud of their mediocrity. FML & I can't wait to move to SF.

[1] for those who are not aware, these areas are far more Indian populated. Though I have seen seen something similar when I visited a friend in New Jersey.


Socrates, the father of Western thought, often spoke of a concept called Thumos. Thumos was very much a Greek concept. An abstract concept that held many meanings and translations. However, this concept has been lost to humanity and no literal translation exists in English. The essence of ‘Thumos’ can probably be summed up by the saying – “When making a decision, a man is faced with two choices. An easy path and a tough path. The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization"". And it is this tough road that every society must traverse to reach a peak. Taking the tougher road is an informed decision, for the natural impulse of every man is to take the easy path. He has to consciously take the tougher path, and avoid the easy. However, a man might unknowingly go down the easy path and end up where he did not want to be. Retracing your steps back to the tougher path is often a thankless and sometimes nigh on impossible task. Most men do not make it. India too, is at this cross roads today. And we might not make it.

It is indeed, ironic then, that I started this essay about the decline of ‘Indian civilization’ with a concept borrowed from the West. This is not to show that Indian philosophy has not reached the high levels of thought to have such a concept, but to merely show how far we have strayed from it. Make no such mistake. For the Vedas, the ultimate repository of Indian philosophy, were written long, long before Socrates’ ancestors even took up the plough and decided to grow the weeds they had observed in the wild and gave them nourishment. We had reached unimaginable highs and fallen from those highs, long before Socrates even had his first coherent thought. All Socrates did then, was re-discover what we had already known. We were superior in all respects. And it is in this very attitude, that lies the seed of our destruction. How many times have you heard your elders say – “Indian culture is the best. Anything associated with the West is bad!”. I hear it all the time. It is a constant din in our ears. Anything associated with the West is decadent and immoral and inferior. And Indian culture is superior to every other culture, past, present and future. Well then, superior in exactly what manner?? Few, if any, gave a concrete answer to this question. If they gave an answer at all.

The most common response to my question was anger and a rebuke for asking too many questions. How then are we superior? IF we are superior at all? Let us look around the world today and ask ourselves, “How many of the concepts, ideas, and objects that I use in my daily life on a day-to-day basis emerged from purely indigenous sources?” I asked myself this question many times, over and over again. The conclusion was the same everytime. None. To further clarify this point, let us look at the last invention of consequence which had a purely Oriental origin. Gunpowder. And this too was taken up and advanced by the West. If the Chinese invented Gunpowder, it was the West that developed the cannons that used them. Indeed, there is nothing that we can call truly our own except the past. And as all of us have seen, we revere the past. It is drummed into us in our schools, in our universities, in our families and at the dinner table. Indian culture always was and is, miles ahead of the decadent and corrupt influences of the West. It is not. This assertion is nothing but an inferiority complex. And an aversion to the truth.

It is important to realize that I am not saying that India or Indian culture is inferior or all that we developed as a civilization is a fabrication. It is not a fabrication. We were indeed a highly advanced civilization, and a highly cultured one at that. But we were, and not are. What we are now is a mish mash of cultures that does not know where it is headed.

How did we then fall so low? How did we, we who had reached highs that even now are only dreamt of, fall to the very depths from where these highs are unimaginable? It is tempting to blame the West, colonialism, British rule and all that. But the problem lies much deeper than that.

Every empire is built on one strength. One strength that sets it apart from the neighbours and allows it to grow while others around it stagnate. The Roman empire was built on the discipline of its Legions. Most armies of that time were little more than unruly mobs and this proverbial discipline of the Roman Legion made it a formidable attacking force. The British Empire was built on the strength of the trade links between Britain, a small insignificant island, and its vast territorial holdings in every corner of this planet. The dominant empire today is the USA. This empire is a little different. For its strength stems from its culture. Right from Hollywood, to sitcoms, our thought processes and ideas, to even what we eat and wear, it is the cultural power of the USA in full show. Every empire in history has had its one strength. And India too had a cultural empire similar to what the USA has today. A thousand years ago, students flocked from all over the world to study at Nalanda and Taxila. Just as they flock to the USA today. Great ideas were born in this crucible of free thought. Religions, philosophies and sciences were established by enlightened souls. Just as they are being established in the USA today. However, all empires must fall. The Roman empire fell when the discipline of its legions eroded. The British empire fell when its trade links could no longer be kept captive to serve them alone. The cultural empire of the USA is ripe to fall even as I write this. And the Indian empire has already fallen. A thousand years ago India was the USA of the age. Not any more. Today this cultural empire has eroded until all we have left is a kind of cultural hubris. And hubris, as we all know, is a fine quality. Often found in those who perish from it.

The strength of Indian civilization was always in its openness to new ideas. And a willingness to put in the hard work to further those ideas. Today however, we have neither the openness to new ideas, nor the will to work hard. Take for example the resistance to ‘Westernization’. Does it not speak of a reluctance to embrace new ideas and concepts? This hardening of opinions and closing of minds is prevalent not only in resisting outside influences and ‘preserving Indian culture’, but also in every detail of our lives. A teacher in India does not like it if his student questions him. For in that question, lies the seed of a new idea. And in that seed, lies the implication that the teacher may be wrong. And that is why we Indians do not like someone who asks too many questions, as I found out to my cost when I questioned India’s supposed cultural superiority.

**A far more dangerous symptom however, is our instinctive reluctance to work hard for what we want. Our instinctive impulse to take a shortcut. Our instinctive reflex to take the easy road. Here I come back to the opening statement of this essay. “The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization”. The tough road is often a tedious path. And in India, this road is often avoided in favour of the easy. Jugaad. It is nothing but a shortcut. And we as a nation, nay, as a civilization have become addicted to shortcuts. And hence we have fallen. Everything in India can be resolved by a shortcut. If you stand in a queue, there is always a tout who will be happy to help you jump the line for a fee. Instead of paying your taxes, it is far easier to just hide your income under your bed. Why wait for the light to change from red to green when there is no one crossing your path? Why be orderly when you can be disorderly and get away with it? Why work hard when you can steal from someone? Why be polite when you do not have to be? Why throw the garbage into the dustbin when someone is there to collect it from any spot in the city? I could go on and on. Everything in India has a shortcut. And this culture of taking shortcuts has struck root in the very mindset of our society. Every single thing is now a shortcut. Jugaad. Why take the tougher road to civilization? Why apply our minds when someone else can do it? It is easier to run away to the West than stay back and make this country worth living in. Why perform original research in India where you have to build your own apparatus, when you can just hop across the pond and perform that same research in the West, where that same apparatus can be bought off the shelf? Why? Why indeed? Because, it is the short cut. It is the easy path. And it shall lead us to barbarism. It is not an individual failing on the part of Indians. I will not blame any one person for this. It is a failing of our society. Indeed, it is a historical inevitability.**

Historical inevitability? Yes, our decline was inevitable. Every great civilization has declined when its culture of openness is replaced by closed minds and an aversion to questions. Look at Islam a thousand year ago and today. If at all anyone dares to interpret the quoran any way other than the accepted dogma, he is immediately met with a fatwa calling for his beheading. Western civilization has flourished and prospered precisely because it has cast off the yoke that is the Catholic church and allowed free thought. This freedom of thought does remain in India, but only in vestiges. And as we have already seen, it is being gradually eroded. It is historical inevitability. The point is further clarified by a study of entropy. Entropy, in layman’s terms, is a measure of the disorderliness in a system. In any spontaneous process, Entropy always increases. So if we consider human history to be a spontaneous process, interspersed by periods where Man has consciously tried to improve himself, it is not difficult to see how every rise is followed by a fall. As I have already stated, taking the tougher road is an informed decision, while the easy path comes spontaneously. Every civilization at some point, will abandon the long tough road, to take the short cut. And when a society starts taking shortcuts, it begins to decline. Every civilization has declined and so shall we.

And so we have declined. Our fall has only begun. And we shall keep falling, for a long, long time. Is there nothing that can be done? I do not know. The only thing that can be done is the administration of a shock treatment. A shock treatment that so drastically affects us that we will be forced to change for the better. The Black Death in the 14th century jolted Europe and gave rise to the Renaissance, which laid the foundation for the current dominance of Western civilization. Kemal Mustafa Ataturk’s radical measures of Westernization and his suppression of anything connected with the decadence of the Ottoman empire, gave rise to Modern Turkey. A nation that is a beacon of hope for the Muslim world. What kind of shock treatment can reverse the tide of India’s decline? I do not know. But the least we can do, is acknowledge that we have a problem. And when you see the problem and the scale of it, it will give you the shock treatment.

**TL;DR - We are in decline because our culture has lost its ability to question and innovate. We also prefer shortcuts. It is a historical inevitability and there is nothing we can do about it.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d931fb/india_is_not_as_people_keep_calling_it_an/

Business/Finance,"Delhi has not been given a single paisa from the ₹17,000 crore allocated to states. Here's why",382,fv9ifd,ringtring,64,"Hi there!

As is being reported by the news, approximately ₹17,000 crore has been allocated by the Centre to the States. Here is a representative news report: [""Centre grants Rs 17,000cr to states to tackle coronavirus crisis"", Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/centre-grants-rs-17000cr-to-states-to-tackle-coronavirus-crisis/articleshow/74975956.cms)

Of this ₹17,000 crore, ₹11,092 crore is the Union's contribution to the ""State Disaster Response Mitigation Funds (SDRMFs)"" and the rest is as a ""Revenue Deficit Grant"".

**Tl;dr:** The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state. The Finance Commission, a constitutional body, deals with financial relations between the Union Government and State Governments.

**Deep Dive:**

The XV-FC recommended creation of a new “disaster mitigation and response fund” 💰 at Union (NDRMF) and State levels (SDRMFs).

These new funds are distinct from the O.G. 😎 'National Disaster Response Fund' (NDRF) and SDRFs under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The NDRF and SRDFs are for ""*meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.*”

The NDRMF and SDRMF are for *""local level and community-based interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentally-friendly settlements and livelihood practices.*"" Large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the Union and State Governments.

*Note 1*: The difference here lies in the words **response** (NDRF/SDRF) and **mitigation** (NDRMF/SDRMF). Mitigation is pre-disaster. Mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.

*Note 2*: The NDRMF/SDRMF are statutory (legal) funds under the Disaster Management act, 2005 📝. Just like the NDRF and SDRFs.

*Note 3*: the Supreme Court 👨‍⚖ , in 2016, in an act of judicial activism (🙄) directed the creation of a National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) and state SDMFs. This was criticized a lot cause the court’s got no business in the executive 💼 working. This direction was not followed by most governments in India, and has remained a non-starter 🚫

Similarly, the approximately ₹6000 crore of Revenue-Deficit Grants are only for state governments.

**Edit and Update:** It seems that an inherent fact is being overlooked by people in the comments. The Union’s devolution under the XV-FC’s recommendations is a *constitutional obligation* and was meant to happen regardless of the Coronavirus epidemic. It also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the Government of Delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis. Some possible financing mechanisms that I’ve elaborated in the comments section are:

* Further Union contributions to Delhi’s SDRF (most effective)
* Making funds available from the Union Home Affairs Ministry (improbable given constrained budgets)
* Ways and Means Advances from RBI (30 day credit limit)
* Union spending through New Delhi Municipal Corporation (limited geographical spread)
* Municipal Bonds (underdeveloped and tight credit)
* Allocations from PMNRF and PM-CARES
* Donation drives from citizens and civil society",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fv9ifd/delhi_has_not_been_given_a_single_paisa_from_the/
Business/Finance,ITS LOCK ON for Indian Real Estate,4,fxmvof,DheerajKochhar,15,"  

***LOCK – ON means 'Disambiguation' which refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear.***

We never would’ve imagined a day when 1/3rd of world’s population would be in a lockdown. While the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today’s situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. 

This pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?

Businesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren’t performing. 

Remarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. 

A critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**

Studies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, “Out of Adversity comes Opportunity”. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. 

Real Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.

**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**

1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.

2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.

3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   
 (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.

4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.

5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.

While the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: 

 **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‘Home’ is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. 

**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector’s growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India’s GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector’s contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India’s GDP by 2025.

· **Real Estate – Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India’s Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**

· **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.

· **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. 

· **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.

· **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.

· **Long Term “Assured” Wealth Building Asset with “Predictable “ Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **“Predictable” Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an “Assured” Capital Appreciation in long term**, don’t be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company’s stock price or your bank’s health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own 

· **“Helps you Raise Money Quickly”** \- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!

· **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \- **“Wine and Real Estate improve with Age”** \- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!

· **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.

· **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.

· **Co-living market** size across India’s top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.

· **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.

· India’s improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.

**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**

Probably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why –**

1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.

2. **Low Demand – Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.

3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.

4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.

5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.

6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.

7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it’s time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.

**Final Thoughts:** 

**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**

\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, 

\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, 

\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly 

\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... 

Simply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process

**The Bottom Line**

**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**

Real estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor’s portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual’s cash flow and wealth.

**“BUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don’t WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**

Business/Finance,Here's my side of the story as a small businessman,26,fw7gcl,doomedbijnissman,6,"This is going to be long. I would really appreciate it if you can read this fully. Thank you for your attention in advance. 

I'm not sure what to flair this post as. I'm on a throwaway account that I may or may not continue using and I just want to share my side of the story while I sit here in loneliness watching random videos on Youtube just to get my mind off of things. And with no sign of sleep at all.

>About me & my partners

I'm a late 20s guy who quit his job two years ago and went ahead and jumped into the Indian startup ecosystem to start my business. I'm also a college dropout by choice so I don't have a graduate degree but I really loved the business WE were running. Me along with two of the bestest friends were my partners and I feel responsible for them. One of them quit his safe cushy job when I messaged him at 2am in the morning with my idea and the other one trusted me enough to fund this whole machine. I'm extremely lucky to have these people in my life and I acknowledge that.

>Our Business - What we do

Our business isn't one of those apps or tech related business. We're more into the supply chain and making product sourcing and fulfillment for people in the ecommerce sphere easy. Think of it in a way that I'm sourcing and exporting products that my clients sell on their ecom sites. I loved this because this is something that solved a problem for my own hobby turning it into a full-fledged business and it was also helping me create a legit machine with a brand name that also helped me capture clients.

>How has the lockdown affected my business?

Being a new business we were ALMOST breakeven. Most of the money we were losing was because of bad decisions and mistakes but everyday we were losing less. Also had a bunch of profitable days and weeks which helped us not invest more from our own pockets into the business. We had created a cycle where the money that came in helped us with all the costs.

Me along with the partner who had invested money into the business were not taking out salaries (reason why I said almost breakeven) and I was making sure that the third partner got paid because he left his good job and to assure his family members - remember, we're all in our late 20s. We had also hired some help to help us in the office and with the vendors that we were dealing with. Basically the plan was to spend only when absolutely necessary and while doing it this way we also made sure that we had a life outside of work.

This worked smoothly with some hitches of course.

In January when I read about the first covid-19 case in India, I was scared. Things got bad real soon around the world. With every passing day I was worried more and more about what I was going to do in case our country went into a complete lockdown. I checked and tried to do some analysis in order to see if we can still work it if we do go into the lockdown.

But the fact of the matter is that my business heavily depends on vendors and shipping providers and the latter is out of my control and reach. The main part of this whole thing was shipping which I had taken so much pain to setup.

One thing I learned while doing all this is that there's a reason why India with such manpower and about mediocre infra in our industry isn't able to fulfill even a fraction of the demand. It's because the vendors are lazy. Even if you promise to pay them above the market rate, make payments on time and even help them financially to source the raw materials, they are not willing to work for it. And I'm not talking about overtime or anything.. Just their normal work cycle. They are not serious about it at all.

I had multiple vendors but only one of them worked properly and listened to me when there was an urgency in the order we were giving them. We had this second vendor who just wasn't serious about the work and we were giving them loads of work. Within a month I was their biggest client and they did work properly for the first two months but after that it all went to shit. I couldn't change my vendor because that's a long process of renegotiating and setting everything up which I couldn't do in my volumes which were high.

I wrote all this because when my city got the first few Covid-19 cases, I started urging them to get my work done as soon as possible. We were given assurances, promises, we paid in advance but it all went to shit because now I have an inventory of products that is ready to go but I cannot send them due to the state borders being closed. My shipping company is not able to function and all these need to be sent out of India.

I'm now in a sea of uncertainty where I have to pay my bills, pay my office rent, pay salaries with whatever I have in the business account right now.

>The finances

I'm not even worried about the money, I'm worried about the inventory I have, I'm worried about the payment disputes I need to deal with because these are all orders to be sent outside India. For every payment dispute I lose, I lose $15 extra. The money for the customer acquisition cost is already paid for. The money for the raw materials are to be paid and I'm refunding customers everyday. Losing that customer acquisition amount along with any margin that I might have earned.

>What do I mean exactly? 

Now, I'm all for Life>Money but as a small businessman who has been thinking, living, breathing his business all the time for months and years, I'm going insane. I'm having panic attacks, I don't know what I will do next. I used to have a plan for everything, now I don't. I'm not able to let this go and this pain is almost physical now. My head hurts all the time, I sleep for a few hours and when I wake up my eyes are still red and they feel as if they're burning.

I'm also sure that there are businesses out there that are into deeper shit than I am but that in my own opinion shouldn't be a comfort for me. I'm not sadistic.

I have no savings, my company is running out of money, there are people who need to be paid, employees to pay and a partner who invested with trust and is now seeing the money disappear into thin air daily - he's a kind soul and hasn't said a single word for it yet.

But I feel responsible and I'm not able to calm down. Anxiety is on its peak for me right now and I have no plans to save us from this.

I come to this sub daily and I actively participate in discussions and disses but I haven't seen anything about small business people here and just wanted to tell my side of the story.

I'm scared guys, I'm not even religious and can just hope that the govt. probably is thinking of exporters in this scenario to maybe help us in this situation.

I'm wishing you all good health and please stay inside.

I'm going to try and sleep now. Thank you for reading this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fw7gcl/heres_my_side_of_the_story_as_a_small_businessman/

Business/Finance,Actuarial student looking for some career advice.,14,fzsng3,Roastedchicken69,4,"Hey there internet people!

I posted this in r/Indian_Academia but didn't get any responses. Posting here for better visibility. 

Sorry for a long post but I would really appreciate some career guidance.

I'm gonna give you a brief background of my situation. I graduated in 2016 with a BSc in Statistics, Mathematics and Economics (from Christ University Bangalore if it matters). During second year of college I really got into skateboarding and was desperately trying to make it work as a career option. I worked with Holystoked collective (they are the pioneers of skateboarding scene in India), built a skatepark in Bangalore with them and life was amazing. But towards the end of my undergrad I injured my knee pretty bad and things went downhill from there. One injury led to another and before I could realize, I had a knee issue, back pain, hip pain and what not. I was in poor health and it eventually took toll on my mental health. Long story short I pretty much wasted a little over one year. In 2017 I got my shit together and wrote the entrance test for writing actuarial exams. I started writing actuarial exams in 2018 and cleared 4 Core Technical exams by the end of 2019. I was going to write two more exams this April but our exams got cancelled due to COVID 19 pandemic.

Now, I've been looking for an actuarial job for some time now and realized that its really really hard to get a job without contacts or college placements. I have also been learning data sciece and machine learning with python, as I already have a solid maths and statistics foundation, so as to get a data science or data analyst job and then perhaps switch to actuarial eventually. But now with an almost inevitable economic recession looming over our heads, I'm a little worried about my career.

Could someone please guide me? Where do I go from here? Should I keep looking for jobs? Even if I do find a job I don't expect it to be more than 5LPA. Or should I go for higher education? Would an MBA in Finance or Business Analytics make sense?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzsng3/actuarial_student_looking_for_some_career_advice/
Business/Finance,Oil slump? India will rather play dumb by raising prices,78,fiolca,decipherseattle,23,"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/government-raises-excise-duty-on-petrol-diesel-by-rs-3-per-litre-2194742?pfrom=home-topstories

The taxes on Petrol and Diesel have grown by over 100% in the tenure of Modi government. While the other big economies are trying to ensure that they do not go in economic slump by easing their monetary policy, India is busy dampening consumer confidence.

This news closely follows another one where the Modi government fired Urjit PATEL for not financing 1.56L crores worth of government expenditure.

The markets are reeling heavily downwards under pressure due to C scare, and it is very likely that the investors will pull out their investments from higher risk based emerging economies. In a looming recession, the growth can flee and the institutional investors may pull out in hoards.

The Indian banks are failing and the modi government is further dampening the consumer confidence by raising taxes on staple like Petrol. The recent drop in oil prices was perfect opportunity for the government to announce a reduction. 

In the times needing economic rescue via freer monetary measures , the government has chosen to play out a decision lacking economic prudence.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fiolca/oil_slump_india_will_rather_play_dumb_by_raising/

So my question is how good is ISBF, Delhi? Apparently, it's affiliated with University of London, with ""academic direction"" from London School of Economics. I'm not too sure about this as this is literally the first time I'm hearing about this institution (pardon my ignorance). I couldn't find much about it on other websites, either. I'm looking at a BBA (or a BSc in Business & Management in ISBF's case) from either Symbiosis, Pune or NMIMS, Mumbai. 

I have the option to go abroad, but I honestly doubt if it's worth spending 80L+ when I could get a similar degree in about 10L. Of course, the knowledge and exposure I'd get would be tremendous and I'd get a better pay as a fresher, but I doubt it's worth the extra $$$.

Business/Finance,Lives & livelihoods in India,6,fzfkko,Nawin1993,1,"Lives and livelihoods

Context:

The Prime Minister, while announcing the lockdown had to decide between saving lives and ensuring livelihoods. He rightly privileged the former over the latter then. As India nears the end of the lockdown period, the serious damage to the economy and livelihoods is beginning to make itself apparent. The editorial talks about various measures to manage the unprecedented crisis on the economic front.  

Issues:

There is tremendous pressure from industry bodies to opt for a nuanced policy that will help economic activity to restart.
They fear a collapse if activity is stopped for another fortnight.
Lives could be lost to hunger and livelihoods sacrificed in the lockdown.
Way ahead:

One way to sidestep this existential dilemma is by bringing on a second round of an economic relief package that goes well beyond the first both in terms of the financial commitment and the spread. 
The ₹1.7-lakh crore package announced by Finance Minister was a good start but barely accounted for 1% of GDP. India should spend at least 5% of GDP for now — about ₹10-lakh crore. 
The cash transfers to the poor should be hiked to at least ₹3,000 a month for the next three months. This should be in addition to free rations and cooking gas, as was announced earlier.
Out-of-the-box ideas for delivering support and also for raising the required funds might be required. 
The government should let go off fiscal conservatism and go all out to spend and support the economy. Economists are unanimous that there is little option now but to print money and spend (what the developed countries are doing).
In the harvest season, farmers need logistical support for moving their produce to markets.
Lenders, including NBFCs, should be granted freedom to reschedule their loan accounts so that borrowers are not under pressure to repay for fear of turning delinquent. 
A credit guarantee fund that will support non-delinquent borrowers for the next six months will be a good option. 
Such a fund can be financed through a domestic bond offering. 
The bankruptcy code should be suspended for the next six months, at least for MSMEs. 
A GST holiday for the next three months would be a good option.
The loss of revenue will be ₹3-lakh crore at worst, but in reality will be much lower than that because economic activity is at a standstill now. 
Such a move will ease cash flows for business and also obviate the need for statutory compliances at a time when the focus will have to be on getting businesses back on track. 


Conclusion:

The crisis now is without precedent and the solutions must not be conservative. Generous support from the government, and quickly delivered, is the need of the hour.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fzfkko/lives_livelihoods_in_india/

### 1) SARS-­CoV-­2 

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer­reviewed, open­access journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS­-CoV-­2, the virus causing the COVID-­19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-­2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

### 2) G20 Meeting in Saudi Arabia

* Recently, the ministers and central bankers from the world’s largest economies participated in the G20 meeting held in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia).
* It was presided by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the first Arab nation to hold the G20 presidency.
* The 2020 G20 Presidency will focus discussions, forums, working groups and Ministerial Meetings under the theme of “Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All”.

#### Key Points

* Global Economy:
   * The global economic growth remains slow and downside risks due to the geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty.
   * Though the economic growth is expected to increase in 2020 and 2021 due to loose monetary policy and an easing of trade tensions.
* IMF’ Views at the Meeting:
   * It projects a “V-shaped, rapid recovery” for the global economy, but it warns about the uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19).
   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

* The E-Courts Project was conceptualized based on the ""National Policy and Action Plan for Implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the Indian Judiciary - 2005"" submitted by the e-Committee of the Supreme Court of India (set up in 2004).
* The main objectives of the e-Court Project are as follows:
   * To provide efficient & time-bound citizen-centric service delivery.
   * To develop, install & implement decision support systems in courts.
   * To automate the processes to provide transparency of Information access to its stakeholders.
   * To enhance judicial productivity both qualitatively & quantitatively, to make the justice delivery system affordable, accessible, cost-effective & transparent.
* The e-Courts National portal (ecourts.gov.in) was launched in 2013. This provides Case Status, daily Case-list, Cases Filed and Cases Registered through the Case information System (CIS) Software.
* The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is a part of the e-Courts Integrated Mission Mode Project. It was launched in 2015. The aim is to track judicial performance across different courts in the country.
   * The NJDG is working as a National data warehouse for case data including the orders/judgments for Courts across the country.
   * NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage & reduce pendency of cases.
   * It also helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delay and arrears in the system, facilitate better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, facilitate better resource management.
   * NJDG has specifically helped India improve its ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report.

### 4) Craspedotropis Gretathunbergae

A group of scientists has recently discovered a new species of land snail in Brunei.

* The new species reside in tropical rainforests and are sensitive to drought and extreme temperatures (which have become more frequent due to climate change).
* Hence as an honor to Swedish Climate Change activist Greta Thunberg, who has been making efforts to raise awareness about climate change, the new snail species was named Craspedotropis Gretathunbergae.
* Recently, a tiny species of beetle was also named after her as Nelloptodes Greta.
* In 2018, a new species of beetle (Grouvellinus Leonardodicaprioi) was named after the actor Leonardo DiCaprio (an American actor, producer, and environmentalist).

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

### 7) World’s largest cavefish discovered in Meghalaya

A team of experts from the UK, Switzerland, and India have discovered the world’s largest species of cavefish in Meghalaya’s Jaintia Hills.

#### About

* The cavefish, similar in anatomy to an endangered mahseer species, is around one and a half feet in length and was found inside a remote cave in Jaintia Hills.
* The fish has no eyes and is white due to a lack of melanin pigmentation.
* As they live in a nutrient-limited environment most of these species are small.

### 8) Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* The State Government of Arunachal Pradesh intends to build a highway through the 862 sq km Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) in East Kameng district.
* The Government had in the past built a highway through the Namdapha National Park.

#### Key Points

* The project is named the East-West Industrial Corridor which is a proposed elevated corridor at the tiger reserve, to be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs.2,550 crore.
* The highway aims to connect Bhairabhunda in West Kameng district and Myanmar in Changlang district along Arunachal Pradesh’s border with Assam.
* The argument over an elevated corridor at the PTR was that it can ensure the free movement of wild animals.
* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state’s foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.
* The vegetation is predominantly tropical semi-evergreen forest.
* What makes PTR special are the brilliant efforts of the Forest Department and local communities like that of the Nyishi Tribe who inhabit the area around the park to protect the wildlife here.

Business/Finance,What the fuck is modi doing ?,4,fmob0d,UsualEducation,5,"What the fuck is modi doing ? He's unfit to be leader of this country. 

He always touts his horns when representing india by elevating it as world largest democracy. 

Now what ? World's largest democracy' economy is probably will be in ruins by the time this is all over. 

As far as I have gathered:- 

He's not really giving people any financial support. He only urged people to not leave the disadvantaged behind. I understand that. But dude, even people who will be paying them will have no income stream left. 

So what maybe you pay your employees. Will your landlord be generous enough to forget your monthly payments. Maybe he is, but now even he has to pay property tax without any income stream.

He's not providing tax cuts or financing salaries of people. 

Now when this shit storm is all over he doesn't even have any policies if place if he decides a full lockdown. Many business will become bankrupt. Many company will be dissolved. It will be a period of unstable financial turmoil. Many life's will be ruined and that fucker will still not be accountable for all his action ( like erection of 3000 crore statue ) or rather his inaction. 

This could very well lead to another event like Great Depression. Without support from government many people will be laid off and many will become bankrupt. Industrial activities will be delayed as demands will be greatly reduced due to depletion of people's cash reserves.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fmob0d/what_the_fuck_is_modi_doing/

You can make prediction about absolutely anything and you do not necessarily have to justify them. Obviously you have to keep them India-centric.

Some examples at the top of mind: escalation in war, a particular party coming to power in your state, some criminal getting acquitted/found guilty, a bollywood movie breaking records, Sensex levels, exchange rate

Business/Finance,Help! How do I stop my dad from squandering away his savings?,122,dwnioc,Vibgyor_5,43,"**Background:**


My dad retired 2 years back from a government organization where he did not have a pension scheme. He has saved 25L or so over the years to sustain for himself. 

He has had thoughts for opening a playschool because he wanted to do something in education. Noble idea? Yes. But he does not have any background in education/teaching etc. and understanding how schools are run. More importantly, the problem is that my dad...unfortunately, lacks business acumen and is very trusting of people. 

He tried to have a franchise with one company, signed a contract, and lost 1L there that the company refused to return. This was done without much consultation with me (where I could have at least tried to look into this and prevent it) Next, he aligned with another school and took their franchise and has spent 8L till date, running at a significant loss. 

I also have 2 elder brothers but they are not very supportive in terms of finance or else. We all are living in different cities (they in Mumbai, I am in Delhi, parents are in UP) My sister-in-law did step in as school coordinator initially but found a teaching gig (right step imo) elsewhere soonafter. Year to date, there are only 5 children with 2 teachers who mostly sit whole day. My dad acts as school coordinator. 


**Current situation:**

Lately, he argues that he will open school in own home by using the part of the building that is being rented out. (School is being run in a rented out building) He also expects me to support him financially despite my multitude of warnings, ignoring number of suggestions I made etc. To put cherry on the cake, I came across a profile of an experienced School coordinator which I suggested to my dad so that she can lead this but he rejected it because she was Muslim. (which wasn't something I expected of my dad...but that's another story)

My concern stems from the fact that this is a deep hole my dad is sinking himself into in terms of expenses. This is worrying for me because I have started job just 2 years back and expect it'd be at least 3-4 years before I am in a position where I can help him out a bit. Additionally, the current tenant has has are pretty good + it offers a recurring cashflow in terms of his savings.

My take on this is that if he wants to focus on education, why not simply open a scholarship scheme or suppport some decent schools for underpriviliged kids? While there is no upside to this financially, the amount can be fixed and it is far better use of the money IMO.

Business/Finance,"Anti-national, who me? Anti-""Hindu-Nation""-al, certainly!",61,ee6xey,wricker,28,"**The goal of** ***Hindutva*** **is the religious conversion of India.**

Call me a pessimist, but I believe that the BJP is actually benefiting from the CAA+NRC protests. Call me paranoid, but I think that Modi and Shah will use the chaos in the nation to justify even more fascist measures.

Fascism relies on the dichotomy of ‘us and them’. ‘We’, the caste Hindus, led by a strong patriarch, versus the Muslims (who are really Pakistani infiltrators and/or terrorists; dirty, conniving sub-humans who want to destroy Hindustan) and the Christians (a lot of them Dalits, who ‘belong’ to Hindus but are taking away Hindu college seats and jobs, leading the country to shit, while they should be cleaning our shit).

This is *Hindutva*: hatred and ignorance masquerading as a political philosophy. Not socialism, social democracy, liberalism or conservatism, but hate. These philosophies, whatever their merits or demerits may be, take effort and dedication and love of the subject to study. Hindutva requires only hate. Forget Hindu texts, they don’t even have to study the Constitution. Doing so takes effort, you see. Hating and lynching is far easier.

This is why saffron-toting goons stop Muslims (and in [one unforgettable instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJfvp59Kufs), Kanhaiya Kumar) and force them to chant “Jai Shree Ram”; this is why Amit Shah dehumanizes Bangladeshi migrants to “termites”; why Narendra Modi says the protesters can be recognized from their clothes.

Why abrogation of Article 370, why the blackout and human rights violations in Kashmir, why the abnormal Modia focus on Pakistan, why Ram Mandir, why NRC, why CAA? The message is clear: Muslims are not Indians, and they cannot stay. India is a Hindu Rashtra.

*But what about our Preamble? What happened to ‘sovereign socialist secular democratic republic’? What of Article 14, Article 15? Our Fundamental Rights?*

Okay, maybe we aren’t ‘socialist’ or ‘secular’ anymore. But from a young age we have been reading and hearing these words. “Unity in diversity.” “United we stand, divided we fall.” “India is the world’s largest democracy.” “We are a secular country.” “Indians are known for their hospitality.”

From our youth, the Idea of India is ingrained in us. And Hindutva -- hatred, really -- has attacked the very core of Indian-ness.

The fight today is not because we don’t want persecuted religious minorities to seek haven in India. That’s absurd. We are a very hospitable people.

We fight because 14 percent of Indians face religious persecution in their own country. We fight because the economy is going down and hatred is on the rise, and the ruling party has done nothing to fix either. Instead they are trying to alienate crores of Indians, making detention centres where at least [25 people have already died](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/25-declared-foreigners-died-in-assam-detention-centre-750773.html) (as of 31 Jul ’19), and set the police and armed forces on peaceful protesters leading to the death of at least 20 people (as of 22 Dec ’19). Their fantasy project will cost us [lakhs of crores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlTKGz-TvJk) (to pay for NRC, CAA and detention centres). And if 20 people have died in the 18 initial days of the protests, we may be looking at hundreds, or even thousands of deaths within the next year alone.

If you think what BJP is doing is for the good of the nation, then we disagree on the definition of ‘good’.

And we certainly disagree on the definition of a ‘nation’. Hindu Rashtra and Hindu nationalism violate the Constitution. And turning India into a theocracy like Iran is what Modi and Shah and the Sangh Parivar machinery wants to do. Can Modi say under oath that he does not want to convert India into Hindu Rashtra? Can the bhakts say so?

&#x200B;

**Fascism creates the conditions through which it can justify its own fascist policies.**

Religious conversion of India will require imposing tighter restrictions, and more fascist policies. And how does one justify the use of fascist policies?

An enemy.

While the protests have been going on, Indian and Pakistani firing across the border has increased (which was on the rise since the abrogation of 370). On [18 Dec](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/situation-along-loc-can-escalate-any-time-army-chief-bipin-rawat/articleshow/72872824.cms), Bipin Rawat issued a very provocative statement about “escalatory matrix”. On [19 Dec](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/letter-pakistan-india-placing-missiles-kashmir-191219101643065.html), the Pakistani Foreign Minister wrote to UN alleging India had positioned missile-launchers in Kashmir, and the Indian government refused to comment (*a* *great way to defuse tensions /s*). Then Imran Khan on [Dec 21](https://www.dawn.com/news/1523532/pakistan-will-give-befitting-response-if-india-undertakes-false-flag-operation-pm-imran) replied with such terms as “bloodbath” and “false flag operations”. And today ([22 Dec](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pakistan-violates-ceasefire-along-loc-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-rajouri-poonch/article30371876.ece)) morning there were major firing and shelling from both sides on multiple places: Pakistan [reports](https://thesouthern.com/news/world/pakistan-says-indian-shooting-kills-in-kashmir/article_e76017d4-78f9-5481-92c9-1a147f352159.html) three civilians killed with a dozen homes damaged, while India says our soldiers “retaliated effectively”.

Funnily enough, no talk of surgical strikes is floating around. Perhaps this time they do not serve Modi Ji’s purpose. Or perhaps there are no clouds in the sky? In any case, this time the purpose will perhaps be served by sacrificing our soldiers in a direct conflict. Against the Muslim-majority Pakistan.

And oh, the protesters who can be recognized by their clothes? Clearly they are Pakistani infiltrators and terrorists. The protesting students? *Tukde-tukde* gang. The professors, academicians and journalists? Anti-nationals and urban Naxals. International critics? They carry the ""white man's burden"" if they're white, and are inconsequential if they're of any other colour.

Fascism, elected democratically, will destroy democracy. Say your final “good morning” on WhatsApp.

In Nazi Germany, Jews were portrayed as dirty ‘rats’ (well, at least a mammal, not insects) who were lazy, stupid and cunning and stole the hard-working Germans’ jobs (see the contradictions?). In fact, Jews were on average well-educated and held important positions and ran businesses due to their hard work. Then through fascist policies, inch-by-inch, Nazis made the conditions unbearable for Jews, so that they really had to lose their jobs, their homes, had to live in squalor, and some started committing petty crimes to feed themselves. “See!” said the Nazis, “we told you they were cunning criminal rats!”

Thus they justified the Holocaust.

Justifying a holocaust is not that hard. We Indians are living that process of justification right now. Not so long ago, Islamophobia was frowned upon or at least hidden, and “anti-nationals” and “urban Naxals” were merely juvenile name-calling to be shrugged off (not so much for Gauri Lankesh). By creating the conditions, Modi is making these words into serious accusations, which will help him bring into effect more fascist policies, and then the Constitution will be re-written. The *ghar wapsi* of India will be complete.

We can at least make the process of justifying the holocaust hard for him. By calling out fake news, boycotting Modia, boycotting companies which support and finance BJP (you-know-who), and above all, by using non-violent means of protest. Y’know, protesting Indian-style.

Ever since BJP has come to power, there has been systemic destruction of the nation's education system.

However, at the same time it is destroying the federal character of Indian education and is attempting to control the entire sector from the Centre, as part of the designs to push the Hindutva agenda. This is reflected in appointing RSS personnel in key administrative bodies, rewriting of history, abrupt and irrational changes in syllabi, propagation of pseudoscience, so on and so forth.

Business/Finance,"The impact of GST on invoicing, and thus on revenue and profit of organizations operating in India - exploring one of the factors impacting the economy right now",78,d4mq0p,zaplinaki,46,"tl;dr

Because of GST, organizations have to bill the clients in each state that is involved because of GST norms. If before GST this required one bill, it now means multiple bills depending on the number of states involved. It could go as high 36 bills (29 states + 7 union territories.) This means that if pre-GST X effort was required to make 100 rupees, it now requires n\*X effort (1 to 36) to make 100 rupees. Meaning that the work required to make the same amount of money has increased by 100% to 3500% 

This has impacted the profit of the companies and thus the economy. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Before I begin, I am not an expert on taxation - I am a business guy working in B2B sales for an Indian MNC. My 3.5 year career has been largely post-GST, but I have experienced the pre-GST era as well. I constantly have to deal with GST and its numerous requirements.

My objective is to highlight a major roadblock that I and many other business folks have encountered due to GST, and I feel that this aspect is playing a big role in the slowdown and at the same time has been left largely unexplored till now because of the grassroot nature of the problem. The people higher up don't encounter this directly and anyone who doesn't encounter this wouldn't understand the gravity of the problem aka reporters, etc. Again to reiterate, I am not trying to debate the improvements over VAT and I am merely here to highlight a side of GST which is hindering my revenue and my profit, thus my business.

&#x200B;

Let's start with some basic concepts first:

/**1) Invoicing:** The act of giving a 'bill' for the products or services utilized by a customer. For most people, this is a simple receipt at the end of a meal for instance, or at the checkout counter of a clothing store for the clothes you've purchased, or a bill given by a cleaning service for cleaning their homes.

But for an organization, an invoice is the means to collect money from a client. Anything that is sold to a client will generate an invoice for the products delivered/services rendered. The invoice will also have the tax details (GST number, billing address, registered address, shipping address, list of items that need to be paid for, applicable tax - CGST, IGST, SGST, payment due date, and authorized signatures)

**An invoice is a means to collect cash from the client. Without a proper invoice, cash cannot be collected. This is where the problem starts. Since not having a 'proper invoice' gives a lot of ground to the client to delay the payment.**

&#x200B;

/**2) The process of Invoicing / Invoicing function in an organization:** Once the product is delivered or the services rendered, or sometimes before they are delivered, invoicing is triggered, meaning that a 'bill' is generated and the money has to be collected from the client. This is usually done through an ERP like SAP or Oracle. The invoice then reaches the collections department, where the collection manager submits the invoice to the client for verification and payment. **The collection managers are the front line people tasked with bringing money into the organization.** They are one of the most important people for running the business because their performance impacts the cash flow of the organization.

They are normally tagged to accounts, aka clients. One collection manager could be handling anywhere from one client to thousands, depending on the nature and size of their clients.

**Once the client verifies the invoice, the money is transferred to the selling organization and it becomes revenue and subsequently profit for them.**

**If the client holds the invoice for any reason, then it becomes lost revenue or a bad debt (loss) for the selling organization.** The longer the client holds this money, the lesser the value that money holds due to the concept of time-value of money. 100 rupees today is considered as more money than 100 rupees one month from now due to the time-value of money. Thus a delayed payment impacts the profitability of the organization.

**/3) GST for the services industry:** GST dictates that the invoicing for services will be done in the state where the services have been delivered. **I will explain this concept in detail as this is the crux of the problem.** To start off, I will outline a simple sale and how that sale would translate into the pre-GST and post-GST era:

**Problem Statement:** Assume that Tata Motors intend to buy 5000 chairs for their offices from Pepperfry for 50 lakh rupees. Tata Motors also wants Pepperfry to install the chairs in their offices (5 lakh rupees), and then provide 5 years warranty including a checkup every year to determine the life of the chair, and any repairs required (15 lakh rupees.) Tata Motors wants the chairs to be delivered to 50 offices in india, across 20 different states. This is a mix of products (chairs) & services (installation and maintenance.) The total bill is for 70 lakh rupees -

5000 Chairs - INR 50 Lakhs

Installation of Chairs in 50 Offices across 20 states - INR 5 Lakhs

Maintenance of Chairs for 5 years - INR 15 Lakhs

Pepperfry sales executives will take the purchase order from Tata Motors and put the order into their system. The input of the purcahse order will trigger three functions:

a) Delivery of the products & services

b) Invoicing and payment for the order

c) Post-Sale service & maintenance

**Pre-GST Invoicing:**

Before GST came into the picture, the above bill would be generated by Pepperfry as a single bill centrally ie they would generate a bill for 70 lakhs, with the extra relevant VAT and the tax details of the two organizations. This would be on **ONE SINGLE BILL** for the entire deal, irrespective of state, city, etc. They would just give Tata Motors one single piece of paper saying that they are owed 70 lakhs with the due date for the payment.

Manoj who is Pepperfrys collection manager for Tata Motors will submit this single invoice at the Tata Motors office where it will be checked by the Tata Motors procurement and finance teams, and if there is nothing wrong with the invoice, the payment will be cleared off by the due date.

**Again the point to focus on here is that only ONE INVOICE is needed for the delivery of the chairs and services to the entire country. Manoj has to submit just one invoice, follow up on invoice, and collect the payment on one invoice. Tata Motors teams have to verify one invoice, and process the payment on one invoice. Only one tax number and billing address is needed on the invoice because it is being done CENTRALLY.**

If there is something wrong with the invoice, Manoj has to correct only one invoice and resubmit it to Tata Motors.

&#x200B;

**Post-GST Invoicing:**

Like I mentioned before, GST dictates that the invoicing be done in the state where the services have been delivered ie separate GST filing for all states. Explaining further this means that a separate invoice has to be generated for each state that is involved in the transaction. If this one state involved, one invoice. If two states are involved, then two invoices. If five states are involved, then five invoices. And in this case since twenty states are involved, twenty invoices.

&#x200B;

The values of the invoices are split in direct proportion to the usage. If 100 rs is the total bill value, in three states, Maharashtra, UP & Kerala with 60:30:10 usage, then the bills will be:

Maharashtra - 60

UP - 30

Kerala - 10

So in a sense it is a separate company in each state in terms of GST.

**Moving on to the implication in the Tata Motors - Pepperfry transaction:**

Since the chairs have to be delivered in 20 states, Tata Motors & Pepperfry will have to have a registered office in all twenty states along with a GST number for each state. Tata Motors will have to issue 20 purchase orders in the proportionate value to Pepperfry ie 70 lakhs split proportionally into 20 states. The sales executive will enter twenty purchase orders into the system. Then deliveries will be triggered for 20 states and 20 different invoices will be handed over to Manoj after generation.

Manoj will submit 20 invoices to Pepperfry, whose procurement department will then verify 20 invoices, give it to finance to verify and then initiate 20 payments. Then 20 payments will be received by Tata Motors (with 20 banking transaction ID's) and Manoj will verify the 20 payments and close the transaction for now. ***This is the ideal scenario.***

As you might have been able to tell, the effort required by everyone involved in the deal has gone up 20 times. This effort required will be the same as before if there is only one state involved on the buying side, ie Maharastra selling to Maharashtra. It'll be twice the effort if two states are involved on the buying side, ie Maharashtra selling to UP & Kerala. **It has a possibility of going upto 36 time the effort required previously for the same amount of money since there are 29 states and 7 Union Territories. Yes Union Territories are treated separately as well.**

&#x200B;

**The impact from this is:**

**/1) Efficiency/Effort:** Pepperfry is still going to make 70 lakhs on the deal but the effort required will be twenty times that of before because Tata Motors will give 20 purchase orders on which 20 invoices will be generated. The time taken to process these invoices is the same because their value does not impact the time taken to collect the money on them. This is because each invoice will be the same template, its just that their  values will be different. Example:

Maharashtra

Chairs - INR 5 Lakhs

Installation - INR 50K

Support - INR 1.5 Lakhs

Kerala

Chairs - INR 3 Lakhs

Installation - INR 30K

Support - INR 90K

UP

Chairs - INR 10 Lakhs

Installation - INR 1 Lakh

Support - INR 3 Lakhs

The total money being collected is the same as before but the sales executive, Manoj, the procurement guy & the finance guy have to do 20 times the work for it with no other added value.

Their efficiency in this scenario has gone down to 5% but it can arguably go down to 2.7% if all states and union territories are involved, although this is a rare case.

Also like I said that this is the ideal scenario. It doesn't always go this smoothly. Some of the challenges encountered are:

a) Incorrect proportions of purchase orders / invoices: Someone made a mistake if 10 needed to be allocated to UP, then they've allocated 11 or 15. The process has to be repeated again after finding the fault.

b) Incorrect GST on PO / invoice: Suppose a particular invoice has the wrong GST, it means that it can't be processed on incorrect tax information, which means that that money can't be collected on that invoice. Before GST there would be one wrong tax number, now it could be one or two or twenty. Mistakes happen in the real life. This is one of the most common things we face. Mistakes happened before GST as well, now they just happen in multiples. And we really can't expect people to make mistakes because they always will. Again efficiency goes down as multiple times the effort is required to fix the mistakes.

c) Missing GST: It isn't necessary that all companies will have a GST registration in every state. So Tata Motors might not have a registered office in 2 states for example ie they won't have a GST number. They will now have to provide a declaration to Pepperfry saying that they don't have a GST number for two states, and then Pepperfry will be able to give them the invoice. The payment of the money is delayed till then. Getting that declaration in my experience takes a long time because if Tata Motors says that, they aren't able to claim input tax credit in that state. That's like leaving money on the table for them - and getting this declaration basically saying that they are willing to lose money on the transaction, requires approvals upto the highest levels because it is a loss to the company. Manoj now has to follow up on two more time consuming things to get the same amount of money and thus efficiency goes down further.

**/2) Cash Flow:** Cash is the lifeline of a company. A company without cash cannot survive. They could be valued at a billion dollars but if they don't have cash to pay their employees, they will shut down. Kingfisher couldn't pay their employees, interest, vendors because they didn't have cash left, same for Jet - again doesn't have cash for payment of salaries, fuel, loan payments, etc. BSNL again is struggling to pay for things because they don't have cash.

Thus a healthy cash flow is one of the most important aspects of the business or for the survival of the company. If companies were people, cash flow would be the oxygen. Invoicing is how cash is brought into the company.

Because of the decrease in efficiency of the collection managers, a delay is introduced in the collection of the cash. So if pre-GST cash was being collected in 25 days, now it would be taking say 45 days because the collection managers efficiency has gone down.

And the tiny delays add up. Incorrect GST - add another 7 days for that cash to be collected, missing GST - add 15 days, etc.

This has two outcomes:

Firstly, because Pepperfry had earlier predicted that they'll get the money in 30 days but they are now receiving it in 45 days, that means the 70 lakhs they need at the 30th day for their daily expenses now needs to be found from somewhere else since this 70 days will now be coming after another 2 weeks. They will have to dip into the reserves for 15 days.

Secondly, the money has lost some value. It was 70 lakhs at the end of 30 days but now since time has passed, it has lost some value due to the time value of money. It could've generated interest or it could've been invested but now this is delayed and hence some value is lost. This is a loss to Pepperfry.

To summarize, **GST has delayed the payment cycle of the company. It now takes longer to collect the same amount of money than it used to before GST was introduced. If money takes longer to come in, it takes longer to go out - salaries, interest payments, vendor payments, and other outflows are impacted.**

**/3 Profit:** The profit made on a deal varies from company to company and deal to deal. Let us assume that Pepperfry made 10% profit on this deal ie 7 lakhs. Due to the following factors this profit will get impacted:

a) The payment cycle is delayed so they're collecting the profit after a longer duration. They will have to collect 63 lakhs before they start making a profit. This could be after say they've collected 13 of the 20 invoices. The remaining 7 will give them their profit. So basically profit generation is delayed because the cash flow has been delayed. This means that the profit made on the deal has lost some value. If pre-GST this was 7 lakhs, now it'll be less than 7 lakhs in value due to the time value of money. And again because efficiency has gone down, the effort required to generate the same amount of profit has gone up, and thus the profit on the deal has actually gone down.

b) There are 20 invoices to process. Not all will always go through. Many will get stuck and the payment will be delayed or may never come due to the process issues. The money that will just linger there and never come to Pepperfry will become a bad debt to them. If the invoice gets stuck for some reason like incorrect GST, missing GST, incorrect value, the cash won't be collected for that invoice and that amount will get reduced from the profit. So because the invoice hasn't gotten processed, the 7 lakhs profit will now be less say 5 lakhs. If more than 7 lakhs is not collected on the deal, then Pepperfry will actually make a loss on the deal.

The biggest culprits of this are PSU's like HPCL, BPCL, UBI, etc. Their requirements are so stringent that if there is a single mistake and they hold the invoice. This payment could get delayed for years and thus the profit on the deal is impacted. They just won't pay till everything on the invoice is correct or they could delay for multiple other reasons. Many businesses don't sell to PSU's because of this reason - their profits and cash get stuck in doing business with them.

This is different from pre-GST because earlier if say there was a mistake, there was one invoice to fix. Now there could be many. For the same amount of revenue as before, now chances are you won't make the same amount of profit.

**Thus due to the lowered efficiency, longer payment cycle and stuck payments, the profit made has gotten impacted.**

&#x200B;

In conclusion to my ramblings, due to the state-specific nature of GST, the effort required to make the same amount of money as the pre-GST era has gone up. This has impacted the revenue and thus the profit made by companies and these are problems that everyone will face because of how GST is. If you want to do business in multiple states, you will have to be ready to face these challenges.

Feel free to discuss the impact this will have on our economy. In my opinion it has had a big impact but I really need someone much more knowledgeable than me to analyze and publish that. I feel this deserves a conversation at the very least because this one change has impacted revenue and profit extensively, it has made making money harder and thus is going to have a lasting impact on the economy. The worst part is it doesn't look like this system is going to change in the near future.

Business/Finance,Rant - What are we even doing here?,15,do5hj9,dropctuned,13,"What are we even doing here? For millennia, the uber rich have controlled the world. With access to better education, networking, medical, climate, resources, and technology, is it even fair for someone from a third world country or other developing nations to dream about achieving the kind of lifestyle that an average first world citizen takes for granted?

&#x200B;

Spending most of your childhood and early adulthood studying and training to land a middling job in a company is what is defined as success today. People want security and stability - something these companies seem to promise. Yet, there have been an incredible number of stories about people getting laid off for no other reason than the company hit a rough patch for once in several years. 

&#x200B;

And then there are startups, the latest in a list of Ponzi schemes designed to drain the finance out of people looking to make money. With scumbag CEOs who are able to raise funding based off of their networks from ivy league colleges (that their daddy paid a dear amount to get them into), who have absolutely no business acumen, giving themselves salaries in millions of dollars, while the wide eyed, naive poor people or immigrants who have worked hard their entire lives in the hopes of bettering their lifestyles struggle to pay rent till they are laid off, what are we even doing here? 

&#x200B;

Echo chambers are designed to consolidate like minded people into their own virtual spaces. With confirmation bias playing a significant role in hindering mental evolution, is it really a surprise that people are getting dumber by the day? For a society to be healthy and functional, different points of view must be at the very least - considered. But, when all you hear are cheers for your bigoted and backward views - it marks the end of higher thought. 

&#x200B;

The system is broken - and neither democracy nor socialism/communism is the answer. Dictatorship isn’t either. Just for clarity, violence and anger are not the answers either. The last 20 years have seen the kind of global change that our ancestors could never have imagined. Yet, our philosophies of governance have not evolved. Our constitutions are old, and our leaders are too far gone. We need to come up with new ways - starting from scratch - to govern ourselves if we want to take the next step to human evolution.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/do5hj9/rant_what_are_we_even_doing_here/

Business/Finance,Will India embrace blockchain?,2,e8as8b,y0ujin,2,"India has followed China in its wish to embrace the blockchain technology. The India Times reported on Nov. 27, 2019, that India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is set to embrace blockchain technology adopting a national strategy.

The minister of state for electronics and information technology Sanjay Dhotre said a few weeks ago:

>Considering the potential of Blockchain Technology and the need for shared infrastructure for different use cases, an approach paper on National Level Blockchain Framework is being prepared.\[...\] Blockchain Technology as one of the important research areas having application potential in different domains such as Governance, Banking and Finance, Cyber Security, and so on.

Besides, the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has supported a blockchain project ""Distributed Centre of Excellence in Blockchain Technology."" Blockchain-based ""Proof of Existence (PoE)"" framework is being developed for different uses (authenticating academic certificates, sale deeds, and other documents) by the ministry. Dhotre added:

>By using the PoE framework, \[a\] solution is developed to authenticate academic certificates. Blockchain technology has also been used, and PoC \[proof-of-concept\] is developed for vehicle life cycle management and hotel registry management.

India is developing a property registration based on the blockchain, which is being piloted in Telangana state. Other blockchain use-cases are focused on cloud security, trade finance, and central KYC.

It is worth noting that India has been experimenting with blockchain since 2017. According to Deloitte's research conducted in April 2017, Indian players tried to implement blockchain in such spheres as trade finance, supply chain financing, e-KYC document management, cross-border payments, and others.

Though India seems to be ""pro-blockchain,"" it is still negative on crypto. On July 16, 2019, India proposed a draft bill banning trading and using cryptocurrencies. To separate cryptocurrency from digital rupee and digital foreign currencies (which are backed by Central banks), the government has given a definition of crypto in the draft bill:

>Any information or code or number or token not being part of any official digital currency, generated through cryptographic means or otherwise, providing a digital representation of value which is exchange with or without consideration, with the promise or representation of having inherent value in any business activity which may involve risk of loss or an expectation of profits or income, or functions as a store of value or a unit of account and includes its use in any financial transaction or investment, but not limited to, investment schemes.

Apart from that, the report has named several reasons to ban crypto and impose fines and penalties for conducting any activities connected with it in India.

1. Crypto is created by non-sovereigns and serves as a private enterprise in this sense.
2. Crypto has no underlying intrinsic value and lacks all the characteristics of a currency.
3. Crypto has no fixed nominal value, so it neither acts as a store of value nor as a medium of exchange.
4. Crypto is extremely volatile.
5. Crypto cannot serve the purpose of a currency as it is ""inconsistent with the essential functions of money/currency"", so it cannot replace fiat.

Business/Finance,"Pakodanomics, Ola-Uber Theory, Box Office Theory",6,dlf5x8,spider143,4,"So when the most intellectual people of the country, honourable  Prime Minister, Finance Minister and IT Minister have made comments on the economy, I decided to go around and look in own way. 

***Note****: I am not an economist. I work in the IT sector and have been outside India from last two years.* 

Last week I visited Vijaywada, Andhra Pradesh almost after two years. All my relatives have settled there and once in a while, I make a visit there. To my surprise, I noticed a lot of changes in the way people spend money and businesses going there.

1. **Vastralatha** is a shopping complex in Vijayawada where a lot of wholesale shopping happens. Shop owners get the clothing raw materials (and clothes) from different locations and sell them there. It is almost the first stop for almost most of the clothes/clothing-material after manufacturing. On having a discussion with one the shopkeeper I came to know that his business gone down drastically. Despite Deepawali coming, there is no surge in sales. He says, ***""There is no cash in the market, how will people buy the goods"".*** Just to know more of him, I tried being naive and said that the government is promoting digital transactions and hence cash is less in the market, to which he replied showing a chart with many QR-codes printed on it, ***""I have PhonePe, Paytm, BHIM, Google-Pay as modes of payments still no increase in business after adopting them"".*** I said that maybe Amazon and Flipkart are consuming his business and he should try moving to online. ***""Nothing in online comes drops from air. They also must go from some outlet. I myself have proxies on Amazon and Flipkart""***
2. Vijayawada is almost like a business capital of Andhra Pradesh. A lot of people from neighbouring places come there to sell their products too. Hence a good number of 2-star and 3-star lodges are there in outskirts of Vijayawada. I then visited one such lodge, which is run by one of my friend's relative. I asked him about the hotel business the past few months to he replied, ***""Has dropped almost half in the last six months. Very few come now, and even those who come are unmarried couples.""***
3. The next day I visited a place called **Poranki**. It is outskirts of Vijayawada, almost a town. I like junk food around and generally eat at around 9:00 PM. The junk food stalls are open till 10:30 PM. I went out that day around 8:00 PM and to my surprise, I found almost all the shops closed. After wandering for 15 mins I found a shop where I ordered **Mirpakayi Bajji (***Mirchi Bhajji/ Big Chillies Fried***).** After having two of them I asked stallkeeper why have the shops closed so fast to which he replied, ***""Are you new to this place. It is happening almost from last one year. No one is having money. Those who have are also spending very cautiously. Due to the lack of customers, I am forced to close the shops early""***
4. The next day morning I visited my village from **Poranki**. *(I am sorry, I cannot tell you the village name for privacy reasons).* My grandma lives there. Besides her home, there are a lot of uneducated people who make materials like hand fans, mats, brooms, etc from coconut leaves and straw. They make them there and then go and sell locally or in other towns and cities. The place used to gleam with joy and noise when people used to sit together and stitch mats. All of that was absent. I asked our neighbour why. He replied, ***""There are more than 150 mats in stock not sold. What is the use of sitting and making more of them.""*** People make these products and travel via big share autos generally to towns. Autos are more frequent and easily available. The afternoon I went to our village bus stop, where autos also are parked nearby. I took a share auto and asked the driver about very fewer people at the bus stop. He said , ***""No one is going out of the village even to sell. Last week 3 autos drivers had sold their autos and moved into other businesses.""***

**My personal inference**: A lot bad is going. The news channels are not showing anything. The ones that do show about this, are yet very far away from the ground realities. I am just wondering about farm labours who have no source of income except daily wage. The news channels and people bragging about Hindi-Muslim debate are either paid or brainwashed. At the ground, there are many structural problems.

Business/Finance,In need of urgent advice regarding career! Please help.,14,czff99,nosleepnomore,3,"Hi,

I am a 25 year old Indian national living in Thailand with my family. I did my undergrad in Thailand in BBA in Finance. After that I joined my family trading business of loose diamonds. After a year in the business, I joined a Thailand based diamond jewelry export company (owned by an Indian-American). 

I am working in the jewelry company for the past two years but since I am the youngest I am given odd works. I am being paid 55,000 baht per month (after tax). 

I was wondering what my options for a secure future are? I am starting to get complacent in my job - getting comfortable with my monthly salary which I do not want. If I get fired or if I want to switch my job, I do not feel I have enough skills to get an equivalent salary. 

Another issue is that the jewelry industry is shrinking. I am also not sure if I enjoy the industry as much. I have a few options in mind but opinions are needed. My options are -
1. CFA
2. MBA
3. Starting a business

I am so confused in life about my career that I hate even thinking about it. My work timings are 8:30 am to 6:30 pm (Mon-Fri). Saturdays I work 8:30 am to 12:00 pm.

I have around 10 lakh baht saved since I live with my family. But we do not have any asset - no house, car, etc.

Please help.

Edit - For MBA, I would love to go to the Western countries or India - wouldn't do it in Thailand. I do not mind shifting back to India if required. My family is not very well off. My parents do not have a lot of money save for their retirement.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/czff99/in_need_of_urgent_advice_regarding_career_please/

Business/Finance,Business and boxing: two sides of the same coin,6,cqzusw,assousa,0,"By James M. Dorsey



A podcast version of this story is available on Soundcloud, Itunes, Spotify, Stitcher, TuneIn, Spreaker, Pocket Casts, Tumblr, and Patreon, Podbean and Castbox.



What do a planned US$15 billion Saudi investment in petroleum-related Indian businesses and a controversial boxing championship have in common?



Both reflect a world in which power and economics drive policy, politics and business at the expense of fundamental rights.



And both underscore an emerging new world order in which might is right, a jungle in which dissenters, minorities and all other others are increasingly cornered and repressed.



Rather than furthering stability by building inclusive, cohesive societies both support trends likely to produce an evermore unstable and insecure world marked by societal strife, mass migration, radicalization and violence.



A world in which business capitalizes on decisions by a critical mass of world leaders who share autocratic, authoritarian and illiberal principles of governance and often reward each other with lucrative business deals for policies that potentially aggravate rather than reduce conflict.



No doubt, the planned acquisition by Saudi Arabia’s state-owned national oil company Aramco of 20 percent of the petroleum-related businesses of Reliance Industries, one of India’s biggest companies, makes commercial and strategic economic and business sense.



Yet, there is equally little doubt that the announcement of the acquisition will be read by Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, days after he scrapped the autonomous status of the troubled, majority Muslim region of Kashmir, as a license to pursue his Hindu nationalist policies that discriminate against Muslims and other minorities and fuel tensions with Pakistan, the subcontinent’s other nuclear power.



The ultimate cost of the fallout of policies and business deals that contribute or give license to exclusion rather than inclusion of all segments of a population and aggravate regional conflict could be far higher than the benefits accrued by the parties to a deal.



Underscoring the risk of exclusionary policies and unilateral moves, cross border skirmishes between Indian and Pakistani forces erupted this week along the Kashmiri frontier in which at least five people were killed.



The timing of the announcement of the Aramco Reliance deal in a global environment in which various forms of racism and prejudice, including Islamophobia, are on the rise, assures Indian political and business leaders that they are unlikely to pay an immediate price for policies that sow discord and risk loss of life.



Like in the case of Saudi and Muslim acquiescence in China’s brutal clampdown on Turkic Muslims in the troubled, north-western Chinese province of Xinjiang, the most frontal assault on a faith in recent history, the announcement risks convincing embattled Muslim minorities like the Uighurs, the Kashmiris or Myanmar’s Rohingya who are lingering in refugee camps in Bangladesh that they are being hung out to dry.



To be sure, Kashmiris can count on the support of Pakistan but that is likely to be little more than emotional, verbal and political.



Pakistan is unlikely to risk blacklisting by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international anti-money laundering and terrorism finance watchdog, at its next scheduled meeting in October by unleashing its anti-Indian militants.



Anthony Joshua’s controversial fight with Andy Ruiz scheduled for December in Saudi Arabia, the first boxing championship to be held in the Middle East, pales in terms of its geopolitical or societal impact compared to the Saudi Indian business deal.



Fact is that Saudi Arabia’s hosting of the championship has provoked the ire of activists rather than significant population groups. The fight is furthermore likely to be seen as evidence and a strengthening of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s selective efforts to socially liberalize the once austere kingdom.



Nonetheless, it also reinforces Prince Mohammed’s justified perception that Saudi Arabia can get away with imprisoning activists who argued in favour of his reforms as well as the lack of transparency on judicial proceedings against the alleged perpetrators of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia insists the killing was perpetrated by rogue operatives.



What Saudi investment in India and the scheduled boxing championship in the kingdom have in common is that both confirm the norms of a world in which ‘humane authority,’ a concept developed by prominent Chinese international relations scholar Yan Xuetong, is a rare quantity.



Mr. Yan employs the concept to argue without referring to President Xi Jinping, Xinjiang, China’s aggressive approach towards the South China Sea or its policy towards Taiwan and Hong Kong that China lacks the humane authority to capitalize on US President Donald J. Trump’s undermining of US leadership.



Mr. Yan defines a state that has humane authority as maintaining strategic credibility and defending the international order by becoming an example through adherence to international norms, rewarding states that live up to those norms and punishing states that violate them. Garnering humane authority enables a state to win allies and build a stable international order.



Mr. Yan’s analysis is as applicable to India and Saudi Arabia as it is to China and others that tend towards civilizational policies like the United States, Russia, Hungary and Turkey.



It is equally true for men like Anthony Joshua promoter Eddie Hearn and business leaders in general.



To be sure, Aramco is state-owned and subject to government policy. Nonetheless, as it prepares for what is likely to be the world’s largest initial public offering, even Aramco has to take factors beyond pure economic and financial criteria into account.



At the end of the day, the consequence of Mr. Yan’s theory is that leadership, whether geopolitical, economic or business, is defined as much by power and opportunity as it is by degrees of morality and ethics.



Failure to embrace some notion of humane authority and reducing leadership and business decisions to exploiting opportunity with disregard for consequences or the environment in which they are taken is likely to ultimately haunt political and business leaders alike.



Said Mr. Yan: “Since the leadership of a humane authority is able to rectify those states that disturb the international order, the order based on its leadership can durably be maintained.”

What is true for political leaders is also true for business leaders even if they refuse to acknowledge that their decisions have as much political as economic impact.

Business/Finance,India's Elections: A Reading List,21,b9p4dc,madamplease,10,"With elections coming up in a few months, it's a good time to catch up on the history and background to India's parliamentary elections.

■ **Ornit Shahni, [How India Became Democratic](https://penguin.co.in/book/uncategorized/how-india-became-democratic/) (Penguin, 2018)**

Shahni's book is a fascinating historical account of how the first electoral rolls in India were prepared. This is a process that is so technical and bureacratic that we don't always stop to consider how this laid the foundation for our democracy today. She uses archival materials to bring out how people struggled to gain the fundamental democratic right to vote in our first elections, and how this struggle informed the Constitution-making process.

Banerjee's book is an ethnographic study that attempts to answer the question of why Indians exercise their right to vote. Through interviews in a number of states, including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan, she asks ordinary voters why they vote, what they think of politics and elections, and what drives them to participate in the democratic process.

FARMERS AND AGRARIAN DISTRESS


Quote
Indian farmers have, for long, ensured that the country does not face any food shortage. The time has finally come for the PM to declare: “I am confident Indian farmers can feed the nation, I annul the Essential Commodities Act”. The most critical reform to revolutionise Indian agriculture requires no money. It requires something far harder to acquire — learning to unlearn yesterday’s wisdom.

But the needs of citizens within different states are quite different. Respect regional aspirations. One size cannot fit all, ever, in India, or elsewhere.


2. Why is the gov increasingly taking democratic institutions for granted? Ex: using governor states to boss around in the administrative matter of state government. Ex: tamilnadu, new delhi, puducherry, karnataka.



HEALTH CARE



Why does the government not take inspiration from NHS scheme in the UK (which provides efficient and great healthcare to UK residents)?


Why does the gov not allocating enough budget for health care despite india ranking low in HDI even with our neighbours countries ?




OTHER



Is it unparliamentary to hug someone in parliament as suggested by Bhupendra Chaubey?


Why are ministers with unscientific viewpoint still given cabinet portfolios?


Why does government not invest in Cyber Security like other major countries like China, Russia and USA? Our government websites and databases are not fully secured (as evident from data being accessed by fs0ciety from AP govt. website) We have great Security Engineers, but they are all employed in Private Sector.


Why was AAP asked to repay the amount they spent from government treasury on advertisement, but BJP keeps plastering Modi’s photo everyday in the newspapers and online advertisement (nearly Rs 4600 crores) without any repercussions?

Business/Finance,"[serious] HELP, I invented something.",52,9t7uyw,cooltechpec,29,"Posting for my cousin
M21, Delhi

&#x200B;

I've invented a stationary utility device and now want to turn it in a business. I've applied for design, patent,trademarks as Intellectual properties. I have completed msme and gst registration. i've prepared visiting cards, proprietor stamp, installed billing software and a 100 pgs letterpad. I have a batch of 400 pcs ready to test the market .  I won't disclose it before the launch so please don't ask about it (no offence).

Not bragging just giving the information, I've done everything alone from research to paperwork to purchase raw material to manufacturing( plastic parts come from factory. i have to assemble it and pack in the box) to finance/money stuff (ca does gst returns). It has really taken a toll on me.

&#x200B;

here's my work environment.

i want to operate from home. my parents are agreed to this and i have access to half of first floor. it's a single room where i do the assembly(tightening screws to join parts) and packing and in one corner i have a table where i do rest of company related work from a laptop.

i'm trying to outsource the packing and assembly but still i'll have to store raw materials and final stock in that room till sent to amazon warehouse or factory.

&#x200B;

i really don't have budget for renting a shop and hiring employee. i want to execute this testing phase alone. if it'll be successfull then i'll get a shop, employees and other equipments but rightnow i don't want to create too much financial burdon on my parents

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

my queries are

1. can i do my business from home . do i need to do any paperwork or permission or licencing. my stock takes space only about a refrigerator.  and all i need a printer and laptop for other stuff.
2. do i need commercial electricity meter. if so, then can my father apply for that (he owns the house and is a GOVT. employee). Is there any way i can avoid that as i'll get my own shop after testing phase and that commercial connection at home will be a waste.

&#x200B;

3.  do i need to pay rent to parents.

&#x200B;

4. can i  cause complications for my father as he's a govt. employee.

&#x200B;

5. do i need any permission from mcd or other anyone.

&#x200B;

6 do i need current account. my expenses are small and i'm currently operating from savings account.  banks (hdfc, icici, bob,axis) are asking for in house verifications and demanding a banner in front of my house. i'll never put a banner in front of house as padosi bade madar\*\*\*\* hain.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

anything else you want to advice me you're welcome guys. I'm just a 21 year old trying to escape from the rat race and want to really contribute something to the world.

&#x200B;

\[EDIT\]   do i need to register  or do anything under shop and establishment act? 

&#x200B;

do i need a manufacturers licence ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9t7uyw/serious_help_i_invented_something/
Business/Finance,What would be a better decision? [Serious],22,abqu80,nosleepnomore,17,"24 year old male, working in a day job from 8 am to 8 pm. I come from a BBA in Finance background but have been working in a jewellery factory. 

I want to learn to programme and investing in the little free time I have. Programming so that I can switch jobs in two years or at the least freelance (Note: I have zero knowledge about programming). Also, after reading several articles, they mention programming is one of the jobs that is to stay even when robots become prevalent. 

My second option is to start an online business. I do not know what the business will be as I really haven't thought about it.

What would you do if you were in my position? Develop skills or start a side hustle?

Business/Finance,Please help me with career advice,18,ahuc0c,nosleepnomore,13,"I am a 24 year old male with BBA in Finance. I studied in Thailand. My family lives in Thailand. We have a diamond trading business. I worked with my dad for a year before finding a job in a jewelry factory. I have been working in this factory for little over a year now.

I am being paid 55k baht a month. The problem is, there isn't much growth in this industry. I feel the industry is shrinking. I am hoping to get out by this year. Another problem is, it is very difficult to get a job as a foreigner in Thailand. 

What skills can I develop on the side so I can switch industries? I am thinking programming. But I have no prior knowledge. I do not mind coming back to India for work.

Is MBA a good option? What other ways can I make money on the side?

Business/Finance,Broke up 30! What next???,14,al2pdh,ablahnaari,12,"Hi Everyone,

I browse through reddit quite a bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships/life.So here goes my story.

A little about myself. I'm 30 yr old Indian woman working in IT and earning well. I am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left us.She has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other Indian families.

I had my share of relations when I was young and I was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20's and I made good use of it. I started traveling and over years have come to love it. Travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say I am decent at both. Being single also taught me value of friendships and I'm fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years.

I met my bf (32 yrs) two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together. As we started talking about future I realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business/ agriculture (he mentioned it casually once a yr ago. I had no idea he was serious about it).  I refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career. I hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances. For the reasons above and also that I would be giving up all my friends,leaving my mom,work, travel everything for one person seemed like a bad deal.

We tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup. This breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything. I want to stop feeling negative about my ex (somewhere I feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs) and stop feeling sad for myself. I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head.Any suggestions are welcome!

Thanks,

Ablahnaari!

Business/Finance,Is it possible to switch careers at 24? Please help.,8,besg9q,nosleepnomore,3,"I started working in a loose diamonds family business at 22. Worked only for a year and switched to a jewelry factory because it was difficult to work with my dad. 

I am 24 and still at the jewelry factory. The timings are tough - 9 am to 7 pm Mon-Fri. 9 am to 3 pm on Saturdays. I get paid only 55k. But most importantly, this is a dead end job. There is a stagnation in learning and earning after a few years. My manager with an experience of 18 years earns only 130k a month.

I am planning to self-teach web development. I do not come from a technical background. I did my undergrad in BBA in Finance. 

Is it possible to switch careers at this age? Is it possible to get jobs in Singapore, Hong Kong or other countries as a self-taught web developer?

Another option is to keep doing this job while freelance as a web developer. Is this possible?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/besg9q/is_it_possible_to_switch_careers_at_24_please_help/

Business/Finance,"Due to family problems, I had to forego my college education. Now I may have the option to finally do something about that. Please advice me on how to proceed? [Long]",37,9pj0at,random_throwaway1579,19,"Sorry this is a bit long. Tl;dr at bottom

&#x200B;

I come from a middle-class family in Gujarat, and I passed my 12th commerce from a CBSE school. I got good grades and was able to enroll in a very good college in Mumbai, and everything was going well for me. After I got my admission I went back to my hometown to prepare to move to Mumbai in a hostel, when my grandfather who was already in ill-health passed away.

&#x200B;

Now he did not have a will and most of what we owned was in my father's elder brothers name already and what was in my grandfathers name was usurped by him as well. He kicked my father out of the family business as well as made threats for us to leave the place we were staying in(It was registered to my grandpas name). This meant my own families financial status went from somewhat stable to completely in shambles. We were blindsided and that meant I had to stay and help my father weather the storm. At first I thought we'd bounce back in a month or 2 and having never known poverty I never knew ho much people struggled. But it only got worse for us. My father is an 8th pass and could not get normal jobs, so he decided to start a new business and I took a job with a friend of his due to my English skills.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After some time passed then scumbag had us evicted as he and my aunt(bua) made some deal that she should have the house. I do not know the details of what they did but we were forced to rent a place and our already poor finances were shot to pieces. My father started to work as a salesman cause no other option and I took on a bigger role at his friends place. But things were still hard and we were barely making ends meet.

&#x200B;

I forgot all about my college and education, never going back to Mumbai after my enrollment. My family trudged along for 2 and a half years but things are changing now. My father has a childhood friend who is offering my father a good role in his business back in their old village. He is moving there and starts at first November. Now he told me that I can finally go to Mumbai and finish my college if I wanted to but I'm not even sure what to do at this point.

&#x200B;

I never went to Mumbai after my admission but this year would have been my final year. Am I still even enrolled there? They have my documents as I never collected them back. But I never paid any fees except what you pay on enrollment. My father wants me to go and try to study as he thinks his lack of education was a major reason for our family's crisis cause he had nothing to fall back on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But I don't even know if I am enrolled there anymore. The college is affiliated with Mumbai university but I could not find any details about their code on skipping exams\[By exams I mean skipping everything :( \] on google. And even If I'm still enrolled how long would it take me to finish my degree. Hell at this point I'm pondering is a [B.com](https://B.com) even worth it? My dream was to do a masters from foreign but even If I finish my degree will I get enrollment in any institute as I had these many drop years. I am really confused at this point weather to move to the village with my family or try to pursue an education.

&#x200B;

If anyone has any knowledge on how Mumbai university operates or even any advice on how to proceed please help me.

&#x200B;

Tl;dr : Scumbag uncle and aunt usurped everything and I could not attend a single day of college. Now I may finally be able to go but Idk if I am even enrolled there anymore. Please help. Any advice appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9pj0at/due_to_family_problems_i_had_to_forego_my_college/

Business/Finance,"So you made yourself a little bit of money, huh? How nice.",26,9ypjsr,DexterMilburn,11,"# So you made yourself a little bit of money, huh? How nice.
&nbsp;

All your life, all you've ever wanted, is a little bit of money. And congratulations, now you have it. Does it feel nice? Does it feel like a dream come true? Of course it doesn't. It's all just numbers on a screen, staring at you like a pathetic joke. But thanks to your thankless job, you made yourself a little bit of money. How nice.

And now, you, in all your half-decayed intelligence, have decided that you want to invest the little bit of money that you've made? Well, step right up to the raging wildfire that is the field of investing. We've got a shit-show full of stocks, mutual funds, bonds, real estate, gold and other commodities, all clamouring for your attention, and even more for your money. Done properly, you can retire into an ungodly amount of wealth. And done poorly, you can join the majority of investors setting their cash on fire, day in and day out. 

But don't feel daunted or scared. You're on the right path, and that's probably the only time you're going to hear those words in your life. Just the fact that you're thinking about investing your money puts you at a major advantage, just the fact that you've even made a little bit money is extremely rare. Look around you, what do you see? People that are so poor that they're crawling out of their tents on the roadside, people that are such douchebags that they're buying worthless bling like fur sweaters and gold chains, people that are so childish that they absolutely have to buy the latest iPhone with their credit cards, and people that are so dumb that they just can't be bothered to learn about investing. Just the fact that you're here now, thinking about investing, makes you part of an exclusive club.

Before you get ahead of yourself and feel one cent of happiness for being better off than most, let me tell you something - there's an army of twats waiting to screw you out of the little bit of money that you've made, an army of twats who wants to take away the only thing that matters to your miserable existence anymore. These are crooked relationship managers who'll sell you anything to get commissions. These are unsuspecting relatives who'll recommend terrible investments just because they don't know any better. These are seedy stock brokers who'll push schemes offering incredibly high returns that are too good to be true. These are corrupt financial advisors who'll destroy your returns, either because they're incompetent or unscrupulous, or both. You've got an entire armada of twats just waiting to snatch the money right out of your wallet. What're you going to do about that? Are you going to put your head down and hand over the cash? Are you going to run to your mommy like the little bitch that you are? No, you're going to pull out a knife and stab that little twat right in the heart. And here's how to do that, beginning with a set of basic guidelines. 

&nbsp;
##### Savings are sexy
Let's be honest, you were never made of the stuff that gave wet dreams to women. Well, here's your chance. You know what all the girls like these days? It's not that ripped chest, or that sleak jawline. It's a man who saves. Step aside AXE body spray, there's a new sheriff in town. If you're spending more than you're earning, you've got bigger problems to worry. Before anything else, you need to make sure that you're bringing in more money than you're spending. So reign in your spending, delay gratification. That burger is going to taste pretty much the same without the overpriced slice of cheese. And the movie will probably be on Netflix in a few months.

&nbsp;
##### Debt is your kryptonite
So you borrowed a little bit of money and are now stuck with the interest payments. That's okay, who hasn't done dumb stuff when they were young and full of hormones. I know I have. This one time I cleaned up an entire jar of mayonnaise thinking it was yogurt. Set some money aside every month, not just to pay the monthly minimum on your loans, but a little more so you can pre-pay all your debts. Some loans take priority over others: pay off your credit cards, personal loans and similar high-interest debt first. Keep in mind that not all loans are straight poison: those that help you develop assets like a home loan or increase future income like an education loan or business loan are alright. However, investing while carrying a high amount of debt is like playing football with one leg tied behind your back. Not exactly ideal.

&nbsp;
##### Read like your life depends on it
Stop reading WhatsApp forwards, pick up a book, and then pick another one. If you don't develop a habit of reading properly, you're going to get a lot of poop flinged at you in this business. But if you can make it through a book every once in a while, get read to fling some poop on the n00bs. You don't have to go straight for the finance section. Begin with any book that sounds interesting to you, and work your way up. Reading not only helps you understand the world around you, but also develops a better personality and temperament within you. Most of you have the patience and memory of a goldfish, and generally speaking, goldfishes are not good investors.

&nbsp;
##### Gold is old
Gold was what housewives in the 70s stockpiled in their cupboard because they had no other option. But you, you are the child of the 20th century. You actually know how to turn on the wi-fi. You have better options, like mutual funds. No matter what your uncle from the third cousin over says, investing in gold is setting your cash on fire. All it will do is make you feel good from the inside, while the eternal fireplace fuelled by your cash keeps burning in the background. Gold and silver are metals that we dig out of the ground. As an investment, they just sit there and stare at you. Just because they shine doesn't mean they're good investments. However, not everyone is convinced of this basic guideline. So if you're hell bent on investing in gold, I recommend going into the mountains and throwing yourself off a tall cliff. A medium-sized one works too.

&nbsp;
##### Insurance =/= Investing
While housewives in the 70s had gold, housewives in the 80s had LIC*. Getting life insurance is critical if you have family that depends on your income, but insurance and investing, like pizza and pineapple, never mix well. Have you ever wondered what the insurance company does after collecting your premium money? Well, the company invests your premium money in stocks and bonds, which is also what mutual funds do. So let the insurance people insure, and let the investing people invest. Separation of labour was something that the caveman figured out in 2nd century. It's time you evolved from being a caveman.

&nbsp;
##### Real estate is not real investing
The only reason for you to buy property is if you're going to be living in it. Buying real estate purely as an investment is one of the worst decisions you could ever make. Real estate: is an illiquid market (need to wait to find a buyer or seller), has high transaction costs (stamp duty and other bullshit charges), has a lot of red tape (needs several government approvals) and faces high maintenance costs (occasional cost of paint and plumbing here and there). However, every other Tom, Dick and Harry will tell you that real estate is a great investment. Why? Because real estate is how Indians signal wealth to others. It is how Indians demand respect from the *chaar log* committee. It's how we tell people that we've got a big dick, and we're not afraid to swing it around. You don't have a big dick. Tuck that little stinker back in your pants. You're just embarrassing yourself.

&nbsp;
##### Pick your poison properly
Identifying the bad investments is a greater skill than identifying the good investments. Now that gold and real estate have been vilified as bad investments, let's turn to the places that actually deserve your money - mutual funds. For the uninitiated, which includes most of you idiots, a mutual fund collects your money and invests it in the stock market on your behalf. A diversified basket of stocks in good quality companies will outperform most other investments over any time period longer than 10 years. Mutual funds can give you this diversified basket of stocks. If you haven't been living under a rock for the past few years, you've probably see the advertising campaign - *Mutual Funds Sahi Hai*. And if you have been living under a rock, stay there. We're doing great without you.

&nbsp;
##### Get yourself into a coma
The best investors, the ones who win the game in the long-term, always have patience. When you're investing in stocks or mutual funds, you need to have a minimum time horizon of more than 5 years. Any less than that, and out come the fireplaces that are fuelled by your cash. Mentally, you need to be in a place where the stock market might run off a cliff screaming into the wind tomorrow morning, and you'll still continue investing as per your plan because you're thinking about the long term. This ensures that your emotions, influenced by the ups and downs of the stock market, don't get in your own way. Ideally, you want to invest and immediately get yourself into a coma. Trust me, no one will notice that you're gone. You're one person in a world with seven billion people. You're really insignificant in the larger scheme of the Illuminati.

&nbsp;
##### Don't watch CNBC
All your life, you've only made socially acceptable choices, because you crave validation from the people around you. To your repitillian brain, approval from strangers feels better than an orgasm. But when it comes to investing, never seek validation of your choices, especially not from the pundits on CNBC. Televised business news focuses on the shortest of short terms, while you need to keep your eye on the longest of long terms. Yes, it is important to keep tabs on current events, but there are far better sources of information than the nightly news. I recommend reading Livemint and Reuters for news. Those two outfits did not pay me to endorse them, but if the PR people over there are reading this, give me a call. I accept cash, cheques and PayTM. Fuck it, I'll even take bitcoin.

&nbsp;
##### Keep It Simple, Shithead
Here is a basic plan on how to use your money when you get paid every month. First off, take care of any loans by paying off the hungry bankers who will come demanding their pound of flesh. Pay off all credit cards, in full and on time. Now, estimate how much you're going need for your monthly bills - this includes everything from your electric bill to your tab at the local bar. Deduct that amount and invest the rest of your money. When it comes to investing, begin by putting in three months of your monthly expenses in a liquid mutual fund. This is your emergency cash stash. Next up, depending on your time horizon and risk appetite, select a combination of ~3-8 mutual funds. There are a few different types of mutual funds, here's a handy rule of thumb to navigate them:
 
|                                    | High time horizon             | Low time horizon  |
|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|:------------------------:|
| **Low risk appetite**  |Large-cap equity funds      |Debt mutual funds  |
| **High risk appetite** |Mid/small/multi-cap equity funds|Debt mutual funds  |
 
When you're done, set up SIPs so that you don't have to do the transfers manually each month. Every year, take some time off to review this process.

&nbsp;

This basic plan will require tweaking, depending on the context of your life. But having that plan is very important, not just for your financial life but also for the rest of your life. In the back of your mind, you've always known that. But you never followed through on making a plan, and now your life is just a series of mistakes and regrets. Is that why you drink so much? 

The lords of literature require that I write a conclusion to this piece. But this is not the end. This is the beginning of your investing journey. The basic guidelines mentioned here are intended to serve as the starting point for your own research. These guidelines are not rocket science, they are not supposed to be complicated. A person of average intelligence and awareness can reasonably expect to understand and follow them. The question is: are you a person of average intelligence and awareness? Assuming that enough of you read this, statistics require half of you to admit that you're dumb as a rock.

Always keep an eye out for the armada of twats that will try to convince you that investing is rocket science, simply so they can charge you high fees or lure you into unprofitable investments. Done poorly, you can expect a mid-life crisis magnified by a bonfire of your cash. Done properly, you can create the kind of wealth that can benefit you as well as your future generations. You've already disappointed your parents. Don't disappoint your children now.

Business/Finance,The Kerala Model,142,79u1il,pure_haze,159,"Let's have an objective discussion of the merits & sustainability of the Kerala model. Please don't downvote if you merely disagree. 



1. Kerala started out with 47% literacy in 1951, at a time when UP had 12% and the India-wide average was 18.33%. To claim that Kerala is high on HDI purely from post-independence governments is a bit of a stretch; they started out with a relatively compact population (13.5m in 1951) and the most advantages among states, thanks to the focus on education by the local dynastic precursors, the Travancore Family, along with contributions with subgroups like the Nair Society and Christian Missionaries. 





3. Unemployment rate: Despite the dependence on remittances and foeign jobs, the state’s unemployment rate is 12.5% against the all-India level of 5%, making it the third highest in the country after Sikkim and Tripura.  [Source](http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/not-rank-state-wants-kerala-high-unemployment-we-need-more-entrepreneurs-govt-says-61216)



3. Political Violence and the most fertile ground for ISIS recruitment in India. [Kerala tops the crime rate list, with 16.3 riot cases per lakh people, followed by Bihar (12.9) and Karnataka (10.6).](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/327-rise-in-agrarian-riots-in-2015-NCRB-report-shows/article14598321.ece) [How Isis recruiters found fertile ground in Kerala, India's tourist gem.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/29/isis-recruiters-fertile-ground-kerala-indias-tourist-gem)



4. Second last in Ease of Doing Business Ranking amongst the general category (removing the somewhat isolated NE states, troubled J&K and small Union Territories besides Delhi) and 20th rank across India. [Source](https://medium.com/@thousifmohammed/why-kerala-rank-last-in-ease-of-doing-business-7da7ed96d113) 


5. Consequently, abysmal FDI inflows, at just over US$1.2billion in 2000-15 (the last 15 years), just 0.5% of total inflows. In contrast, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka received over US$17billion and US$16billion respectively in the same period. [Source](http://indien.ahk.de/fileadmin/ahk_indien/Bilder/2015_News_and_Info/economic_news/collab_-fdi_into_india.pdf)




6. High Debt/GSDP of 29.7% (2015 Budget Estimate) compared to an India-average of 21.2%. Though that's an estimate, the 2014 Revised Estimate was 31% and 2013 actual one was 31.6%. I would take the estimate with a grain of sand. [Source](http://niti.gov.in/content/debt-total-outstanding-liabilities-percenatge-gsdp) This is also with them having a monopoly over the liquor industry through BEVCO, and one of the highest per-capita consumption levels of alcohol by state. (That's cool, I have no issues with alcohol.)



7. Dire position of the State Finances: [Five charts that explain the crisis in Kerala’s economy.](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/HkujNa0LphyCVSoqFFIEWK/Five-charts-that-explain-the-crisis-in-the-Kerala-economy.html) They even exceeded the Fiscal Deficit Targets which they had committed too.







2. And finally, **the extreme dependence on remittances:** Remittances finance as many as 20% Kerala households, or 2.4 million families. Assuming a family size of three, remittances directly affect 7.2 million of 35 million Keralites, according to a recent paper in the Economic and Political Weekly by K C Zachariah and S Irudaya Rajan based on the Kerala Migration Survey, 2014. [Source](http://www.firstpost.com/india/gulf-remittances-to-kerala-drop-to-four-year-low-due-to-declining-oil-prices-2738866.html)



* Remittances, at Rs 70,000 crore, accounted for 36.3% of the net state domestic product (NSDP) in 2014.



* Remittances constitute a fourth — Rs 22,689 of Rs 86,180 — of the per capita income of Kerala in 2014.



* Remittances were 1.2 times the revenue generated by the Kerala government in 2014. 



____



I like this summary: **“Remittances from global capitalism are carrying the whole Kerala economy,”** said S. Irudaya Rajan, a demographer at the Center for Development Studies, a local research group. “There would have been starvation deaths in Kerala if there had been no migration. The Kerala model is good to read about but not practically applicable to any part of the world, including Kerala.” [Source: NYTimes- Jobs Abroad Support ‘Model’ State in India.](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/07/world/asia/07migrate.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1) It's a pretty good read.

Yes, it's a pain to use multiple apps, something JD is promising to solve. But I've never seen anyone use JD regularly. Yes, I've also logged in once, maybe a few years ago and found it severely lacking in comparison to google, and left it.

Next comes the part about Financing. I think that JD is charging businesses to list themselves, but why would anyone pay? The app has a very small user base I recon.

Business/Finance,Some Gyan for aspiring MBA students about which no one will bother to talk,65,84vvjc,Tam-Brahm,81,"I am 2013 MBA pass out. 

I am surprised to see so much misplaced expectations and ignorance among MBA aspirants.

I am currently working as a researcher at a think tank that evaluates quality of management education.

So, according to me, here is some general gyan -

Unless you are from top 25 B School in India, your MBA / PGDM is absolutely worthless job wise.

Private B Schools ranked outside rank 25, are only interested in your ""money"". 

Students joining outside 25 rank Private B Schools will face these hardships -

(1) Placement process will be non-transparent, skewed to benefit favorites of the institute, very few good companies.

(2) Lack of summer placements. 

(3) Some even fudge their placement figures.

(4) Average salary declared is almost always untrue.

(5) 100% placement never happens.

(6) Favoritism based on chamcha giri is rampant, you will get better grades/placement based on that.

(7) You will come across relatives or friends of the founder of the private B School posing as ""Faculty"". 

(8) Alumni networking will be non-existent. 

Also, Business Analytics is a new MBA major specialization being offered with traditional Finance/Marketing/HR.

As valuator I have been holding approved licence from other competent authority of India too.

I am Diploma Automobile, post diploma in sales management, B Tech (Mech), MBA Finance, Fellow IIISLA, Alternate dispute resolution and other professional qualifications also. I have my own proprietorship company and having office in prime location of Ahmedabad city of India. As a surveyor we get the allotment of work from insurers. As valuator we generally get the valuation work from banking sector, NBFC etc for refinance purpose of assets like cars, commercial vehicles, Engineering equipment, plant & machineries, earth movers, mining equipment etc.   

Looking to the current scenario of India-Ahmedabad. it seems that the some of the issues like inflation, population, traffic, pollution, reservation, parking issues etc are never going to be solved. They are being increased day by day. India has become of 130 cr. Mentality of certain class people are on too below level and we feel that it is never going to be changed. Business scenario is also being deteriorated due drastic and impractical changes in government policy. Political leaders are minting their own except few. As per international media India is growing but as per my experience picture of actual India is different.

For last 3 years l have been getting job offer from Canada. In 2016 from Alberta and in 2017 from British Columbia etc. I was not sincere about these offers. Taking in a view the worth uses of qualifications, experience and Looking further for better future of my sons I think sincerely this time. The offer is from St john- New Brunswick.

New Bruns wick is an Atlantic province out of total 4 provinces. St john have population of 7.50 lacs approximately. The population have been deviated in last 4 years due to some unknown reasons. I have been offered 60,00 Canadian Dollar per annum from General Insurance company of St John- New Brunswick Canada.  I will be deputed at St John only. I assume that the offer is via authentic consultant of Canada. It is to be noted that nothing is written as off now. I will have to sign the bond for 2 years for the job of said company.  As per my knowledge job profile in st john is same as India. 

The role will be as collision surveyor that is my core competence.   
I have following queries:

01.At the age of 50 is it worth ACCEPTING offer???


02. Dollar 60,000 is suitable amount or I should negotiate? If alone or with family?? Dependent are wife + 15-year old son.


03. Currently I will be offered a work permit. I will be able to file P.R. after 6 months i.e. for me, my wife and my 15 years old son. The compulsory stay required in N.B. is 1000 days for getting Permanent Residence.  Are these the information appropriate???


04. What may be the expenses to be borne by us i.e. visa fees, any other fees etc.??


05. It is very difficult to adjust with cold weather of st john. Due to health issue related to weather, if we are not able to stay there after 2-3 months than how bond will be executed???

06. I will have to leave my social life, family life, business and some notional benefits too. What can be the advantage of Canada if I accept the offer.


07. Are any specialised engineering study institutes/universities being there for part time study??


08. Is the No objection certificate from wife is required as a part of process if proceeding alone for few months??? Or they demand it as extra security??


09. My son is studying in 10th Standard. Is it advisable to complete study up to 12th in India or he should study there?  

10. Is Indian food available in St-John N.B.???


11. Are there any other provisions to get the P. R. earlier??


12 My elder son is of 22 years. How can I sponsor him other than student Visa?

Business/Finance,"Law graduates of r/India, My close friend (cancer survivor), plans to do LLB this year. He is 36 years old. Is there any merit to his decision ?",69,86kq7c,Tam-Brahm,67,"Hi,

A big thank you to all good Samaritans of r/India for their advice and feedback.

I am the ""friend"" mentioned in the original post.

My friend has given me access to this reddit account after seeing the response.

I experienced outright rejection during my recent MBA entry level job interviews due to my situation.

I was depressed, angry and confused about my future.

I was very skeptical if r/India could really help me out with my situation.

But all your feedback and suggestions, have given me a new hope.

**Original Post by my friend:**

Law graduates of r/India, Please share your views on this :

My close friend is a cancer survivor.

He is 36 years old. 

He has these two career options in mind -

(1) Whether he should get back into IT industry as he has 4.5 year's of coding experience in C#. If yes, what steps.

and

(2) Whether to pursue law as his MBA Finance has given him good exposure to Mergers And Acquisitions (M&A),  Business laws and Taxation.

I am asking your help/advice/suggestion for Query No (2) i.e, He wants to study law at the age of 36 years.

He is appearing for these law exams in 2018 -

CLAT, IIT-Kharapur's LLB entrance exam and DU LLB exam.

He says that there is no age limit for studying law and practicing law. 

Is there any merit to it ? (I don't know anything about careers after law education.)

His family supports him wholeheartedly, but they need clarity on how exactly can pursuing LLB law education help my friend at the age of 36.

Please, Please upvote for visibility.

Edit:

Being a cancer survivor, my friend was unemployed close to 3-4 years during his cancer treatment.

Recently, he secured a part time decent teaching job that can become full time.

His family is unhappy that he will resign from his present job, which he secured through lots of effort against all odds.

So, Is there any merit in his decision to take up law education at this age.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/86kq7c/law_graduates_of_rindia_my_close_friend_cancer/

Business/Finance,"Suddenly, ‘one nation, one policy’ sentiment is overtaking other models -Interview with YV Reddy, IAS, former RBI Governor and 14th Finance Commission Chairman",6,azoh6g,Avinash_Sharma,3,"You have said in your book that there is a feeling in some quarters that cooperative federalism is being replaced with coercive federalism. What is the basis for this comment?

>Some developments have taken place after the 14th Finance Commission’s (FC) recommendations. Cesses and surcharge have increased significantly, even after GST. The States felt that they were being short-changed by the way the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) were restructured, increasing the share that the State government has to put in and then the way the GST is being administered. The general debate earlier was about the Bihar model competing with the Gujarat model and different States’ models of development competing with each other.

>Now, suddenly the “one nation, one policy” sentiment is overtaking the other models. And the Planning Commission, which was a forum for States, is also not there now.

>Due to this institutional vacuum, Ministries are directly dealing with CSS. So, the spirit of discussion and dialogue is being replaced by diktats by various Ministries. Some say that there is no dialogue, which is untypical of cooperative federalism.

You’ve said that States are now forced to share more from their own resources in CSS. After your own 14th FC recommendations, the impression was that the Centre was devolving more to the States as it went up from 32% to 42%.

>As my co-author G.R. Reddy will explain, the comparison is not between 32% and 42%; what was 39% became 42%, because of the way the computations differed. This increase was more than offset by the other actions on cesses and surcharges and CSS. So there has been virtually no advantage for the States

>G.R. Reddy: The 14th FC considered the entire revenue account. Unlike the previous FCs, it considered even the Plan revenue account. As a result, some of the Plan transfers were subsumed under tax devolution.

>The difference between 14th FC and others is that the former did away with sector specific grants that amount to 4-5% of the total devolution. If you take these two together, the actual devolution would have been 39% earlier and that became 42%. Even this 3% increase is not very visible because it has been more than neutralised by the Centre. The reality is that it has increased the matching contribution of the States in CSS and done away with 6000 model schools started in 2011; half way through, in 2015-16, it took a decision to terminate the entire scheme of model schools.

>The entire burden of running schools and meeting expenditure – both capital and operational expenditure, has now fallen on the States.

>They then restructured 66 CSS into 22 umbrella schemes. So there is no change in the number of CSS schemes. All components have remained the same.

Why didn’t States raise the issue?

>We have done so before the 15Th FC… and communicated to the Centre that what they had done was not correct.

>Immediately after the 14th FC recommendations were accepted, the Hon Prime Minister wrote to us saying ‘now that the States are flush with funds…’, We wrote back saying there is absolutely no increase in the flow of funds to the States, but only a change in the composition of transfers in favour of untied transfers. Now what has happened is there has been a qualitative change in the transfers to States – we are getting more money through untied transfers.

>The total transfers as a percentage of gross revenues to the States from the Centre has remained at the same level – 49%.

Aren’t untied transfers desirable? It frees States to use funds for whatever purpose they deem fit…

>Whatever additional money to have come through untied transfers is now tied up towards meeting the additional commitment.

>In the revised pattern of CSS, you have to put in more money.

>You have made a commitment, you can’t ‘uncommit’. But they have changed the pattern. Whatever untied funds you have got, you put in those schemes.

>For example, in 2014, Telangana’s contribution to the CSS was around ₹2,000 crore. In 2015-16, because of the change in funding patterns, it has gone up to ₹3,500 crore. So there is additional commitment on the part of the States.

>There is further commitment for States, because of termination of some CSS – the model schools scheme is an example. Another is BRGF – backward regions grant fund - for Telangana State, 9 of the then 10 districts were under the BRGF. They substantially reduced allocations under women and child welfare also.

>There is a view that there are just too many CSS – money is not efficiently used

>The other concern with CSS is that the money is too thinly spread across schemes. For example, if you take education or health, States are spending close to 80%. The Centre is supplementing the States up to only 20%, which does not make much difference. That too comes with conditionalities, submission of uses, visits of Central teams, delays in release of funds. As a result of these procedures, we are unable to fully utilise the Centre’s allocations. I don’t think any State has used the funds from Centre entirely.

So the solution is to offer funds and allow States a free hand?

>The Commission under Dr. Reddy recommended the same – that the number of CSS should be restricted to some nationally identified priorities.

>Dr. Y.V. Reddy: Basic issue is that Finance Commission is one mechanism which essentially is meant for sharing of taxes and that is based on a formula. 80-90% of transfers to States has always been on tax devolution. In tax devolution, there are no conditions, how much weight you give for population, which census’ population and other consideration namely as fiscal capacity. The only question there is what weight you give. If you give weight equally for efficiency and equity, they cancel out, in some sense.

You mentioned institutional vacuum. Do you think NITI Aayog has not been able to step up to the plate?

>There were some deficiencies in the way the Planning Commission functioned. There was an impression given to the States that they had to go to the Commission as a supplicant but not for discussion. That was its weakness which had to be corrected. In the correction process, that bad habit was got rid of but there was no new system. There is no forum now. Each Ministry has become an authority unto itself and is able to dictate terms to the States.

Is it deliberate that the Aayog does not have power or did it evolve thus?

>That is a question mark. Whether it was by design or by default, the result is that the individual Ministries are indicating to the States, which means there is no coherent and comprehensive view of the States in the process.

There is a view that some of the terms of reference of the 15th FC may not stand the test of constitutional validity. What’s your view?

>There are 3-4 issues. It is true that it generated unprecedented reaction. Never before for an FC have a number of CMs got together and protested. Also, some scholars questioned the constitutional validity of some Terms of Reference – for example, whether there is need for revenue deficit.

>The constitution provides for it and each FC needs to decide on this. Third, the 15th FC has been asked to review the 14th FC. It is a continuing process. Above all, the Commission has been asked to make recommendations keeping in view some performance indicators and that States should conform to certain policy parameters, which reflected the existing policy of the Centre.

>The way the FC is structured, it is not supposed to be an instrument of the central government’s priorities of the day. So it has been questioned on several grounds.

>Most of the considerations mentioned in the ToR are not necessarily binding on the FC. The Commission can choose to or choose not to take these into account. But it needs courage and vision for the Commission to do so – we are hoping that will be there.

What’s your view on the controversy over the base date of population census in the 15th FC?

>The whole question is whether it is a correct thing or not. It is difficult to defend outdated population as the basis. Because the FC is supposed to take into account the needs of the State for the period. How can 1971 population determine the needs of the State in 2021? It was undertaken on the grounds that States should not be penalised. But what about States that have taken action on family planning after 1971? They don’t get anything. It should be a continuing incentive, right?

>This time, they prescribed 2011 population. That is also not valid. The FC recommendations are from 2020. So you should have estimated population of the States for the period 2020-2025. Ideally, there should be no stipulation of a date for population and should be left to the FC but if at all, one should have the population relevant for the period.

Isn’t GST a good example of cooperative fiscal federalism?

>It is an extraordinary institution and is commendable. It did not come into existence overnight. It started as an informal committee in the Finance Ministry and has evolved. In the implementation, there has been dissatisfaction expressed. The fact that the Centre has a veto increases its influence. But that is part of the game. Concerns may be there in the way it is working. But as an institutional set up, it is extraordinarily good. It is a good example of collaboration and cooperation in an institution between the Union and the States.

Can this be replicated in other areas?

>Exactly. This is on the revenue side. On the expenditure side, fiscal transfers outside the FC, it can be brought under some inter-State council. That was the recommendation of the 14th FC.

>The GST Council may not be replicated but is a good approach to build on. On the expenditure side, it is a different type of collaboration, compared to the revenue side.

Is that a recommendation that the 15th FC can give?

>Yes. The transfers to the States from the Centre can take FC and non-FC routes. The 14th FC gave recommendations on how to structure the non-FC transfers. It’s only in the ambit of advice.

>There are three approaches: virtually abolish the Commission by making a constitutional amendment and say this will be the percentage; the second is to have a continuous FC, a GST Council type of mechanism but the FC gets subsumed in this; the third is to have the FC and a design of new institutional arrangements which will be more technical, more political and more consensus-based, as recommended by the 14th FC.

>All this is provoked partly because of the GST Council which has been positive and partly because of the institutional vacuum — both these are pushing us to find new institutional mechanisms.

Pleasantly surprised at the functioning of the GST Council. It comprises people with varying vote bank compulsions.

>The consensus has been the result of number of years of effort. Consultative process has been going on for the last 10-15 years. States also are convinced that it is a win-win situation, for the sake of tax harmonisation across the country, they felt it was better. And there was also the feeling that GST is a better form of tax, leading to better compliance. It builds up a value chain. Initially, there was some apprehension on part of manufacturing States that they may lose out this being a destination tax. So we have put in place a 2 year statutory mechanism that they will be compensated for a period of 5 years. The states have yielded lot more space than the Centre. For States, VAT constituted about 60% of their old tax revenue. They have conceded 50% of their fiscal space to the Centre, whereas the space conceded by the Centre is only 30%. They still get customs duty, income tax etc. In the working, there is still a trust deficit because the voting pattern is fully loaded in favour of the Centre, which has almost a veto power.

>Then, the way the GST is administered is also raising apprehensions in the minds of the people that they are not being treated fairly by the Centre. Like delays in apportionment of IGST, delays in payment of compensation cess, collecting more compensation cess than required. Best thing to do is to reduce compensation cess correspondingly that they are not doing. So there is surplus compensation cess lying with the Centre to be distributed after 5 years. It is for the Centre to set the record straight and remove this trust deficit.

On the special category status for Andhra Pradesh, what was the stand that you took in the 14th FC?

>Special category status is not under the jurisdiction of any FC. In my book, I have explained the Centre’s version of the relationship between 14th FC recommendation and the special category.

>If you want the simple truth, 14th FC did not make any recommendation on inclusion or exclusion of special category. The issue of according special category status and assurance by the PM was given months before the 14th FC could give recommendations.

>But the government has its own explanation as to why it interprets the recommendations of 14th FC with regard to special category status. I have given that in the book. It is for the reader to decide why and how these are related.

Cess is becoming a monster in the administrative system. With GST we assumed that cess won’t any longer be a part of the system. But with Kerala, we have a disaster cess. Isn’t the purpose of a reform lost with such acts?

>There is a calamity fund and the Centre is expected to come to the assistance of states when such things happen and there is always a burden sharing, you can’t anticipate this. Now the recourse to cess for such things is unusual.

Isnt this a step away from cooperative fiscal federalism? The Council is telling one state that funds needed for rebuilding after a disaster are to be generated from within that State...

>That is why some of them are dissenting calling it coercive federalism. These are ‘innovations’ that some States are uncomfortable with.

You have Kerala at the upper end of the social development scale and Uttarakhand at the lower end; T.N., Gujarat and Maharashtra at the higher end of the economic development index with Odisha and Bihar at the other. How is it possible for any central body, including the FC to reconcile these differences?

>That is exactly the issue with regard to any federation. In any federation there are competing considerations. You have to build trust amongst yourselves so therefore there is no fixed formula. That’s how you operate the system.

>What is needed is for the Centre to be able to bring together the States and treat these inequalities or calamities as a national problem in which both Union and States participate. Problem now is that whenever a State opposes the Centre it is accused of being anti-national. Being anti-union is not anti-national.

>There are 3 levels of debate – State interest, Union interest, national interest. To build a national consensus, the Union and States must be together. If the States get the feeling that the Union has abrogated to itself the sole authority of national interest, the States resent it. That is the essence of the matter.

How much is this because of a strong leader at the top?

>You should go back to Constituent Assembly debates. Dr Ambedkar when introducing the draft constitution, discusses the merits and demerits of parliamentary and presidential form of government and says why parliamentary system is important for India. He says that India is essentially undemocratic and therefore emphasises on continuous accountability. He says continuous accountability is more important than stability. That was the deliberate choice on this type of issue.

In 14th FC, you recommended forest cover as a determinant. In the five years that have lapsed, have you studied how that recommendation has helped India’s environment cause?

>No. But it’s an interesting area where we have to see the impact of the recommendation. But the logic is simple – forest cover. The state govt is contributing to environment at a cost to itself. It cannot use the resource but has to maintain it. So you have to provide for it. The basic principle is externalities. The state is contributing at its own cost – it does not gain anything. It incurs cost to maintain the forest.

Business/Finance,TL;DR – Godman to Tycoon – The Untold Story of Baba Ramdev,546,6s4hoh,rahultheinvader,95,"Context – Yesterday in a thread I happened to mention reading this book and a few redditors had suggested doing a TL;DR of the book once I am finished. 

On the onset if you have the time and resources, I would highly recommend reading the book. It’s published by Juggernaut and is available for reading on their app at Rs. 80. I have read a few biographies and they can often go either way. This is one of few good biographies I have read, partly due to the Caravan Magazine style free flow writing rather than meandering on author’s perceptions and also because the subject (Baba Ramdev) is a fascinating and an intriguing person. It took me three days and essentially three sittings to complete it. The author – Priyanka Pathak Narain is a journalist who used to cover the religion and spirituality section for Mint and that is where she begins on this journey. As part of the book she has interviewed over 52 subjects including Balakrishna – Ramdev’s deputy and owner of 94% of shares of Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd. 

So here we go

* Baba Ramdev (Ram Kisan Yadav) was born in Said Alipur in a poor farming family. A sickly child he rather became very obese and was a victim to his father’s frequent violent outbursts. 

* Somewhere in his early 20s, he finds a band of Arya Samaj workers and is immediately drawn to them. He joined Khanpur gurukul where he learnt Sanskrit grammar, tended cows, collected alms and met his future deputy-to-be Acharya Balakrishna

* Balakrishna is quite into Ayurveda and is from Haridwar where he befriends **Acharya Karamveer** – a stoic, soft spoken Arya Samaj member who had three post graduate degrees in Yoga, Indian Philosophy and Vedas. Karamveer soon takes Balakrishna under his wing and soon Ramdev joins them after a controversy.

* Ramdev learns yoga from Karamveer. To propagate Yoga to masses they soon take over ownership from **Shankar Dev**, a patron of Kripalu Bagh Ashram at Haridwar. Shankar Dev wants and only trusts Karamveer. But since he is Arya Samaj member he is not just ready to take Sanyas. Sensing an opportunity, Ramdev steps in. Taking Sanyas means two things -  1) He can’t keep any formal relations with his family 2) He cannot maintain any material wealth. I am bringing this up of course because this is very important

* Balakrishna meanwhile sets up Divya Pharmacy using the license of a silent partner, Swami Yogananda. Balakrishna himself from **Nepal** has legal cases against him (still in courst) for forging his high school and other documents to attain a passport.

* In early 2000s, Aastha and Sanskar become household name. The TV guys select Ramdev over Karamveer because - saffron robes means authenticity. **An interesting story here is that after Aastha turned Ramdev down, our diligent Baba went to Sanskar paying Rs 1 Lakh for a twenty minute slot.** This is also where I learnt that channels like Sanskar and Aastha don’t earn from advertising but godmen paying them for TV slots to demonstrate their abilities

* We all now know the story. Ramdev becomes a household name, not only to nauli kriya or churning of the stomach but also his personality, self-depreciating humor and showmanship 

* Soon Ramdev has friends at high places. **Mulayam Singh, ND Tiwari from Congress, Sudarshan Agarwal – ex UP governor.** So when they are charged with Sales Tax fraud, Sudarshan Agarwal mounts immense pressure on Sales Tax Deputy Commissioner to drop the case and retire.

* Ramdev soon brings his extended family who takes over the business. His younger brother Ram Bharat is soon in charge of the finances. This causes rift between Karamveer and Ramdev. Afterall Ramdev shouldn’t have familial relations. So one day, Karamveer just walks out. 

* Swami Yogananda (whose license enabled the setting up of Divya Pharmacy) has a falling out with them. **Soon he is mysteriously knifed to death.** The neighbors are cagey and the case goes unsolved. 

* Enter Rajeev Dixit.  A swadeshi and founder of Azadi Bachao Andolan. Ramdev’s interest in entering politics leads to these two becoming incredibly close much to the discomfort of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat

* Meanwhile, his political favors with the Congress masters reap him reward as he wins contracts of Food Processing Plants. But soon, due to not paying workers at Divya Pharmacy minimum wage they draw the ire of CITU. Brinda Karat soon claims that the workers brought her ‘testicles of some sort of wildcat’. Apparently they told her deer horns and human skulls were crushed into the medicines. Though there is no proof to validate this, the samples tested by the Union Health Ministries’ Ayurvedic unit – AYUSH confirmed traces of human and animal DNA. Karat apparently met N.D Tiwari but according to her the minister didn’t budge to take any action

* Soon Ramdev starts to do roadshows across the country and abroad. Patanjali Ayurved Ltd is born over the controversial Divya Pharmacy. And here we see the next mystery. The disappearance of 77 year old TB infested Shankar Mahadev (Ramdev’s Guru). Mahadev was becoming quite vocal and anxious about the venture of Ramdev and his deputies. Police find nothing but a note in his room saying “I have taken some loan from you for this trust but I cannot pay it. Please forgive me. I am leaving”. Ramdev who was on a foreign trip didn’t cut it short as would have been expected. 

* Ramdev and Rajeev Dixit set up a new party – **Bharat Swabhiman Andolan.** 

* The Takeover of Aastha – When SEBI freezes 93% of Aastha’s owners share, sensing an opportunity Ramdev moves in and buys the remaining 7% for 10 crores in installment. The installments were never paid, but the ownership was transferred to Ramdev. Part of this was done in faith. Once the formalities are done, in a confrontational meeting, Ramdev bullies the owner and MD into resignation. Meanwhile, he asks another follower to buy Sanskar channel for him. Which that follower did.

* As mentioned earlier, keeping inline with Ramdev’s political ambitions, Rajeev Dixit and Ramdev became increasingly close much to dismay of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat. Soon, Rajeev Dixit was found dead in a locked bathroom. The hospital said it was cardiac arrest. Ramdev said on television that he had told Rajeev to take care of his health as he had diabetes, BP and heart disease. But Rajeev’s brother Pradeep says that he had no such health problems. Next, Ramdev convinces the family to conduct funeral in Haridwar as Dixit was son of the soil instead of his native Wardha. But as his body was laid for public demonstration, the Bharat Swabhiman Andolan workers were stunned. Dixit’s face was unrecognizable, strange purple and blue. His skin was peeling strangely. There was black, blue blood coming from his nose. Soon there was hue and cry. The Andolan workers wanted to conduct post mortem. Ramdev called a few of them for a personal meeting, confiscated their phones, checked their pens for cameras and told them that post mortem is against **Hindu Dharma.** When they refused to budge, Ramdev agreed but soon went back to the hall ahead of the workers and spoke on microphone ‘Some people have come from Mumbai. They want me to do a post mortem. Such cutting is against Hindu Dharma’. Soon Ramdev’s men got the body ready and set off to cremation ghats.

* Ramdev’s biggest fall came during his participation in the Anna movement. He wanted to use the movement for his political mileage. Hence while the original protesters were focused on a stronger Lokpal bill, Ramdev was more about bringing black money back. So he sat on a fast onto death protest. Meanwhile there was a backdoor meeting with senior Congress members (Pranab Mukerjee, P.K Bansal, Kapil Sibal and Subodh Kant Sahay). He then agreed to something and then went ahead and did the exact opposite. This ired the Congress as at midnight the cops swooped on the protestors with lathi charge. Ramdev of course famously tried to escape dressed in a **white salwar kameez**

* Part of the credit towards the success of Patanjali should go to their ex-CEO – **S.K Patra**. He helped them lay the foundations, setup best practices for what was a highly disoriented company with no ethics or standard operating procedures. Patra also used his connections to stabilize against the witch-hunting on Ramdev’s business enterprises by the Congress Govt. But soon Patra’s influence once again made Balakrishna and Ram Bharat uneasy. Patra was let off after some ugly confrontation with Baba. 

* Today Patanjali is the second largest FMCG company with revenue of **Rs 10561 crores**. Its best selling products are ghee – **Rs 1467 crore**, Dant Kanti toothpaste – Rs 940 crore. But Patanjali ghee isn’t normal ghee but actually white butter which is not really good for health. Caravan has published a transcript from the book on this section - [Link](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/patanjalis-desi-cow-ghee-even-cow-ghee)

* Part of the reason for Patanjali’s market share is its price. Its below market as Baba believes only in taking a marginal share. But this is also possible because working at Patanjali is considered as **seva** and asking for increments and privileges are frowned upon. Economic Times has published a transcript from the book on this section – [Link](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/inside-patanjali-heres-what-life-is-like-in-baba-ramdevs-company/articleshow/59824892.cms) 

* There are a number of violations flagged by FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) including license number fraudulence on Patanjali noodles. A lot of third party agencies have written about the poor conditions and lack of hygiene in the production units.

Ramdev is a businessman, politician and godman rolled into one. He has no doubt helped popularize Yoga and Ayurveda in India. The people who speak to the author are no doubt captivated, influenced and no doubt bullied by him. His close association with BJP government today means none of the open cases would move anytime soon. His target is to get Patanjali to 20,000 crores by 2018-19. And under the environment of nationalistic and swadeshi assertions he very well might do it. 

Finally, I realise that the TL;DR post itself needs a TL;DR. But its quite hard summarizing a book without loosing on intricacies. Hence once again would recommend reading the book.

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays | March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2 The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4 Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8 During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9 India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12 What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13 It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14 and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16 There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20 If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24 If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25 An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26 But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27 Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32 It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35 David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37 It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

[AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-70-marginal-tax-rate-isnt-that-radical)

When we were born as a republic and our Constitution was being drafted, one of the tallest leaders of the land could foresee the problem we ail with even today. BR Ambedkar warned us about a divide and that divide was not just of caste but of rich and poor. The recent Oxfam Report on Inequality in India is a testament to that. Somewhere along the line we have failed to bridge that divide.

We have progressed, indubitably but failed to progress collectively. Poverty and hunger still ails the weakest among us. I remember watching one video of Raghav Bahl where he mentioned how India, as a mixed economy have actually got the worst of both worlds. Ours is not a **capitalist economy** and even with Indira's 42nd amendment, it isn't a **socialist economy** either.

I am not a Rahul fanboy, I supported Modi and voted for BJP but I concur with Rahul's tweet when he announces MIG and says 'we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers & sisters suffer the scourge of poverty.'

While all this is happening in India, in the west, USA, the Democrats are making a comeback, they have recently won back the House with their diverse bunch of Reps and are putting a leash on their meglomaniac President. The hotly debated topic and the eyesore for Fox News being? AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate on which she campaigned and won and will probably take it forward.

All these three events are happening at the same time and I do not see why we are not having this debate in India. Our divide is only growing and we cannot collectively grow until we take care of the poor and weakened ones. Here is an interesting statistic!

I do understand when you say that Ambani (or other ultra rich people) have notional wealth because it lies in stocks. This is a very capitalistic thought and factually correct but at the same time, incomplete. Ambani's wealth lies in RIL's stocks but, **STOCKS PAY DIVIDENDS**! Ambani, according to [this report](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/mukesh-ambanis-dividend-income-from-reliance-industries-trumps-his-salary), **made Rs 14,553 crore in dividend through his stake in the company over the last 10 years** and  **Rs 1,804 crore in 2018 alone** and that with **a salary of Rs 15 crore annually**.

A rough calculation on Google's currency converter would tell you that **he can finance like two more $100 million weddings with the payout of 2018 ALONE**! So don't talk to me about the concept of notional wealth and how if he starts liquidate, RIL stocks would crash, a common and idiotic argument.

So yeah, we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers and sisters suffer the scourge of poverty and MIG is sure as hell seems a nice idea (not talking about execution right now) and taxing the ultra rich like AOC says cannot be ruled out in India as well. This is India, we have a probe on Mars while we rank 103 of 119 countries in Global Hunger Index, the divide is real.

I am writing down all this because there **needs to be a debate** on this in India as well. The tax plan may just as well be a way to finance UBI or MIG in India but let's talk policy and make a buzz about this.

Lastly, here's a nice tweet from AOC on her idea of income inequality which I absolutely love. [Somewhere between “teachers shouldn’t have to sell their own blood to make rent” & “billionaires with helipads and full-time workers on food stamps shouldn’t exist in the same society”](https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1085293594603339776?lang=en)",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/alx3kj/with_the_recent_oxfam_india_inequality_report/

Business/Finance,We really need to talk about Flairs.,104,6bacbg,root_su,133,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/
Business/Finance,[RANT] SBI worker blames me for faulty transactions even though plenty of their customers are getting scammed,52,7yvec1,anonyfried,59,"I received a message today about being credited with some 12k on my SBI account which confused me. Checked my online SBI account and realised that a week back some Google Octro had made a transaction of that 12k from my account which I had not realised. A simple google search showed that a lot of SBI customers were also complaining about this Google Octro thing (also found a TOI article on it). Its an App on the Google Play store from what I understood. But never mind that, I was just thankful I got my money back. However, a quick advice from my father was to close my SBI account because the Octro company may still have my account details and such, so there might be a risk of such fraudulent or faulty or whatever transactions to occur again. I've never taken the time to manage my finances or understand how fraud transactions work so this part is probably my fault because I realised a week late that 12k was even missing from my account in the first place. So I went to the bank to close my account and maybe create a new account after that.

Now I am not confrontational, and I even see my faults in the whole thing. But the man behind the desk was a whole different story. When I went and old him I'd like to close my account, he looked up the statement of my transactions. And I pointed out the faulty ones and he started blaming me for those.

He used a shitty ass analogy and I quote ""if a pick pocket steals from a person and the person doesn't realise then the blame lies on the person for not realising."" Yea right the pickpocket is the angel here for stealing from a man carrying a wallet. What the fuck is this victim blaming nonsense?? 

He told me I can't blame the bank for not realising I lost money. Except I didn't even blame the bank. I only told him I wanted to close my account and gave him the reason when he asked why??

And then I told him I have been busy with things plus my card was with my parents too during that time so I didn't properly check my account frequently and I realise that its my fault. And then he was like ""of course its your fault. Computer won't make mistakes it'll only do what its told, so if there was a mistake in telling it what to do then you should've realised and complained."" 

And then the icing on the cake was that he went on ""You youngsters are on the phone the whole day doing WhatsApp yet you didn't check the transaction message. I know you people are always looking at your phone and message toh aaya hi hoga. Tumhi ne nahi dekha."" All this after I explained that I know it was my fault that I didn't realise.

Why are office workers in India so rude? This may seem like a small thing for many of you but I hate confrontation and avoid it as much as possible. I even admitted the blame on my part and I didn't even lodge a complaint or anything but they still decide to aggressively blame and mock me for being irresponsible? lol and SBI is definitely not at all at fault even though plenty of their customers had actually suffered cause of this Google Octro fiasco.

My experience with SBI so far had been pretty decent until this incident. But now I'm just going to go ahead and get my account closed and move to another bank.

tl:dr SBI account had fraudulent transaction, got blamed for being irresponsible",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7yvec1/rant_sbi_worker_blames_me_for_faulty_transactions/

Business/Finance,India and its States: some states are too much populated to govern efficiently,8,9zgjc8,bikbar1,4,"Hello everyone, let's discuss about our states. We all know that some of our states are too populated to govern efficiently. However, creation of so many smaller states is very difficult. So, we need Autonomous Regions (AR).

For example, UP has close to 200 million people. There are only four countries on earth with more population than UP ! Even Maharashtra and Bihar had 100 million plus people in 2011. West Bengal had more than 91 million in 2011 too. There are only 13 countries on earth with 100 million club. The US state with highest population is California (39 mil), we have 11 states with more than that.

So, it seems that for better serving the populace we need states with lesser population. State governments tend to keep all power in the hands of a select few leaders and thus failed to spread development evenly around the state.

However, dividing our states into smaller one would be very problematic. It would create political shit storms and turmoils so powerful that no central government would withstand that. Just see what happened during the creation of Telengana. 

So, the better solution would be dividing states into semi-autonomous regions. There are 14 such regions already exist in India like Gorkhaland, Bodoland, Kargil, Ladakh etc.

Bigger states should be divided into a few autonomous regions (AR). It would have its own local governments with limited powers.

The AR's could be like that:

1) Population below 10 millions except the Metropolis AR's like Mumbai, Kolkata etc.

2) The local government of the AR should be formed via Panchayet and Municipal elections by their elected members. Another extra election should be avoided.

3) These AR's should have powers and funds for village and town developments, local road constructions, sanitations, health cares, school education, waterbody and forest conservation, tourism development, industrial developments, land and land reforms etc.

4) The state government will control the police, judiciary, state civil services, higher educational institutions, state highways etc.

5) The state government and the central agencies will collect the taxes. The ARs would collect some local taxes like tolls, small business license fees etc. The tax revenues would be distributed among the AR's, state governments and the central government by the rules of the finance commissions.

6) The AR's would have limited legislative powers which would enables them to pass some laws. However, they would be under the legislative authority of the state.

7) So, there could be more than hundreds of such AR. Every metro city city should form its own AR.

Let's debate.

Business/Finance,No Progress on the Panama Papers! Despite over 1800 Indian Names Disclosed!,257,63lhl9,modiusoperandi,77,"NO PROGRESS ON THE PANAMA PAPERS. OVER 1800 INDIAN NAMES HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED.

""The Panama Papers illuminate a key aspect of why the system isn’t working–because globalization has allowed the capital and assets of the 1 % (be they individuals or corporations) to travel freely, while those of the 99 % cannot.

Globalization is supposed to be about the free movement of people, goods, and capital. But in fact, the system is set up to enable that mobility mainly for the rich (or for large corporations).

The result is global tax evasion, the offshoring of labor, and an elite that flies 35,000 feet over the problems of nation states and the tax payers within them.""


PANAMA: No questions asked!

The ways of India’s rich and famous are increasingly becoming public knowledge. The disclosure that as many as five hundred prominent Indian’s, including Incredible India’s latest brand ambassador - Amitabh Bachchan, owned offshore companies in Panama is just the latest of the unraveling. All one can say is that he is in the good company of the likes of Vladimir Putin, David Cameron and Nawaz Sharif among others.

Panama is a small sliver of a country in Central America joining North and South America. Its immediate geographical neighbors are Costa Rica in the north and Colombia in the south. It is the narrow isthmus that separates the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. A 77 kilometers long manmade canal capable of accommodating large ships joins the two oceans. The revenues from this were for long the nations biggest source of income since the canal opened in 1914.

Panama soon found that becoming a tax haven that assured investors of their privacy provided a more lucrative income. The proximity to the Americas, and the balmy Caribbean islands, and countries like Colombia with its huge cocaine production and export business, and Latin America’s many kleptomaniac tin pot dictators made Panama even more attractive. Till not long ago the Canal Zone was under the protection of US troops and that too served as an incentive for Americans seeking an offshore tax haven.

Panama is a tax haven, which means it is a country that offers foreign individuals and businesses little or no tax liability in a fairly politically and economically stable environment. Tax havens also provide little or no financial information to foreign tax authorities. This in short is the reason Panama is so important to our moneyed people who have good reason to hide their real wealth.

Why do the rich then want to hide their wealth? This is simply because officially they are not as wealthy as they really are. And if they honestly declared their true wealth they would not only be liable to pay more income tax but could also open many of them to various charges of corporate fraud and malfeasances that could earn them hefty prison terms.
To comprehend this one must understand how most of our “captains of industry” many of whom sit on the Prime Ministers Council of Trade and Industry became rich and powerful?

When an “industrialist” launches a new project, the project costs are usually hugely overstated. The suppliers of plant and machinery then pay the promoter kickbacks, which become the promoter capital. Thus, the more the number of projects an individual promotes the wealthier he or she becomes. But it is not income you can declare. So it gets hidden in a tax haven. This is how the big bucks are made and salted away.

A good part of this money is round tripped back to India via nearby tax havens like Mauritius or Singapore. Not surprisingly in 2015 the top FDI investing countries were Mauritius (27%) and Singapore (21%). Both are now the home of hundreds of corporate entities that act as a pass through for funds being held overseas for Indians or Indian entities. These countries are little more than cutouts for monies held in other more distant tax havens like Panama, Cayman Islands, Bermuda and Lichtenstein. The smaller the country the more pliable the officials.

The fourteen PSU banks control almost 80% of the commercial credit advanced in India. In addition the government also owns the two big project finance institutions, IDBI and IFCI, and large institutional investors like LIC and general insurance companies like Oriental and GIC. The state ownership of these, with powers vested with the powers that be in New Delhi, political and bureaucratic, ensures that the projects are suitably “gold plated” without any rigorous scrutiny. And why scrutinize when projects seldom fold up and in a system where restructuring means lending more money to evergreen the loans?

The list of NPA’s includes almost the entire roster of top Indian companies. As of June 2016, the total amount of Gross Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) for public and private sector banks is around Rs. 6 lakh crore. The NPA figures along with total debt for each of the 49 public and private sector banks were shared by the Ministry of Finance in response to a Parliament question. According to RBI estimates, the top 30 loan defaulters currently account for one-third of the total gross NPA’s of PSU banks. Till March 31, 2015, the country’s top five PSU banks had outstandings of Rs 4.87 lakh crore to just 44 borrowers, if borrowers were to be categorized in terms of those having outstandings of over Rs 5,000 crore. These businesses include Essar, Reliance ADAG, Jaiprakash Associates, Adani's, GVK, GMR and Lanco. Some of them like Essar have defaulted in the before. This stress problem is fairly endemic.

Of the big companies or groups only Tata’s, Reliance Industries and AV Birla can be considered free of financial stress. Most if not all the money earned by gold plating plant and machinery, under invoicing of exports and over invoicing of imports is retained abroad. Has anyone wondered why the UAE is the second largest destination of India’s merchandise exports ($33 billion in 2015) and third largest source of merchandise imports ($26.2 billion in 2015)?

The UAE is also the largest source of legal and illicitly imported gold. Last year India officially imported over 900 tons of gold worth $35 billion. The mysteriously owned corporations incorporated in tax havens like Panama mostly finance these exports. And a good part of the illicitly exported gold also.

According to Global Financial Integrity, a Washington DC based think-tank; Indians were estimated to have illicitly sent out $83 billion in 2015. Where does this money go? Countries like Switzerland that offer banking secrecy usually do not pay any interest on such deposits. So money goes to corporations in tax havens from where they are invested in businesses world over. Have you ever wondered how many of our top businessmen have managed to become so big overseas so soon?
This is where the Panama’s of the world come in. 

There was a time when Panama in India was synonymous with a cheap brand of cigarettes manufactured by the Dalmia Golden Tobacco Company. In the West, Panama was a man's wide-brimmed straw hat made from the leaves of the Toquilla tropical palm tree. That Panama too is now forgotten. Now Panama is synonymous with offshore corporations and assured secrecy. The times have changed.

**Faulty Basic Assumptions:**

A look at the JP¥ - IN₹ exchange rate over [the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/NcmqjkW) is fluctuating around ₹0.6 for JP¥1, for the most part. Here's a longer and more detailed view of the [last decade](https://imgur.com/tOxvgAM). While there are spikes and lows, the average seems to be sticking to around 0.6 Rupees per Yen. 

While Japan's Inflation Rate trend graph is certainly quite flat when averaged over the last decade or so, and the average remains near-zero, India's inflation rate has been trending downwards over the past decade, and has [accelerated downwards over the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/SoCXbPi).

The author seems to correlate the difference in inflation with the exchange rate, but the two are not actually linked directly. For instance, India's inflation rates for the years 2009 and 2010 were steep, at 14.97% and 9.47% respectively. During the same years, Japan's inflation rates were -1.67% and -0.40% respectively. The Yen actually *increased* in value, while the Rupee *dropped* in value, within their respective domestic markets. Yet the [exchange rate from January 2009 till January 2011 (the same 2 full years)](https://imgur.com/DHgubGX) remained relatively steady, somewhere between 0.485 - 0.550, on average, a range of about 0.065. One would expect to see a massive increase in the exchange rate, with one yen being able to buy *significantly more rupees*. But that was not the case. So the value of a currency on international markets has little to do with the domestically-perceived inflation in the country.

>Another factor to be considered is that while an interest rate of 0.1% may appear free from an Indian perspective, it is not so in Japan.

Has the author even considered that there are scenarios that are win-win? That economics is not a zero-sum game? This deal should be great for Japan. It can also be good for India. 

###So since the author was a lazy schmuck, here's the actual math:

We are currently getting Japan to invest USD 17 Billion in the project.

Since the author is concerned with exchange rates, that's JP¥ 1.89 trillion . Which is currently ₹ 1.09 trillion. 

^(Note: While writing this, I used figures like JP¥ 1.892 tr and ₹ 1.093 tr for my calculations, but rounded that last digit off while editing the text, in order to avoid visual confusion with the 4-digit years like 1967, 2067, etc. So the calculation is more precise than it looks.)

Over 50 years at 0.1% interest rates, the amount payable (at the end of 2067) would be JP¥ 1.99 trillion. If the current exchange rate were to remain constant, that would be ₹ 1.15 trillion. But assuming the *peak* exchange-rate in the last 10 years (ie: 0.71872 - July 2012), India would be repaying about ₹ 1.43 trillion. That's *STILL* an interest rate of less than 0.54%, assuming they had loaned us the entire amount in Rupees, instead of Yen.

So effectively, worst case scenario, **we got a loan of a trillion rupees, for 50 years, at a 0.5% interest rate.**

###Now here's where the author's argument (and lack of math) is turned on its' head:

Assuming 0% inflation in Japan, the value of that currency when repaid in Yen will be *equally* valuable in 50 years, as it would be if we paid all JP¥ 1.99 trillion upfront. So they aren't losing anything but time. That's great for them.

But seeing how India's inflation is assumed to be significantly above 0%, the value of the ₹ 1.43 trillion repayment amount in 2067 will actually be *lower*, as perceived within India. Remember, domestic inflation doesn't translate directly into exchange rates. So even if the Yen-Rupee exchange rate becomes horribly high, the domestic inflation would actually *cushion* the sum we would have to pay. 

###Still don't get it? Okay try this: 

Here's a real-life example using real data from the past:

* I used [this link for the calculation of exchange rate](http://fxtop.com/en/currency-converter-past.php?A=1093&C1=JPY&C2=INR&DD=01&MM=01&YYYY=1967&B=1&P=&I=1&btnOK=Go%21)
* I used [this link to calculate inflation](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Let's forget the 'trillions' for simplicity.

Say your Grandpa took a loan of JP¥ 1,892.00, 50 years ago (1967), at 0.1% interest rate, the value of it in Rupees was ₹ 39.42. Today you need to repay the loan as it has been 50 years. You need to pay back JP¥ 1,989.00. According the the present exchange-rate, that comes to ₹ 1,156.00.

Now, back in Grandpa's day, ₹ 1,156 was a lot of money. You could easily pay the rent for 2 months with just ₹ 100. In 1967, ₹ 100 was the average monthly salary in India. ₹ 1,156 would have been nearly **a full year's salary**, back then. Today, ₹ 1,156 is what you pay for 2 large pizzas. In 1967, a Coke was for ₹ 0.05, meaning you could buy 23,120 bottles of Coke with ₹ 1,156. Today, you can buy only 115 bottles of Coke with that amount (the original small glass bottles at that). India experienced a cumulative inflation of ~4000% over the last 50 years. Paying back ₹ 1,156 today, feels the equivalent of [paying back ₹ 30.25 back in 1967](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=30.25&C1=INR&INDICE=INCPI1958&DD1=18&MM1=09&YYYY1=1967&DD2=19&MM2=09&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Meanwhile in Japan, the value of JP¥ 1,989.00 today has only dropped to a third of its' 1967 value ([worth about JP¥ 620.00 of the time](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value)). Japan experienced relatively tiny cumulative inflation of 224% over 50 years.

So your Grandpa paid off a month's rent in 1967, and only had to buy the Japanese lender 2 pizzas 50 years later? And the Japanese lender actually lost money in the process? Huh. Guess that's why interest rates are higher in currencies that have higher inflation rates.

Now obviously, if the author is right, and Japan's inflation remains a flat 0% for the next 50 years, then Japan certainly won't lose any money on this deal. Which is excellent for them! However, it still means that India, with a non-negative inflation rate, will actually be coming out on top, as long as the currency exchange doesn't go absolutely berserk. 

###Assuming a 3% inflation rate, when we pay back ₹ 1.43 Trillion in 2067, it will be as if we were paying back only ₹ 0.326 Trillion (in today's terms). 

^(*assuming the peak conversion rate of the past 10 years: JP¥ - IN₹ 0.71872, which is a worst-case scenario*)

This is because ₹ 1.4 trillion will have far less perceived value (domestically) in 2067, than it does in 2017. 

Put another way, if we take ₹ 326 Billion today, and invest it in a *reaaaalllyyy* shitty-ass mutual fund that only yields 3% interest (that's impossibly pathetic, seriously), then in 50 years, it will easily pay off our 'loan' of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

If you're using a Fixed Deposit scheme that gives 7% interest per annum, **you will only need to invest ₹ 49 Billion.** [Try it for yourself here](http://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php)

So... take this loan of ₹ 1.09 trillion, and put ₹ 49 Billion aside in the 7% fixed deposit account, and use the balance ₹ 1.04 trillion as you see fit... hire strippers, or invest in solar power plants, or build a railway with it. What do you call 1.04 trillion bucks that you can do with as you see fit without needing to pay it back? You call it free money. Obviously, the more wisely you invest it, the better the outcomes will be. But yes, it's effectively free. 

Now, mind you, we aren't getting it as cash, but we *are* getting it as a solid investment that will generate revenue (and pay off its' own dues) and will have further positive externalities (employment, new skills and training, tech-transfer, economic growth of connected areas, increased urbanization, reduced environmental impact, reduced accidents, lower congestion, etc). It will also leave a lot of the money in government coffers available for more investment into other projects over the next few decades, many of which should see some decent returns on investment over the next 5 decades.

Yes, Japan comes out a winner in the deal, ***and so does India!*** The higher our domestic inflation, the cheaper our repayment will seem. Just like Grandpa's ₹ 1156 seems like such a paltry amount, when seen from 50 years later. Obviously we don't want the inflation to be too high, but having a sub-4% inflation rate will keep our economy healthy, while reducing the burden on future taxpayers in paying off this big 'loan'.

This, btw, is the reason you should invest your money and ensure that it gives returns of **at least** 5-7% per annum, in order to beat inflation. Because otherwise, sitting in a bank account, your money is actually **losing** value over time.

###But wait! There's more:


>The 508km-long Mumbai to Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (MAHSR) is scheduled for completion in December 2023, but commencement date has been sought to be advanced to August 2022.

>Initially, each high speed train will have 10 cars and the capacity to accommodate 750 people, The Times of India said. It will increase to 16 cars that will accommodate 1,200 people.

>According to initial estimates, around 1.6 crore people are expected to travel by the bullet train annually. By 2050, around 1.6 lakh commuters should travel by the high-speed train on a daily basis.

> The fares could be in the range of Rs 3000 - Rs 5,000.

^(Source - http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mostly-elevated-partly-under-sea-all-you-need-to-know-about-mumbai-ahmedabad-bullet-train/story-nzG4ROjD9IRE00FcK4fD7N.html)

They want to complete it in 5-6 years, but let's be conservative and just give it 10 years. Let's assume that the next 10 years has all the construction and the low-volume trains running and then just directly jump to the 1200 capacity trains by 2027, for ease of math. That leaves us 40 years to repay ₹ 1.43 trillion, using only train revenues.

The article claims that 1.6 crore people may travel annually initially (that's 44,000 people per day), but that it'll increase to 1,60,000 people per day by 2050. Basically, they intend to increase capacity to 360% over 40 years. Since capacity isn't something that can increase exponentially, we'll assume a linear growth in capacity, from 44k to 160k. The train completes a single trip in 2.5 hours. Assume 30 minute boarding/de-boarding time on either end, a single train will conservatively make 1 full trip in 3.5 hours. That means that a single train can comfortably make 4 trips in a day (14 hours active duty) leaving 10 hours for maintenance and all that jazz. Meaning one train has the capacity to ferry 4800 people per day.


    160000-44000 = 116000 people: increased capacity over 40 years
    116000/4800 = 24 trains: added capacity over 40 years
    (40*12)/24 = 20 months: the time it takes to add one more train to the system.

Basically: One new 1200-seater train is added every 20 months, for 40 years, after a starter-pack of 9 trains (for the initial load of 44k people per day).

So averaged over 40 years, there are around 12+9 trains operating. That gives us 21 trains, making 4 trips a day. (Side note: 21*4: That's 84 trips per day, both ways, meaning that assuming 14 working-hours on a platform, there are 3 trains departing every hour in one direction - one every 20 minutes - convenient). Each trip has a capacity of 1200 people, 365 days a year, for 40 years. 

    21*4*1200*365*40 = 1471680000 passengers total.

1,471,680,000 passengers total: that's **1.47 Billion passengers**. And how much is being charged per seat per trip? ₹ 3000? 

###That gives us a total revenue collection of ₹ 4.415 Trillion. 

Let's assume that the train only runs at 70% seating capacity, on average. They would still collect ₹ 3.09 Trillion. 

[Operational costs will be around ₹ 412 cr (₹ 4.12 billion) per year](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Yearly-bullet-train-operations-to-cost-Rs-412cr-Report/articleshow/39191311.cms) which comes to a total of ₹ 164.8 billion over 40 years. 

That leaves us with ₹ 2.93 Trillion in revenue, with which we need to repay a total loan value of ₹ 1.43 Trillion. 

**That leaves a cool ₹ 1.496 trillion as pure profit, after paying back every penny of the loan.**

###Wait, what?! 

*You're telling me, we can basically drop the ticket prices to ₹ 1500 per seat (an act that will almost surely yield packed trains every day) and* **still** *pay off the loan?!* 

I dunno! Let's check: 

* 1.471 billion trips * ₹ 1500 = ₹ 2.2075 Trillion. 
* *STILL* assume just 75% occupancy: ₹ 1.656 Trillion.
* Deducting the operational costs leaves: ₹ 1.491 Trillion. 

Hot *damn*, we can pay for the train using just ticket collection, even if we price the tickets at ₹ 1500, and using the most conservative estimates possible. With ₹ 1.656 Trillion revenue, we easily could allow for an increase in ""operational costs"" to ₹ 5.675 billion per year (a whopping **38% increase** in operational costs, compared to the ₹ 4.12 billion figure) and still be able to pay everything off just fine... in just 40 years.

Who in their right minds thinks this is a bad idea? Hell, Ahmadabad-Mumbai Sleeper buses take 8 hours, and charge between ₹ 700-1400. The Shinkansen will be absolutely *flooded* if they drop prices.

Business/Finance,Indian banking system under attack!,171,589exo,blackberry_rad,84,"I have a strong reason to believe that Indian banking is under systematic attack. The shit hole goes very deep and the problem is compounded by the fact that the media ""tones"" down its coverage (obviously to avoid panic). There are malware attacks (on ICICI which is siphoning of email contacts and sending its account holders phishing emails), Advanced persistent threats on Axis Bank (they disclosed this to RBI), ATM frauds as in State Bank of India and multiple accounts of phishing attacks on individuals. Union Bank has also suffered cyber heist. 

A worrying trend is by use of SIM Swap. Fraudsters get your personal details (easily available through WhatsApp), your details through identity thefts and blocking your actual SIM's so that you cannot receive the SMS alerts. 

Two factor authentication is very basic (dependent on passwords alone) which again can be easily retrieved because most users re-use their passwords. 

Its getting scarier and worsened. 


A simple remedy as of now is to change PIN of your existing debit card and get ""CHIP and PIN"" card which secures transaction because they cannot be replicated easily. Of course, moving away from WhatsApp is a sensible decision (use BBM/ Threema) so that your identity details through phone numbers is not compromised. 

Edit 1: In response to ""proofs"" and so called ""click bait""; here are the links. Please connect the dots. 
Further, BBM and Threema allow you to be anonymous because outside the system, they can't do anything to your PINS. :-)

#But wait... the Bill says 'Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services'. How are they allowed to do these *other* things?
___

There has been a lot of debate for years about the Aadhaar card. On March 16, Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016 was passed as a money bill. During the debate, our finance minister said time and again that the Aadhaar cards will be used specifically for providing subsidies and other financial benefits. He *said* it, but if anyone had bothered to take a peek into the proposed bill, they would have understood what was going on. 

But alas, the bill was brought on a Friday, our representatives had to fly back home. It's [""Take out the Trash"" day](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4l3qup/how_pleb_mps_try_to_impose_their_will_and_fail/)! So, meh.

*For a detailed analysis of what the Aadhaar Bill contains and why it was passed a s money bill, [read this](http://www.policypeepul.com/blog/2016/5/11/the-aadhar-bill-is-it-a-risk-worth-taking)*

**Changing the bill *after* it becomes an Act**

Aye. That can be done. 

There is a whole **Clause 54** left lying around titled ""Power of Authority to make Regulations"" in the [passed Aadhaar Act, 2016](http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2016/168717.pdf). This particular clause lets the government change multiple aspects of the bill by issuing notifications. These notifications are then supposed to be laid formally in both houses of Parliament once the next session begins.

[Clause 54: Regulations rock peepal!](http://imgur.com/A5DXwmx)

[MOAR REGULATIONS!](http://imgur.com/q5hLCrm)


Look at these particular subsections. The government can change provisions for any of these *without the prior approval of Parliament*:

- [Biometric Information](http://imgur.com/i4lD5oS)

- [Other purposes](http://imgur.com/wqW7aPQ)

- [Other tech safeguards](http://imgur.com/xrJZpCO)

- [Maintaining, updating and deletion of Aadhaar numbers](http://imgur.com/3xhjdhm)

All of these subsections are so bloody vague that they can cover anything that a citizen does. What the heck does ""other purposes"" even mean?!

I have never seen anyone in Parliament challenging a notification. Many Acts are slyly changed in this manner. Please note (before you start outraging about how evil the present government is), this phenomenon is not something that was started by the Modi government, all governments in the past have been doing it in one way or the other. By keeping the wordings vague in the proposed bill itself, it gives a leeway for the executive to change it at a later date without consulting Parliament.

But... this has to stop somewhere, right? RIGHT?

#What can we do about it now?
___
Well, nothing, I’m afraid. I just wanted to put it out there. The only public intervention possible was *before* the Bill became an Act.  

Unless the [Supreme Court strikes down the Aadhaar Act’s validity](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4g34n7/an_important_supreme_court_hearing_is_coming_up/) or says it’s an invasion of the fundamental right to privacy, the public can’t do anything about it except watch & get Aadhaar cards in the process. 

If the SC *does* strike the Act down, I’m afraid it might be too late. The government is already on an overdrive to get maximum Aadhaar registrations. They are claiming that more than a billion people are now registered, even Aanganwaadis and Government hospitals are doing daily drives to get newborns registered.


I will end with a quote by a wise fictional one eyed man called Alastor “Mad Eye” Moody:

EDIT: Added a link to a detailed post on the Aadhaar Bill and its various provisions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4obpst/the_aadhaar_trojan/
Business/Finance,Our Banks are in trouble & we need to talk about it,426,47ogw5,kumbhakaran,93,"Amidst the prolonged JNU controversy &amp; Jat Quota stir, one big development is constantly being ignored for the past two weeks. Our Banks (PSBs) have declared they have [4.4 lakh crore](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/at-rs-4-lakh-crore-bad-loans-exceed-market-value-of-psu-banks/articleshow/51078318.cms) worth Non Performing Assets (NPAs) as of December 2015. 

Here, I will attempt to break it all down in layman terms. What, why, when and how it affects us, the taxpayer. I'm no finance expert, so please point out any errors I make. I had to go through a lot of complicated jargon (it's weird how these things are always so complicated) to make sense of it.

**What are NPAs and why should we care?**

Loans whose three consecutive installments are not paid are classified as Non Performing Assets (NPAs). After an NPA or bad loan is declared, the bank can initiate the process of recovery and restructuring of that loan. It will try to get new management to run projects, auction off collateral and try to recover the amount, which is rarely equivalent to the amount of loan given. Especially in case of big loans. 

The NPAs that have been declared recently are mostly by big corporate borrowers (according to some sources, around 65-70% of total defaulters are big corps). Take the example of Vijay Mallaya. Kingfisher Airlines borrowed an amount of Rs 7000 crore from 17 banks. These loans were declared as NPA and the recoverable amount has come to a mere Rs 6 crore. Go figure how much will be recovered from the 4.4 lakh crore. 

On top of it, [Vijay Mallya just resigned from United Spirits](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/budget/article-vijay-mallya-resigns-from-united-spirits-gets-rs-515-crore-1281435?pfrom=home-lateststories) and got a payout of ~~$515 million~~ Rs 515 crore. Good times for him while the 17 banks unitedly struggle to recover the loan amount. 

**So if the loans can't be recovered, what happens to the banks?** 

Simply put, they register losses, throw up their hands and tell the Government, ""Sorry [boss, can't get these loans back](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/state-run-banks-like-sbi-bank-of-baroda-central-bank-of-india-apprise-pm-narendra-modi-of-rising-bad-loans/articleshow/50990898.cms). We need to make profits. Pliss to help."" 

**What will the Government do about this?**

One word: Bailout. 
This whole thing is turning into a big cluster fuck. 'Sources' have been saying the government is planning to infuse Rs 70,000 crore till 2019 into PSBs to calm things down. They have already infused Rs 20,000 crore this year. This amount will not help banks deal with the problem in totality but it's a temporary measure to ensure they don't just collapse under the weight of NPAs. 

**Does that Government have enough money to save the banks?**

No. 

Here's a few things which the government has to spend on in the near future:

1) [Food Security Act](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-02-03/news/70313785_1_national-food-security-act-prime-minister-narendra-modi-food-subsidy) 

2) [MGNREGA](http://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2016/02/nda-pursuing-mgnrega-bengal-and-up-election/)

3) [Seventh pay commission](http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/of-the-servants-by-the-servants-for-the-servants/)

5) [Increased Defence allocation](http://www.businesstoday.in/union-budget-2016-17/expert-columns/defence-budget-allocation-likely-to-see-minimum-10-per-cent-hike/story/229336.html)

The revenue, on the other hand, doesn't seem that rosy. The government has [kept the fuel prices high](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/excise-duty-hiked-on-petrol-by-re-1litre-on-diesel-by-rs-1-5/) to get excise duty on it. The finance minister has been saying this is being done to reduce our fiscal deficit, which is fair. But then in that case where will the money for 'capital infusion in banks' come from? 

(I have to point out here that the first two expenditure items I mentioned are something that the present government has avoided spending on much till now. I don't blame them because the GST plan didn't really work out, so they have to go on an appeasement spree to calm their voters.)

**Well, that's all dandy well awesome but who's fault is it?**

This problem, unfortunately, cannot be pinned down on a single person or party. So I've made a list! 

1) *Raghuram Rajan / Reserve Bank of India*

The banks have been more or less forced to declare these loans because Raghuram Rajan sent notices telling them to clean up their balance sheets. He did this so that the banks can start a fresh cycle of loan disbursements to boost investment in the country. It's a good move in the long term but it all depends on whether the banks are in a position to handle the burden at this point of time.

A Supreme Court bench recently [pulled up the RBI to ask WTF is happening](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bad-debts-rbi-supreme-court-bank-defaulters/). 

&gt; The bench headed by Chief Justice asked, ""People are owing thousands of crore to the public banks… it is a big fraud. Top ten public sector banks have written off Rs 40,000 crore alone in 2015. It is all there in this Indian Express report. Public financial institutions are lending money despite knowing no returns. RBI is supposed to keep a watch on these banks. What are you doing about it?”

They asked RBI to submit a list of defaulters with loans over Rs 500 crore. To which the RBI replied:

&gt; “The required information is not available with us. Banks are required to report the bad loans on a consolidated basis.""

Personally, I find this response really strange because a periodic reporting of big loans is done to both the Finance Ministry and RBI. How can they ask the banks to ~~waive off~~ write-off loans worth lakhs of crores without having an estimate of who the big defaulters are? 

*2) Manmohan Singh / Previous UPA Government*

If anyone is to blame, it's them. These loans which are being declared NPAs have been given during their time. They could have taken measure to make sure the banks are being prudent when handing out money, but they didn't. So they have left this huge crumbling mass of debt which is all coming out. Like pus from a wound. Ugh.

*3) Narendra Modi / Present NDA Government*

If this capital infusion a.k.a. bailout continues and the economy gets in trouble, the NDA government will be definitely blamed for it. The whole point is that they are now in power and they have to clean up the mess even if they want to blame the previous government for it. The people will not forgive the BJP for a major (possibly catastrophic) economic downturn, no matter who is responsible for it. 

Modi has projected himself, right from the beginning, as the savior of the economy. Now that the economy is facing a challenge, he can't afford to point fingers at UPA. But he will, he most definitely will. Rightfully so, but that won't help matters at all.

*4) Faceless, nameless / The Banks*

Aah yes. These frikkin Bankers. The biggest culprits are the bank managers who are responsible for due diligence before disbursing loans. If there is an NPA in a particular bank branch, the manager is held responsible for it. In case of big loans, the top management has to give approvals and they are also held responsible. 

Through some clever book keeping and financial witchcraft, the managers have been sitting on this pile of rotting loans. They didn't have any reason to tell the higher ups about the terrible situation they were in. Until Rajan sent them that notice and forced them to declare these bad loans. 

*5) Big Corporates*

The usual suspects. They will benefit immensely from this loan write-off and bailouts. Just like Vijay Mallya did. They have, in the past decade or so, taken a lot of loans which are now proving to be bad assets for the banks. Even the Economic survey has pointed out that these [corporate debts are worrisome](http://www.businesstoday.in/opinion/perspective/economic-survey-corporate-debts-consumer-spend-monsoons/story/229607.html). They have called it 'The Twin Balance Sheet Problem'... which makes no sense to me...

Some projects haven't taken off due to land acquisition issues, Infrastructure problems and environmental clearances. There is limited investment coming in from abroad. Therefore, the government was eager to push GST and all of these investment driving schemes for the past two years. Didn't really work out as they planned. Even if they manage to pave the way for these pending projects, the corporations are known to delay and milk them for maximum profits. (Eg: KG Basin, IGI Airport and many more.) 

**So what happens next? Also, TLDR.**

To put it simply: The taxpayer gets f'ed in the a. As always.

EDIT: Forgot to add one more thing.

Business/Finance,Last Week in the Indian Parliament #2 (May 02 to May 06),368,4it1ef,kumbhakaran,68,"Hello /r/India!

I bring you the second edition of Last Week in the Indian Parliament! I got a lot of feedback last time and people insisted I keep it more narrative based. I shall do so but I have also included briefs from PRS in the end for the legislative business transacted during the week. 

Boy do I have stories for you today!

Last week, a Rajya Sabha member was suspended for a day for making ‘unauthorised inane noise’; a controversial amendment was passed which allows foreign funding for political parties; the government of the day tactfully avoided being embarrassed by a new ‘Jumla’; and Big Tobacco fought the Government with Zero Hour Notices.

Let’s get right into it!

___
#Money Bill strikes again!
___
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is a troubled lot. They have an easy majority in Lok Sabha, which allows them to push their bills through, but they don’t have the numbers in Rajya Sabha to do the same. For the past two years, the opposition in the upper house has blocked their legislative agenda through the creative use of their throats and by camping all around the speaker’s grand throne-chair, protesting away to glory. But the Government of the day seems to have a few tricks up its sleeve. They seem to be aiming to completely ignore the upper house by using the [Money Bill route](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/492acw/lets_talk_about_the_new_aadhaar_bill_it_can/). Twice!


The first instance of ‘Operation Money Bill’ was observed on March 11, when the Lok Sabha passed the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016. During the consideration of this bill, many members screamed bloody murder and opposed this legislation being certified as a Money Bill. It went to the Rajya Sabha for recommendations. The bill got passed, 4 days later, on March 16 in its original form. The government of the day seems to have hit Parliament procedure gold. So merely two months later, they decided to do it again.

And this time, it was to bring in FDI in politics!

The Finance Bill 2016 was passed in the Lok Sabha with a clause that did not belong in that legislation, namely, amendments the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 (FCRA).

___
#BJP & Congress: Secretive Team Players
___

The FCRA Amendment is a strange one. Earlier foreign companies were not allowed to make donations to political parties. For obvious reasons. Otherwise entities like Monsanto [would have a field day](http://imgur.com/AsZqfLk). 

The logic being that foreign entities should not be able to influence our Parliament to make laws that favor them. In 2014, both BJP and Congress were found guilty by the Delhi High Court of accepting foreign contributions from UK based company Vedanta. So the government of the day decided to deal with it by making a retrospective amendment to the FCRA act by hiding it within the Finance Bill.

This amendment has cleared Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha has no say in it (because, you know, ‘Operation Money Bill’) and the President’s approval will come soon. Say hello to FDI in Politics.

___
#The Curious Case of Finance Bill, 2016
___
During the debate on the Finance Bill on Wednesday, Asaduddin Owaisi raised a point of order to question the government on the validity of the FCRA amendment. He argued that this act comes under the Home Ministry and amending it through a Finance Bill goes against the provisions of the Constitution. He demanded that the discussion should be suspended immediately since the bill is flawed. 

The decision landed on the lap of deputy speaker of Lok Sabha Arjun Charan Singh, who looked like a dog-lover with a cat in his lap. Unsure what to do. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was away on an official visit to Germany so MoS Jayant Sinha tried to do a [ninja save](http://imgur.com/G9lMcPM). He told Owaisi that Jaitley will respond to his query while replying to the debate.

**[24 hours later](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/spongebob/images/e/e8/24_Hours_Later..._.png/revision/latest?cb=20130519222728)**

While giving his reply speech, the Fin Min sort of ignored the FCRA issue. Instead, he spoke about giving funds to the Polavaram Dam. It upset Biju Janata Dal from Orissa enough to stage a rather noisy walkout. The debate ended abruptly and clause by clause on the Finance Bill began. 

Still no word about the point of order despite Owaisi asking the speaker for a ruling.

[Cricket sounds #1](http://imgur.com/DKiZ6Mw)

The Finance Minister had made 49 official amendments to the Finance Bill, so the speaker was going through them one by one. Clause 233, which concerns the controversial FCRA amendment, was clubbed in with Clauses 220 to 230, schedules first to fifteen and passed together.

[Cricket sounds #2](http://imgur.com/wn6P3Mv)

After the clause by clause consideration was completed, the speaker gave a ruling to Owaisi’s point of order and denied it. Ignoring protests from some members, she called for the passage of the bill.

[Cricket sounds #3](http://imgur.com/JxBvCE6)

Not a single word about the FCRA amendment was spoken that day. Just like that, a super important law that will change how our political parties are funded, was accepted by the Lok Sabha. 

The Finance Minister be like [#EpicWin](http://img.memecdn.com/epic-win_o_834502.gif).

___
#The ‘Jumla’ that escaped
___
Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad raised the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) issue in Rajya Sabha. Jairam Ramesh has written about this extensively in The Hindu ( [Part 1](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/jairam-ramesh-on-the-krishna-godavari-basin-scam/article8486493.ece) & [Part 2](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/comment-article-by-jairam-ramesh-on-the-kg-basin-scam-part-ii/article8533360.ece) ). 
To give you a short rundown of this ‘Jumla’, in 2005 GSPC claimed that the KG Basin had an epic deposit of natural gas worth an estimated Rs. 2,20,000 crore. They spent Rs 19,700 crore over a period of a decade for ‘gas exploration’ but did not get even a tiny whiff of the sweet sweet hydrocarbon gas mixture. Five CAG reports over the past five years have pointed out discrepancies in the way GSPC operated. The Congress has been dying to dig deep into this issue and they finally did it in Rajya Sabha. They took out their shovels, ready to break the earth while singing merry songs of victory.

But then, they struck a rock called Arun Jaitley even before they started digging.

Jaitley told Azad that this issue cannot be raised in Parliament because the [Public Accounts Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Accounts_Committee_(India) (PAC) is already examining it. The PAC is a committee of selected members of Parliament, constituted by the Parliament of India, for the auditing of the revenue and the expenditure of the Government of India. The house cannot deliberate on matters that a Parliamentary committee is already deliberating. 

___
#Rule 255: Kick the disrupter
___
Rajya Sabha was yet again disrupted at the beginning of the week over the Agusta Westland issue. Members trooped into the well, shouting garbled slogans against the Government. Then, Rule 255 happened. 

> “The Chairman may direct any member whose conduct is in his opinion grossly disorderly to withdraw immediately from the Council and any member so ordered to withdraw shall do so forthwith and shall absent himself during the remainder of the day's meeting.” [Source](http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/rs_rule/generalrulesproc.asp)

Hamid Ansari, Chairman of Rajya Sabha invoked this rule and ordered Sukhendu Roy of the TMC to be removed from the upper house for a day. Roy was seen standing at his seat and demanding (very loudly) to know who benefitted from the Agusta Westland scam. 

Here’s an excerpt from the debate:

[""Please stop making inane noise""](http://imgur.com/JQhbrjq)

[""Please stop talking... or else""](http://imgur.com/vl0UVaB)

[""RULE 255 BITCHES!!! GTFO!""](http://imgur.com/v3kMrpA)

After the Sukhendu Roy left, taking his ‘unauthorized inane noise’ with him, the Congress continued its valiant attempt to stall the proceedings in the house. Nitin Gadkari, visibly upset, requested Ansari to smite them with his awesome legal powers and invoke 255 on all of them.

#Big Tobacco vs Unhealthy Lung pictures
___
There have been three zero hour notices raised in the Lok Sabha this session regarding increasing health warnings on tobacco products to 85%. To give you some context, the government had passed an order in 2014 which mandated tobacco manufacturers to show gruesome pictures of decaying lungs that cover up to 85% of the product packet. 

The pictures would dissuade new smokers from taking up the deadly cause and it has been proven to be quite effective in many countries around the world. This order was to come into force on April 1 this year and there has been a battle raging between the Tobacco industry and the government on the sidelines. /u/dextermilburn has been talking about ITC shutting down and opening factories [in his posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4inj30/last_week_in_indian_economy_for_the_week_ending/) for a few weeks now. The Parliament also became a stage where this battle is being fought by filing notices in favor and against the government’s move.

Last week on May 3rd, Baijayant Panda raised a zero hour notice supporting the government’s move to increase the warning size. He urged the government to hold its ground on increasing health warnings and to implement its order diligently. 

On 27th April, two other members had raised a notice to oppose the government’s move, namely R Dhruvanarayana and Sharadkumar Bansode. Both of these members spoke about how tobacco farmers and beedi manufacturers will be adversely affected if these warnings are imposed. They wanted the government to consider the plight of the farmers connected to the industry and not impose the order.

Last Wednesday, the Supreme Court had a hearing where upheld the Government’s 2014 order and asked Tobacco companies to implement it.

**What is a Zero Hour and why is it important?**

‘Zero Hour’ refers to a time period in the Parliament when members can raise matters of urgent public importance to bring it to the notice of the government of the day. Every day when the Parliament is in session, there is one hour allotted to raise such notices. A member is required to file the notice in Parliament before 9 a.m. on the same day. A ballot takes place in which notices are randomly selected and are allowed to be raised. In Lok Sabha, the Zero hour usually happens from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. and in Rajya Sabha, it happens from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. It’s upto the speakers in both houses to decide the time slot of the zero hour, depending on how heavy the legislative business is.

The Zero hour is easily one of the most ignored aspect of our Parliamentary process. It a perfect way to judge what is on the minds of our elected representatives. For instance, in the past two weeks numerous notices were raised on the water crisis and drought situation in the country. Considering that these notices are randomly selected through a ballot, the sheer volume points towards the fact that this crisis is bigger and badder than we imagine.

**The Good News: Inflation**

Do you hear that sound? That’s the sound of retail stores in India reducing their prices to a 3 month low. After rising for five straight months, retail inflation in February came down to 5.18%. This has been [attributed](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-03-14/news/71509641_1_retail-inflation-price-rise-pulses) largely to a fall in the prices of vegetables, pulses and fruits. While cereal prices remained the same, the dark lining is that prices of eggs shot up significantly. Time to substitute omelets with salads, perhaps? But that’s just the retail end of business. Coming to the wholesale side of business, inflation in wholesale prices fell for the 16th straight month and remained [negative](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Decline-in-inflation-on-expected-line-Finanace-ministry/articleshow/51400780.cms) at -0.91%. The data comes from the Consumer and Wholesale Price Indices, which track retail and wholesale prices around the country.


**The Bad News: Foreign Trade**

Not to harsh your mellow, but stop rejoicing over the good news for a second and hear this. India’s February Exports decreased by 5.66%. If you haven’t been following the export numbers, and no one can blame you for that, this is the 15th consecutive month in which exports have [decreased](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/rfZrfTFsUFMVWkTXV8wEAK/Indias-February-trade-deficit-narrows-to-65-billion.html). Petroleum products was the dark swan as exports of gasoline, jet fuel etc. fell by 28%. The golden goose of the bunch was jewellery as exports of shiny rings and necklaces increased by 11%. Just to give you some perspective, our brothers to the north, the Chinese saw their exports fall by 25%. On the flip side, India’s imports also decreased by 5.03%. You win some, you lose some, right? 


**Rajya Sabha Feels Betrayed**

Giving statutory backing to the unique identity number system, the Lok Sabha this week has passed the [Aadhaar Bill](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lok-sabha-passes-aadhaar-bill/article8361467.ece?homepage=true). This newly passed bill is a significant instrument for the government’s Direct Transfer Benefits scheme for better targeting of subsidies. The argument against it was that it violated the Supreme Court order that said an Aadhaar Card cannot be mandatory but only voluntary. Now, if you remember your 7th standard civics syllabus, both houses of the parliament, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, have to pass a bill for it to become a law. What your 7th standard civics textbook probably didn’t mention is the Rajya Sabha has no say in the matter if a specific bill is categorized as a “money bill”. Which is exactly what Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who piloted the Aadhaar bill through parliament, did so that it can bypass the Rajya Sabha where Jaitley’s BJP does not have a majority. One can only imagine how emotionally hurt the Rajya Sabha was when the Lok Sabha went behind its back to pass the Aadhaar Bill. 

**It’s Raining Black Gold: Sweet, Sweet Oil**

“Tass-Yurikah” sounds like an Urdu swear word, but it’s actually the name of a Russian oil field. Soon enough, it won’t even be entirely Russian anymore. A group of Indian oil companies signed a deal with Rosneft, the Russian oil company that owns [Tass-Yurikah](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/ongc-videsh-ltd-ioc-consortium-to-buy-russian-oil-fields-for-4-2-billion/articleshow/51427860.cms), to buy a 29.9% stake in the oilfield for $1.28 billion (₹8,505 crore). This puts the Indians in partnership with the British oil major BP who owns 20% while the remaining 50.1% is still owned by Rosneft. Deals to explore a possible stake sale in Vankor, another Russian oilfield, were also signed. This comes at a time when global oil prices are falling off a cliff, just like BJP’s poll numbers in that [recent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar_Legislative_Assembly_election,_2015) Bihar election. This also comes at a time when Russia’s economy is suffering from an acute case of international sanctions that were imposed on Russia after they snatched Crimea from Ukraine, just like the JD(U) snatched seats from BJP in that recent Bihar election. Too political? Thought so. Meanwhile, they just [hiked](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/economy/article-petrol-price-hiked-by-rs-3-07-litre-diesel-by-rs-1-90-litre-1287407) petrol and diesel prices by 3.07/litre and 1.07/litre.

**Ban on 344 Illegal Drugs**

The government is playing the game that everyone knows it excels at - banning things. This time around, the health ministry has issued a ban on over [344 drugs](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/health-ministry-bans-344-fixed-dose-combination-drugs-1286977). No, not the one’s that make you hallucinate or see sounds and hear colours, but the one’s that are pharmaceutical. Known as “combination drugs”, these drugs combine two or more drugs together so the patient only has to pop one pill instead of three. Technically, they were being sold illegally since none of them had approval from the central government, but had entered markets nevertheless after receiving blessings from only the state governments. At least this time around, the bans make more sense. Cough syrup Corex and the famous Vicks Action 500 were among the 344 substances banned. However, the Delhi High Court reversed the ban on [Corex](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/corporates/article-corex-popular-cough-syrup-not-banned-for-now-says-court-1287076?ndtv_related) and is set to hear the case on March 21st after Pfizer ([PFIZER](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3APFIZER&ei=uk_vVqjdIoSVjAGihJ_IBw)), the company that makes Corex, sent lawyers marching down to the Court right away. Feeling a bit jealous of Pfizer, 21 other pharmaceutical companies, including P&G India ([PGHH](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3APGHH&ei=tk_vVsGTOJPwjAGTuZQg)), the maker of [Vicks](http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/hc-relief-for-14-more-drug-firms/210246.html), also managed to convince the court to reverse bans placed on their drugs as well.

**Make Room for One More Tax**

You know how countries sometimes impose tariffs on foreign goods to make domestic players competitive? Well, states across India such as Uttarakhand, Bihar and Assam seem to have forgotten that they are not independent countries but merely states within one. It’s okay, we all go through an identity crisis at some point. Lawmakers in those states have imposed an “[entry tax](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-03-15/news/71543125_1_entry-tax-goods-services-tax-levy)” on e-commerce websites for selling products that were not made in those states - which sounds eerily similar to tariffs imposed by sovereign nations. What could make this worse? Almost half a dozen other states are also considering imposing a similar tax on e-commerce goods sold inside the state that were manufactured outside the state. If this goes through, you might have to foot the bill for your state’s poor manufacturing as online retailers pass these taxes on to the customer. Also, the grapevine has it that Amazon offered to acquire Flipkart for [$8 billion](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Flipkart-and-Amazon-may-have-explored-sale-talks-say-sources/articleshow/51421374.cms) (₹53,160 crore) last year, but the deal fell through. Make of that what you will.

Business/Finance,Stay in an excellent job vs come back to live with my family?,32,65nu2c,aznten,47,"I am in a very big dilemma right now. I have to choose between staying in my current job in Netherlands and become a wealthy man or going back to my own country and stay with my family(and not be so wealthy).

Background:

A bit of a background, I come from a south asian (pakistan,india,bangladesh) country where I lived with my family. I live with my mom, brother and little sister. I am 28 years old and not married. I am responsible for the finances of my house. So i pay for everything, including the college fee of my brother and sister and daily expenses such as food, electricity, rent etc. The college fee is done now as they are both in their last semester. Although, I will still be responsible for our daily expenses.

I recently went to the Netherlands and studied there for two years. I got a degree and even found a really nice job.

I have two options to choose from:

**Option 1: Stay at my current Job in Netherlands**

I have a really nice job in the Netherlands. There is such a big difference in the working conditions that I don't think I can work as a software engineer when I come back home.

My one month's salary in Netherlands is equal to my 3-4 months salary in my own country. In fact the difference in salary is so big that I dont think I can work as a software engineer when I go back home. It will just feel wrong to me to do the same type of work for 1/4th of the money.

Almost all companies treat you like a human in the Netherlands. They have really nice laws about employment law. I don't have to work overtime and even if I do work overtime, I will be paid for the overtime. This is not the case in my own country. In my country they expect you to work overtime and think you are not motivated if you refuse. And they will never pay you for overtime.

In the Netherlands you can be on sick leave for a maximum of two years and still get paid salary. Though it is not so common to be sick for so long but it is really comforting to know. In my country they start deducting your holidays when you are sick. And when all of your holidays are gone then they start deducting your salary. And if you dont show up after two months then there is a big chance you will be let go.

Besides my job, I have other benefits in the Netherlands. I have been on so many dates in the Netherlands which was not so easy in my country. Online dating is still non-existent in my country. I currently have a girlfriend in the Netherlands. I feel really free and independent in terms of dating. I can go to anyone's house and invite any girl in my own house I also have nice public transport, online shopping for almost all video games, books, clothes etc. I have a really nice gym. The only career i can think of having when I go back is do my own business.

While living in Netherlands has good points, there are also some bad things. There are some things that make me hate Netherlands sometimes. If I stay there for one year without a holiday then I get really miserable. I really miss my family on my holidays. I also feel that they sometimes look at us in a condescending way.I have had a lot of incidents related to racism. It seems like they feel like they are much better than us. I have been asked all sorts of questions like : Is there a tv in your country? Do you have internet in your country? Do you know what a washing machine is ? Sometimes people give me a look of disgust even. And they get more weird if they know I am a muslim. 
 
**Option 2: Go back to my home country and live with my family**

I mentioned a lot of really nice things in the first option but I really miss my family and my country's food. My mom is always very sad when my holidays are up and I have to go back. She is always crying when I leave. She said that I can stay in the Netherlands for as long as I want but she is happy when I am around. My little sister also misses me. She told me that I should come back next year. She is going to be married in a few years then I wont be able to see her so often. When I am in the Netherlands I have to do everything by myself. But when I am in my own country then my mom takes care of the cooking. We have a maid for cleaning. My brother takes care of all of the groceries. I can go out and buy my country's snacks, street food everyday. I can eat my own food everyday.

Regarding finances, i will have around 20k$ of savings by next year. What is your opinion?",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/65nu2c/stay_in_an_excellent_job_vs_come_back_to_live/

**27 Banks today = 6 Banks Tomorrow**

Strength in unity is the chant on Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s mind as a new expert committee was set up to explore possible [bank mergers](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-govt-may-form-6-stong-banks-from-merger-of-27-psbs-to-tackle-rising-bad-loan-issue-2186336) to bring down the number of state-run banks in India from 27 today to just 6 in the future. And with the bad loans crisis looming over the banking industry, strength is just what the doctor prescribed. Apparently, since public sector banks are already short-staffed, bank employees don’t have to worry about downsizing in case any of these mergers actually happen. Words of caution, however: Too big to fail?

**IIP: Third Time’s (not) the Charm**

For the third month in a row, [industrial production](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/G1Hs0uma1LuBdMLkYpQlFL/Indias-IIP-contracts-15-in-January-third-month-in-a-row.html) in India went down. The numbers for the month of January released just recently by the Central Statistical Organization don’t look good - a 1.5% drop in industrial production, that’s against a 1.2% drop in December and a 3.2% drop in November. That is bad with a capital B. Silver lining on the cloud that’s raining on everyone’s parade? Mining and Electricity sectors grew by 1.2% and 6.6% in January respectively. Raghuram Rajan, the main god that economists around the country worship who also moonlights as the Governor of RBI, has called the numbers “disappointing” while stating that though the economy is in recovery, the process is volatile.

**Housing For All by 2022**

So you thought Swachh Bharat was Prime Minister Modi’s only pet project? Then you haven’t heard about the Housing For All initiative under which the PM aims to provide homes for all Indian families by 2022. The country inched a step closer to that goal when the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the parliament, passed a landmark bill seeking to regulate the [Real Estate](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-realestate-regulations-parliament-idINKCN0WC1DJ) sector to bring more transparency and protect consumer interests. And this bill.. get this, was passed by bipartisan support as even the Congress came out of the woodwork to extend its support. Now when was the last time you heard about the ruling and the opposition party coming together and working to pass important legislation? Almost makes you wonder if they are.. [up to something](https://j.gifs.com/v29nEn.gif).

**Not Happening: EPF Tax**

The government has suddenly become very sensitive to any kind of backlash as was apparent when Arun Jaitley announced that a key budget proposal to tax withdrawals from EPF exceeding 40% of total investment would be rolled back. The proposal led to controversy among the small but vocal professional class who viewed it as a tax on the hard-working middle-class employees, and thus was promptly [shot down](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-pensions-epf-tax-withdraw-jaitley-idINKCN0WB0BE). Might it have anything to do with the not one, not two, not three, but five states holding elections in April and May? With politics, you can be sure that the elections have a big role in.. really everything that politicians do or don’t do. 

**Vijay Mallya Just Can’t Win**

It’s hard to empathize with the problems of rich billionaires, but poor Mallya just can’t seem to catch a break. A debt recovery tribunal in Bengaluru has [cash blocked](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/vijay-mallya-barred-from-accessing-rs-515-crore-severance-pay-1284719) Vijay Mallya by halting the $75 million (₹515 crore) payment he was set to receive as settlement from Diageo plc., the largest shareholder in Mallya’s United Spirits Ltd. ([MCDOWELL-N](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AMCDOWELL-N&ei=yRjmVsGsBsWd2Aas8ovwBg)). Later, a bunch of banks ganged up on him as they seized [trademarks](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-mallya-idUSKCN0WC184) related to the now defunct Kingfisher Airlines, trademarks such as “Kingfisher”, “Flying Models” and “King of Good Times”. And then came the accusations that Mallya has fled the country, which led to the banks asking a court to return and impound his passport. Moral of the story: Kids, never borrow $1.4 billion to run a flashy airliner when you can’t repay it. Especially when you already own a successful liquor company.

**Ambani vs. Netflix**

Mukesh Ambani has decided that there is no way Netflix can just waltz into India and lay claim to his homeground without facing any competition. Not one to keep his hands off any pie, he is reportedly entering the country’s cable TV sector through his latest venture called RJio. Ambani’s Reliance Industries ([RELIANCE](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ARELIANCE&ei=DBnmVsG4Atf3jAHklKf4DA)) which already owns TV channels like CNBC, Colors, ETV and many more is planning to spend about $2 billion (₹13,403 crore) over the next three years to capture 20 million TV subscribers. One of the offerings in store from RJio is [Jio Play](http://www.reuters.com/article/india-reliance-cable-tv-idUSKCN0W92J4), a movie and TV series streaming service, in short, it’s version of Netflix. India being a massive entertainment market, Netflix probably isn’t going to watch this from the sidelines. Grab the popcorn, this movie just might get interesting.

Business/Finance,What does r/India think of Bitcoin? India must act now or miss out on this emerging technology.,40,6f3v9z,WishYouWereHear,29,"Bitcoin currently has grown so much in size that its market cap is bigger than any of USA's top airlines. Yes, these are Airlines like Delta with hundred's and hundreds of Boeing airplanes in their fleet connecting every city of America yet a simple technology run on a computer has usurped all these airlines. No mean feat. 

Australia and Japan have completely legalized BTC and it is being used as tender for everything from grocery to cars, South Korea as well, even Malaysia's btc market is booming. 

Meanwhile Indian Gov is actively trying to play down BTC, some ministers are still calling it scam, play of the devil, likening it with ""chit funds"" etc. What the fuck is wrong with the finance brains and the IT brains of our country that we (as a country) are missing out on the biggest IT development since world wide web thanks to illiterates talking their talk. 

And Im not talking about middle men like ""Zebpay"" and ""Unocoin"" - Bitcoin was invented to cut these middlemen out of the chain, yet these are the ones who are profiting selling BTC to Indians at a 25% markup price and taking a hefty commission. 

We are also giving a big play to more middle men companies like PayTM who are trying to reinvent the currency wheel and are doing such a bad job at it, yet most Indians will tell you that PAYTM is the best and Bitcoin is a scam. Currency wallets (payment banks) are outdated by atleast 5 years, they were big in 2010 in the USA and today nobody uses them - yet PAYTM is such a big rage here - outdated technology, very poor profitablity, the PAYTM business exists only to support its CEO and turn him into a Billionaire while the rest of the PAYTM user base suffers from lack of basic communication access with Paytm.


Make no mistake, India will follow the rest of the world eventually, as we always do, and end up accepting BTC in 2020, but by that time the world would have already moved on and derived the most out of bitcoin. Many businesses are already hedging their funds vs BTC or investing part of their profits into BTC and the growth of 2500% since 2015 will only make more companies turn to BTC. 

Im sure many smart Indians have already started to see the potential of BTC, lets use this thread to discuss the market in India. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6f3v9z/what_does_rindia_think_of_bitcoin_india_must_act/

Busy researching and taking all of your responses into account. A million thanks! <3

Hey, lovely people of Reddit!

Travelling India has been one of my lifelong dreams, and I finally find myself in a place where I'm able to begin saving up to make that dream a reality! I now come before you beautiful folk to seek advice in forming an itinerary.

Some details:

-I'm looking to stay anywhere from 3 months to a year, depending on finances. 

-I hope to find ways to meaningfully immerse in each place I visit (through volunteer positions, homestays, etc) and am definitely not looking to rush from one city to the next.

-I am especially interested in rural, natural areas which provide possibilities for trekking and other outdoor adventures. I am not at all interested in touristy, expat party bubbles.

-I'm excited by food (who isn't?), literature, history, music, yoga and Ayurvedic health practices.

I know these are fairly vague constraints but I'm overwhelmed by the vastness of the country and its multiplicities and would very much appreciate any pointers as to where to begin my travel research!

I plan on doing most of my exploring as a solo female traveler, so would also appreciate any advice to that end. 

A million thanks in advance!!

**RBI Drops Rates Like They’re Hot**

After four interest rate decreases in the past one year, the Reserve Bank of India cut interest rates by 0.25% again to a more than [5-year](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-repo-rates-decision-idINKCN0X20C1) low of 6.5%. This is the rate at which banks can borrow money from the RBI. What does it mean for you? One, loans of all kind might get cheaper. Two, investors in debt funds and tax-free bonds might make more money. Three, fixed deposit rates might get lower. Four, you’ll definitely see some self-proclaimed analysts on the TV bickering about this. The central bank also, unexpectedly, increased the reverse REPO rate by 0.25% to 6%. That’s the rate at which banks lend money to the RBI. The central bank’s main mission now is to ensure banks lower rates as well - now that banks can borrow for cheap, to ensure that they also lend for cheap - to boost the economy.


**Bihar Pulls A Gujarat - Bans Alcohol**

Heartbroken Romantics all across Bihar now have one more reason to cry - that bottle of whiskey in their hands right now might as well be the last bottle of whiskey in their hands ever. The state has decided to go the route of Gujarat, Nagaland and Manipur to completely ban all sales of [alcohol](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/05/indian-state-bihar-imposes-total-ban-on-alcohol-sales) (you didn’t know it was banned in Nagaland and Manipur as well, did you?). The move is expected to cost the state about ₹4,000 crore in loss of revenue from taxes on alcohol, and much more from businesses like bars and alcohol retailers shutting down and firing their employees. It’s payday for alcohol retailers in Jharkhand, the neighbouring state, as a move like this will increase sales of alcohol meant to be smuggled across state lines into Bihar to be illegally sold for higher prices. Shares of United Spirits ([MCDOWELL-N](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AMCDOWELL-N&ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), the country’s largest alcohol producer, were down 5% on the news - although that might just be because it’s a Vijay Mallya company.

**One Bank’s Trash Is Another ARC’s Treasure**

Indian banks have accumulated a staggering amount of bad loans - 11% of all loans are now at a risk of defaulting. And banks can’t run away from these bad loans fast enough. In come the ARCs - Asset Reconstruction Companies - that buy all the bad loans from the banks at dirt cheap prices. Banks are happy because at least they made some money from the loans. ARCs are happy because they just bought loans for pennies on the dollar (or paisas on the rupee) - and now they only need a few of those loans to not default to make huge profits. At least that’s the fantasy. Multiple global ARCs are [setting](http://www.businessinsider.in/Distressed-debt-buyers-are-sensing-an-opportunity-in-India-as-bad-loans-pile-up/articleshow/51694980.cms) up shop in India in hopes of being able to buy these bad loans from Indian banks. Are they the kryptonite to India’s bad loans crisis? Are they the white knights that will save India’s banks-in-distress? Only time will tell.

**Are Diamonds Forever?**

That’s the question the government is asking itself as it prepares to end its legal monopoly over diamond mining in India. After the first ever auction of a gold mine in February, which was won by Vedanta Ltd. ([VEDL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AVEDL&ei=gPUKV7ndPNeSmAGTo4-4Dw)), India is gearing up to do the same again and auction its first [ever](http://www.vccircle.com/news/infrastructure/2016/04/05/after-gold-india-set-its-first-diamond-mine-auction) diamond mine. The mine to be auctioned, located in Madhya Pradesh, is India’s only operational diamond mine and is valued at an estimated ₹106 crore. Global mining company Rio Tinto is one of the interested bidders. These auctions of new mines and minerals are being seen as a new form of privatization and disinvestment by the government. The auction of coal mines gave us the infamous Coalgate scam. Let’s hope the word ‘diamondgate’ continues to just mean a diamond-studded gate.

**Hot, New Scandal: The Panama Papers**

In Indian middle-class folklore, a Swiss bank account either means that you’ve finally made it big or that you’re a politician/builder. But a Swiss bank account is no longer the most lucrative way to hide your money. Rather, an offshore company in Panama is now the new Swiss bank account. Leaked data sizing up to 2.6 TB (Yes, terabytes, you read that right the first time) from a law firm in Panama that helped set up these offshore companies has [revealed](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/panama-papers-list-amitabh-bachchan-kp-singh-aishwarya-rai-iqbal-mirchi-adani-brother/) a list of rich and famous individuals around the world that own offshore companies in Panama, including more than 500 Indians like members of the Bachchan clan - Amitabh and Aishwarya. The global list includes the presidents of Ukraine and Argentina, Prime Ministers of Iceland and Pakistan, the King of Saudi Arabia and close friends of Vladimir Putin. Iceland’s PM has already been forced to resign due to the scandal. To be fair, tax evasion is not the only purpose of offshore companies - there are a lot of legitimate reasons for one to have an offshore company in Panama as well. For Amitabh Bachchan though, this just negates all the good PR that the *do boond zindagi ke* polio campaign brought him. As for you, see if you can even point to where Panama is on a globe.

Business/Finance,"[NP] Businesspeople of r/india, need your advise.",10,3okalt,throwaway41025,10,"Hi good people of r/india. I'm 31 and in a pretty heavy mess. I started a logistics b2b business in late 2012 after being in a first generation family run business (logistics too) since 2007. The industry has cut-throat competition and is also very unorganised and unregulated (anyone with a PAN card and an address can start) ; which is also probably the reason I could start mine (I barely had any other licenses, market knowledge or professional business management experience). I had some working capital to begin with (~Rs. 20L) and I burnt through the cash within a few months while trying to fiercely enter the market by selling below or at cost. Other than underquoting, selling at cost or absorbing the operational losses to safeguard the customer, I really didn't use the money at hand for any meaningful long term capital expenditure like systems, inventories, warehouses, staff etc. So once I ran out of cash (and this happened in mid-2013) I had absolutely no leverage to retain the hard-earned (and costly) customers and I started losing them. So though there was some decent turnover through all that cash burn, the bottom lines were all naturally red.

All this put me under tremendous stress. Under stress instead of approaching the banks for fresh funds, I approached private lenders for instant small funds to clear off the immediate debts to the vendors. These borrowings were obviously super costly but I ignored them so as not to antagonise the vendors. But the private lenders had a very small kitty compared to my requirements and suddenly I was left having to pay off the lenders as well as the vendors! 

In between all this, although I had asked my family to give me some time to settle down and tried making them understand the mess I was in, they barely understood anything and pressurised me into getting married. It was an arranged marriage. I do not want to blame my family anymore than this about the marriage because I am blessed with a very supportive and understanding wife. So I married in mid 2014. That happened and within 8-9 months, we decided (yet again against my full approval) to buy a freaking house. On one hand my business was bleeding cash so much that there was no blood left to even bleed and on the other I was shopping for houses - because my family (this time my wife and in-laws included!) absolutely wanted us to own a house of our own. Won't blame my wife because it was barely an year into the marriage and I hadn't told her the full extent of the issues as I didn't want to scare or stress her, so she and my in-laws were obviously not fully aware of the facts. 

Now, most of my family (excluding the wife and in-laws, once they realised they may have pressurised into buying the house they do not want to put any more undue pressure) are telling me to find a job to relieve part of the stress and I am willing too to look for a job. But I'm neck deep in liabilities and I just don't know how I can simply shut shop one day and just go looking for a job without fulfilling all my current liabilities.

All this might sound like a template for the perfect financial & business mismanagement, but here I am stressed as stressed can be and I really could use some advise. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3okalt/np_businesspeople_of_rindia_need_your_advise/

I am considering an option and would like an opinion on this matter. I was thinking that while I learn my family business under someone else’s guidance, I also prepare myself for CFA. Since I am already a Finance undergrad, I will be furthering my studies in my field of interest. This would mean I can learn about how to handle a business and earn a CFA (provided I pass).

Business/Finance,Did you know that most of the income accruing to political parties is exempt from tax,30,794ep0,metheist,9,"Section 13A of Income Tax Act 1961 reads out the following provision.

Any income of a political party which is chargeable under the head ""Income from house property"" or ""Income from other sources"" or ""Capital gains"" or any income by way of voluntary contributions received by a political party from any person shall not be included in the total income of the previous year of such political party :

Provided that—

(a) such political party keeps and maintains such books of account and other documents as would enable the Assessing Officer to properly deduce its income therefrom;

(b) in respect of each such voluntary contribution 12[other than contribution by way of electoral bond] in excess of twenty thousand rupees, such political party keeps and maintains a record of such contribution and the name and address of the person who has made such contribution; 13[and]

(c) the accounts of such political party are audited by an accountant as defined in the Explanation below sub-section (2) of section 288 14[; and] :

Following clause (d) and Explanation shall be inserted after clause (c) of the first proviso to section 13A by the Finance Act, 2017, w.e.f. 1-4-2018 :

(d)  no donation exceeding two thousand rupees is received by such political party otherwise than by an account payee cheque drawn on a bank or an account payee bank draft or use of electronic clearing system through a bank account or through electoral bond.


To explain it out for you, it basically states that any income except the one chargeable from business or profession is exempt from tax provided that the party abides by certain conditions.

And before you jump to conclusions, insertion of this provision was long before and is being shamelessly brought forward by all of the previous governments needless to say the current government too.

I'm fairly certain that the level of mathematics is that of 6th - 10th grades.


[This article](http://totalgadha.com/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=1952) seems to make more sense.


Moreover, NRIs who take admission in Indian engineering colleges receive the shock of their lives when they see that their fellow batchmates are already quite familiar with concepts of calculus that the SAT does not test at all. As a result, many of these students end up failing math in their first semester and might even begin a downward spiral due to depression.


Every year I keep hearing talks of IIMs wanting to be more like foreign b-schools where majority of the batch does not hail from an engineering background, but from commerce/business backgrounds. But it's not just about MBA programs. Even the batch profile of the Msc Finance program at JBIMS reveals that out of the 30 students it takes in, majority have engineering background.


I appeared for the interview at JBIMS. I'm a BBA - Finance grad and was asked what subjects I studied in BBA. I told them the subjects (Management accounting, strategic financial managemnt, etc.) and they countered asking, ""If you have already studied these subjects in graduation, why do you want to study them again in post grad?"". And here I thought that it would make more sense for business and commerce grads to pursue an MFin because that is much more coherent than jumping over to MFin from engineering.

Business/Finance,5 reasons why layoff in India can be especially hard ?,27,6cfxc8,mydigitalstartup,21,"""Top 5 reasons why layoff in India can be especially hard"" 

Do you agree? 

1. Social stigma: The middle-class in India attaches a lot of ‘status’ to what one does for a living. Among the first questions one gets asked during introductions include “where do you work?” (or “Where does your husband work?”). “He used to work for Infosys and just got laid-off” doesn’t cut it.  

2. Identity and self-worth: Typical middle-class kids are conditioned to work hard to succeed. When one is laid-off due to factors beyond one’s control (‘business reasons’) one begins to question one’s basic values. 

3. Pressure from relatives: Those from an earlier generation – parents, uncles and relatives of IT workers – equate ‘layoff’ to ‘firing.’ Right after layoff, they may begin to gossip “Ramesh was fired by Wipro. I though he was doing well there. What did he do wrong?” 

4. Financial challenges : Many IT workers over-leveraged their finances by “Investing” in expensive, upscale apartments, houses, cars and white-goods with large EMIs and credit card payments. Sudden stoppage of a paycheck can certainly be hard. 

5. Other practical challenges:  Many of those who are being laid-off are single and in their twenties and early thirties. Until recently, an ‘IT groom’ with a nice paycheck was a prime-catch in the matrimonial market. All the news of doom-and-gloom in IT sector is perhaps making families with eligible brides and grooms re-think alliances from those in IT sector.

The Lok Sabha functioned without even a *single minute* of adjournment during business. This was only the third session in the history of the universe when a Lok Sabha session functioned oh-so-smoothly. 

I will let the Speaker of the House Sumitra Mahajan explain it:

Hello /r/India,

In this edition of Last Week in Indian Parliament, we talk about the great ‘Pillar Fight’; quorum of the house and the absence of it; and how Rajya Sabha turned into a nukkad Ganpati Utsav culture day. 

I also wanted to write about: ""The Enforcement of Security Interest and (*takes a deep breath*) Recovery of Debts Laws and Miscellaneous Provisions (AMENDMENT) Bill, 2016 to amend the Securitisation and (*takes another deep breath*) Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 a.k.a the SARFAESI Act""

But then I realized it requires a whole new post.

So let's get right into it!

___

#“Hon’ble Members…”

#“Absent, Madam.”
___

The Budget session adjourned sine-dine on Friday for Rajya Sabha and on Wednesday for Lok Sabha. I can’t even count how many times during this session I heard the quorum bell ringing shrill, begging the members to come inside the house and let the business continue.

For the uninitiated, quorum is the minimum number of members that have to be present for the business in the house to be conducted. Under article 100(3) of the Constitution, for both houses of Parliament and State Assemblies, the quorum is one-tenth of the total strength of the house. So basically, in Lok Sabha, 53 members need to be present in order to let the house function.

Here’s the funny thing though, the quorum is considered only if a member present in the house brings it to the notice of the speaker. There is a certain ‘young’ Congress MP who can be spotted constantly counting the number of members present (I can’t name this person, for obvious reasons). The moment he sees that the members are below 53, he screams, “MADAMMMM! QUORUMMMM!?” 

Then he sits back with a smirk on his face as the speaker sighs, halts the business and the quorum bell rings.

**Fun fact**: There are two different sounding (and extremely shrill) quorum bells for Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. They can be heard throughout the premises and all conversations are cut short. There are separate sounding bells for division of the house calls too. The members are supposed to rush into the house when these bells ring. Super irritating, if you ask me. If it were upto me, I would use the following as quorum bells:

[Lok Sabha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_W2jONIjrM0)

[Rajya Sabha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTWKbfoikeg)

**Fun Fact 2:** The Quorum bell was rung when the Finance Bill and Aadhaar Bill were being considered. It was rung multiple times when the debate on Water Crisis was underway. Gives you an idea about the state of affairs.

**Why was the Lok Sabha adjourned early?**

Because the government didn’t seem to have any legislative business left. The Lok Sabha was supposed to continue till May 13, but was shut down on May 11. 

After the Uttarakhand Appropriation bill was passed, there was nothing left to do. So, as an afterthought, the discussion on drought and water crisis continued for two days. Since the session is coinciding with five state elections, a lot of members were absent from the house. I don’t recall AIADMK MPs participating even in a single debate this session. So basically, maintaining quorum was becoming a big issue and probably that’s why they decided to adjourn Lok Sabha early.

#Pillar Fight!
___

There has been a silent battle raging between our Judiciary, Legislature and Executive. In the past one month, there are many seemingly disconnected events that happened, but if you look closer you will see a tiny silk thread running through them all. Last week, during a debate on Uttarakhand appropriating bill, the Pillar Fight came to the forefront. The story is quite convoluted, so hold on to your [tin-foil hats](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/6/69852/3449330-tumblr_loq5o7rd4n1qzl8s1o1_400.gif)!

**The Battle of Uttarakhand**

The Uttarakhand ‘crisis’ came to a conclusion last week after Harish Rawat won the floor test, got on to his horse and [galloped away into the sunset](https://67.media.tumblr.com/ff9fd687b5bb1a3256eef3428074b7bb/tumblr_nytqw4xu7G1u9i37so1_400.gif). The floor test was ordered by the Supreme Court and it was to take place without the speaker of the 70 member assembly conducting it. The whole hand-raising ceremony was recorded and the video was sent to SC for verification. News Channels were showing Rawat praying to god almighty for saving his seat and, in the process, getting a lot of sympathy from his voters.

(**PERSONAL POLITICAL COMMENT:** I won’t be surprised if, come February, he goes around the state, addressing election rallies and screaming “MODI TRIED TO CONQUER US! BUT WE FRIKKIN WON!!” The ‘outsider invaded our land’ pitch can be quite compelling. Remember Independence Day? No no, not the Indian Freedom Struggle, I was talking about the movie where aliens attack and humans win and then everyone makes out in the end and are all happy and shit. Same thing. So, well done BJP!)


**Uttarakhand Appropriation Bill, 2016** 

>“Speaker is the roxxx. He/she is Supreme”

>~ Indian National Congress


Before the crucial floor test happened on Tuesday, the government of the day seemed to be in a weird sort of hurry to get the state’s budget passed in Parliament on Monday. I’m yet to figure out why but the Finance Minister, in his opening statement, said that this was being passed so that the state can continue with its expenditure for the next four months. He said, if the budget is not passed by the Assembly, the state won’t be allowed to spend any money.

[Jaitley Logic](http://imgur.com/RCstARp)

The president’s rule (under Rule 356) was imposed on Uttarakhand on 27th March 2016, a day before the floor test was supposed to happen. Since then, the assembly has been in a state of ‘suspended animation’. The central government was of the opinion that the Speaker of the Uttarakhand Assembly did not conduct the house as per the book, that he let the state budget pass even though the Uttarakhand Government didn’t have the required votes.

[What if the Speaker is being a complete ass?](http://imgur.com/rX785ih)

Members of INC argued here that the speaker (Pillar of Legislature) has a right to conduct the house as he/she pleases. They also held the belief that the Court (Pillar of Judiciary) has a right to question the decision of the President (Pillar of Executive) too. On, 21st April, the Nainital High Court had scrapped the President’s Rule in Uttarakhand, thus challenging the President. 

**Aadhaar Bill, 2016**

> “Speaker is the suxxx. He/she is NOT Supreme.”

> ~ Indian National Congress

Now here's the weird part. 

Incidentally, in case of the Aadhaar Bill, 2016, the Indian National Congress has challenged the Lok Sabha Speaker’s decision to classify the Aadhaar Bill as a money bill. Jairam Ramesh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court, the hearing for which is scheduled soon. I have been talking about this case for a while now, so you can read more about it [here](http://www.policypeepul.com/blog/2016/5/11/the-aadhar-bill-is-it-a-risk-worth-taking).

In this case, INC has argued that the speaker (Pillar of Legislature) is *not* supreme and her decision can be challenged by the Court (Pillar of Judiciary). 

I know I know. It’s utterly confusing. It’s also rather amusing how INC can speak in favour *and* against the same bloody thing. Takes some talent to pull it off.

**So which pillar wins?**

Zoom out a little. 

Imagine these three pillars, side by side. 

The height of the Legislative Pillar is decided by a party’s strength in the Parliament. At the moment, the Pillar of Legislature is standing tall (#MudiRoxx). As with the case with every party in power at the center, they try to find ways and means to infringe and cut down the powers of the other two pillars. 

*In the case of Uttarakhand Assembly*, Legislature was taken over by Executive and both of these pillars were shot down by the Judiciary.

*In the case of Aadhaar Bill*, the Judiciary is challenging the Legislature by questioning its highest functionary, the speaker. Since the Bill has been assented to by the President, they also end up challenging the Executive. If the SC rules that Aadhaar is #NotAMoneyBill and strike it down, it gives a decision against the Executive too.

This battle was underlined by Arun Jaitley with a singular suggestion to the Speaker of Lok Sabha, that if the Supreme Court summons her in the Aadhaar case: **She should ignore them!**

[Madam Speaker, ignore. Just ignore.](http://imgur.com/Lf89cDo)

[Obligatory song dedicated to Mr Jaitley](https://youtu.be/1M8vei3L0L8?t=26s)

The Pillar Fight rages on and much popcorn has been consumed in the process. I am single-handedly making Act II profitable.

I leave you with an interesting comment made by Kalikesh Singh Deo during the Uttarakhand debate:

#Rajya Sabha Association prijhents “Bye Bye Honourable Members Mohatsav”
___

53 members retired from the Rajya Sabha last week after serving 6 years in the house, being awesome and stuff. Prime Minister Modi gave a [farewell speech] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k-HZIMs9xc) on the occasion, which is worth giving a watch (HINDI ALERT).

Before you go further, let me say, **“No. The BJP will not get majority in the Rajya Sabha by 2019.”**

[Here’s a good article explaining why](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/in-this-term-modi-govt-will-never-have-the-numbers-in-rajya-sabha/)
___
**Psst... Umm… Noob question: How are Rajya Sabha Members elected?**

*Don’t be embarrassed if you don’t know! Let me give you a simple rundown of how this whole shindig works. If you already know, feel free to skip this part.*

To put it simply, Rajya Sabha (aka State Council) Members are elected by the people you elect for state assemblies. There is a proportional voting system in place which decides how many members from different political parties will represent a state in the upper house. 

IRL, the party boss decides who gets a Rajya Sabha ticket. The majority political party in the assembly gets to send more members than other parties. The number of RS seats per state are decided according to the population of the state. A member elected for Rajya Sabha serves a term of six years.

The Rajya Sabha, unlike the Lok Sabha, is *never* dissolved. 1/3rd Members of RS resign every two years making the house a perpetual entity. [Here](http://164.100.47.5/Newmembers/memberstatewise.aspx) is a list of the seats held by each state, present vacancies and other such details.

The Rajya Sabha bid a tearful adieu to retiring members who were given a chance to express their emotions. They did express their emotions and how! I have done the painstaking job of going through the debates and pulling out interesting bits which turned the Rajya Sabha into a *nukkad sabha*. 

Much fun was had!

*(Most of this was in Hindi, so for the benefit of my non-hindi speaking [comarades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NJbxEgf3Uo), I will try to translate it in a crude manner.)*

- Ram Gopal Yadav (Samajwadi Party) [recalled an anecdote](http://imgur.com/qjtuXlz): Two American politicians were sitting together discussing the relevance of the Senate (Upper House). The Senator amongst them was sipping tea, he simply blew on the tea and looked back at the other. “What does this mean?” asked the noob amongst the two. The Senator replied, “The Upper house cools down the decisions taken by the lower house. It’s like cooling tea so you don’t burn your tongue.”

- SS Roy (Trinamool Congress) [broke into a Mukesh song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDbwkKDWJ-4), explaining (in poetic terms) how members of Rajya Sabha will come back if the High Command wishes them to do so.

- Chandan Mitra (Bharatiya Janata Party) [recalled the lines of Faiz Ahmed Faiz](http://imgur.com/mUekcBY):

>“You know and I know,

> Both of our paths separate today,

> Even if you travel far, do remember me,

> Never say goodbye, Never say goodbye.”

- Chairman Hamid Ansari (The Coolest Man Alive) [trolled](http://imgur.com/Pf9anKg) Tarun Vijay (BJP) by asking him to use his immense rhetorical skills and confine the speech to three minutes. Jaya Bachchan joined the trolling my asking members who speak too much to conclude their speech in two lines. #AnsariRocks

Business/Finance,Its been 60 days. Why can't she just get over it?,155,33uoij,SerialRapistWhoAmI,119,"There is this girl I know. I initially befriended her, then did some business with her, and eventually convinced her into agreeing to live with me.

Then for 200 days, I raped her. I brainwashed her, I taught her what to think, and I raped her some more.

But I also fed her, took care of her medical expenses, and introduced her to Netflix - something she'd have never experienced the joy of if she wasn't my captive. 

After about 200 days, it was becoming difficult for me to keep hold of her. My finances were in ruin due to other issues so I decided to free her. I gave her the freedom to leave and patted myself on the back for freeing her.

Meanwhile, during her time as my sex-slave, she developed a Stockholm syndrome - a part of her had fallen in love with me and started to look up to me, glorify me, and imitate me.  

However, since I set her free, she hasn't been able to do well. She's not been able to find a job, not been able to create any savings, has a dysfunctional thought process, cannot execute things properly. 

But  it has been 60 days since I set her free. If she can't get her things in order in such a long time, how can anyone blame my 200 days of rape for it? 

I mean if she can't get her house in order even after 60 days, its completely her fault. A large part of her even agrees with me on this.

However, there is this small part of her brain that keeps talking about how she has PTSD from my rape. I keep telling her that this is a deluded fascist part of her brain that is making up fiction about how it could have been if I had not raped her. I mean duh, she'd have never heard of Netflix. Besides, everyone else was raping too so its not really my fault.

In any case, this fascist part of her brain talks about justice and vengeance against me for my rape. But I prefer to ignore and not talk about those old days. Sometimes I even tell her that the rape was good for her. I suggest that its best we ignore the past and build on our special relationship and continue to work together for a better future for the both of us. She agrees with me for the most part except when her fascist mindset kicks in.

Business/Finance,"I feel I am being economically forced to choose a career (MBA) that I don't necessarily want(?), while my true passion lies somewhere else.",10,85cyx9,AK41781995,9,"TDLR: I got a offer letter from a good MBA university in India, but I don't feel my passion truly lies in MBA, rather it lies in bio-sciences. However, career in pure sciences isn't exactly promising and stable, definitely not in India, but maybe abroad.

Last year I completed my BSc from Mumbai University with fairly nice grades and I am currently at the end of 1st year of my MSc. I hate it here. I don't feel like I am learning anything new at all. It's repetition of what we did in BSc. I want to leave this MSc to go for a MS in Germany (Not any other country because I can only afford the tuition fee subsidised German education, not even the elite science institutes in India because lack of a MS in bio engineering, the pathetic state of research in India even in the elite instis, the horrible scientific culture of India, in short I don't want to study science in India.) in TU Dresden or Munich or Max planck or similar. I have friends there who are just on my head to give IELTS and apply for my dream MS institute. My dad now feebly supports this plan too so no family problem.

There are some major caveats to this career line. Firstly it is too hyper specialised and in it's infancy. Very few businesses are offering jobs to bio engineers. So my best option is to stay there in Germany and do a PhD. Not that it is a terrible option but again the question of 'then what' arises. This is more of less the same situation in every pure science field with a lot of unknowns and variables. What I desperately want to avoid is being in a situation where I am not getting opportunities in Germany and I have to come back home with a degree that isn't worth anything in India. 

This is one option that I have currently which isn't promising, I haven't even applied to these institutes yet. Too much uncertainty with respect to career, financing and opportunities. But it has my passion. And passion isn't something I say lightly. I am so interested in fields biology that I have that I have spent hours and hours of reading one Wikipedia article after another like a crack addict drugging himself to keep his high. Here I am referring just one page of an interesting topic and boom 8 hours later, I have 50 tabs open on my browser and I am reading a research paper on tissue engineering and its future applications. One could say I am passionate about biology. 

The problem is, I also like making money. I will just say it flatly. I am just as passionate of making money as I am passionate of biology. And it is difficult to have a comfortable career in Biology AND owning that house I dream of or buying that latest PC rig or god forbid, a good retirement plan. I have seen what lack of money did to my family and I never want to be in a position where I have to borrow money from someone or rent some shitty apartment. I want to provide for my future wife and children.(I know this prospect is little premature for that but still.)

Hence I went into the MBA rat race, joined classes, studied, and after a hellish year of self loathing and realising how pathetic I am in maths, I have an offer letter from one of the top ten B-schools of India. It isn't some MBA finance or some god level MBA, I just don't have the calibre for it and I didn't score high enough on the tests for fiance, but it is MBA in pharmaceuticals. The course is amazing. A lot of learning opportunities, 100% placement, average package 8 lakhs, lowest 6, highest 14, lot of field experience and 2 or 3 seniors last year bagged international placements in pharma MNCs. Kewl.

Everyone around me is elated and happy and congratulating me and I am here sitting just confused more than ever. It is indeed a big break for me, I have been depressed and miserable for 2 years, tensed about what I will do in life. So a part of me ( and my dad ) feel I should just accept what is on my plate right now and not demand for something better. 

The truth is, my MBA entrance exam attempts this year wasn't even 60% of my total potential. And I feel I could do a lot better and get that prestigious MBA Finance from NMIMS, JB, XLRI, or some mid tier IIMs. IIM ABC ka aukaad nai hai mera so I am not even thinking of those. My CMAT score was 96 percentile. What if I score better next year? If I choose MBA pharma this year, there's no turning back, I will be propelled in the pharma industry. I don't know how to sell drugs.

I feel I am being economically forced to choose MBA, but I am not exactly complaining because MBA has money, science doesn't, while science has my passion, but no money. I know I am making a blanket statement here but certainly there are exceptions, but you get my general idea right. I know that I should have made this decision long ago, but I didn't feel like I will get into any good B school.

One small possibility I see is, doing an MBA in pharma and working in a biomedical devices company which is something close to my passion. 

MBAs of reddit, scientists of reddit in india and overseas, and anyone who might have some suggestions, what should I do? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each option? What would you do? I have to confirm my MBA admission in 10 days. I have only 10 days to decide how I am going to lead the rest of my life. I would seriously appreciate some counsel. 

Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/85cyx9/i_feel_i_am_being_economically_forced_to_choose_a/

Banks & other financial institutions which are already providing such services have been given a window of **3 months** to terminate these services.

Even though the exchanges & crypto community in India are seeking remedial action against RBI's diktat, I am not very hopeful that we'll be able to get a stay order from the Supreme Court of India in favour of crypto-currencies. The primary reason for my skepticism being the *little to no understanding of the crypto world that Indian government possesses.* It's noteworthy and depressing at the same time that Finance Minister of India [compared cryptocurrencies to ponzi schemes late last year.](https://qz.com/1171183/bitcoin-is-neither-legal-nor-illegal-in-india-and-everyones-confused/)

Not many users out here know that [Indian crypto markets crashed flat 25-30%](http://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/with-rbi-s-near-ban-announcement-cryptocurrency-prices-crash-sharply-118040501410_1.html) in less than an hour of RBI notification on **April 5, 2018** because of panic selling by investors whereas the foreign exchanges didn't show any substantial fluctuations because of the same.

This decline in value is sure to repeat at the end of the 3 months window (keeping in mind the **assumption** that RBI's decision holds at the end of these 3 months) with a greater percentage fall this time because investors will not be able to convert their fiat to crypto anymore in India for the immediate future. Personally, I won't be much surprised if XRP value comes down to 0.05$-0.10$ at that time. Without any exception, same shall be the fate of other VCs too.

So, the opportunity lies for those who have accounts with foreign banks since they shall be able to procure cryptocurrencies at dirt cheap prices here in India and be able to sell them abroad at the normal prices prevailing in world markets. This shall be beneficial for both categories of people, those looking to profit out of arbitrage and those intending to HODL them. I admit this post benefits only some investors based on their geographical presence and not the cryptoverse at large but one should make the most of what she/he has. *When life throws rocks at you, build a fort out of them.* ;)

**#Brexit Update**

This isn’t the first time that a Brexit story is here, and it’s certainly not going to be the last. The Brexit referendum is the European news media’s Donald Trump - they’re going to milk the story for all it’s worth for years to come. The country is attempting a preemptive strike against the economic downturn that all the prophecies have predicted now that it is moving out of EU. Accordingly, the UK finance minister has [announced](http://in.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-osborne-idINKCN0ZJ0VN) plans to cut corporate tax rates from 20% to 15%. For some context, most developed countries average a corporate tax rate of 25%, India taxes at 35%. As the UK’s currency fell to 31-year lows in the foreign exchange markets, the Bank of England (UK’s central bank) [eased](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/05/bank-of-england-releases-150bn-pounds-risks-financial-stability) regulations on banks which freed up £150 billion that banks can lend to people and businesses. How does any of this relate to India? UK’s Business Secretary Sajid Javid (who sports a forehead that rivals that of Sonakshi Sinha’s) is [going](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/brexit-india-uk-to-hold-trade-talks/article8823969.ece) on a world tour of nations including India to hold discussions about a possible trade treaty. Seriously, google him right now. His head is more forehead than face. 

**LPT: Don’t Be Hungry In Kerala**

Incredible India is all good, but have you tasted the food here? Clearly, India is a fat man’s paradise. If you leave out Kerala, that is. The state just [imposed](http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/fat-tax-introduced-in-kerala-14-5-to-be-levied-on-fast-food-chains-like-mcdonalds-1429427) a 14.5% tax on food that makes you fatter, like burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, donuts etc. While subsidies are often used to encourage consumption of certain things, on the flip side, taxes are often used to discourage consumption of certain things. And Kerala’s government just wants to discourage fat people from being fat. The move is expected to bring in additional revenue of ₹10 crore to the state while mostly affecting fast food chains like McDonalds, Subway, Pizza Hut etc. The idea of a ‘fat tax’ is nothing new - it’s been implemented in countries like Denmark and Hungary, a country that sounds a lot like hungry. Coincidence? Definitely, yeah.

**Banks: Desperate Times, Desperate Measures**

Months after the banks started drowning in a pool of bad loans, the water level has come up enough to inspire some desperate deals. The nation’s second largest lender, ICICI had loaned ₹3,000 crore to Essar Steel, the Ruia-family owned company. But Essar has fallen on pretty hard times and can’t pay the loans back. So the banks got together and started searching for someone who can buy a majority stake in Essar, takeover the management and turn the company around. But it’s all fun and games until reality sets in - which is that nobody wants to even touch Essar Steel with a ten-foot pole. Last week, realizing that a solution was unlikely, ICICI [sold](http://www.livemint.com/Industry/8CVTPujGZTeE2W7iBUr45M/ICICI-Bank-sells-Essar-Steel-loan-exposure-to-Edelweiss-ARC.html) those loans worth about ₹1,600 crore to Edelweiss. The Jaypee Group, known perhaps for its cement business, found itself in similar condition where it had borrowed just a little more than it could handle. Fortunately, somebody did touch that company with a ten-foot pole. The company [sold](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/buzzing-stocks/jp-associates-ultratech5-38rs-16189-cr-cement-deal_6982041.html) a lot of cement manufacturing plants to UltraTech Cement for ₹16,189 crore that it can potentially use to repay loans. To consolidate in times of trouble, State Bank of India is merging with its associate banks from Travancore, Mysore and others. But along with employees who fear being fired after the merger, a lot of businesses that are customers of the banks being acquired are [protesting](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/now-customers-too-voice-concern-over-sbi-associate-banks-merger/article8807858.ece) the merger. Why? Well, how would you like it if your local grocery shopkeeper who knows you by name suddenly sold out to Big Bazaar?

**Loans From Flipkart**

The list of top 3 disasters in India goes like this: 1) the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, 2) Sholay-remake *Ram Gopal Verma Ki Aag* and 3) Flipkart’s Big Billion Day. The online retailer’s annual big sales event that comes every year started in 2014 and fetched the company ₹650 crore. But it was marred by failure in shipping which resulted in thousands of frustrated customers, and the company has been trying to rebuild the Big Billion Day brand ever since. The second Big Billion Day happened last year, raked in ₹2,000 crore for the company and sailed through relatively easily. This time, however, Flipkart feels shaky on being able to deliver without a glitch. It’s [making](http://thetechportal.com/2016/07/05/flipkart-brings-back-big-billion-day-major-changes/) plans to have a one huge Big Billion Day in the first week of October, followed by similar smaller events to spread the orders around. At a time when banks are becoming more cautious about lending to certain sectors of the economy, Flipkart is also planning to play matchmaker between banks and borrowers by offering pre-approved loans so you can buy now, pay later. The company is in talks with banks to arrange the loans which will be paid back by Flipkart in case people just decide to run with their Flipkart-bought flat screens and laptops.

**Pandering To The Base**

Every politician does it. From the Donald in the US to Modi in India, it’s a political science lesson that crosses borders. As much as we parade the “developing-nation” tag around, India’s economy is still heavily dependant on agriculture as it employs almost two-thirds of the nation’s people. And these farmers also constitute Modi’s base and naturally, his government needs to pander to them before the forth-coming state elections. After a union budget that was largely seen as pro-farmer by earmarking almost $826 million (₹5,524 crore) for crop insurance plans, the government might play two more cards to appease the backbone of the economy. One, officials said last week that they are considering imposing a [penalty](http://www.reuters.com/article/india-crop-insurance-idUSL3N16U22P) on delaying of claim settlements for crop insurance. That’s when you buy insurance and if the rains don’t come in and your crops fail, you get paid a settlement. Two, the government is likely to extend the the current 25% wheat import tax which expires in March to continue [beyond](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-wheat-duty-idINKCN0WN1H7) March. The tax was imposed to shield domestic wheat farmers from cheap imports. Wasn’t exactly effective since wheat output in 2015 was down 10% from 2014, despite the tax.


**The Great Indian Addiction**

Indian people are addicted. It’s not a drug, gambling or internet addiction. It’s an addiction to gold. Gold imports make up a quarter of India’s trade deficit because we import almost 10 lakh kgs of gold annually. Billionaire Warren Buffett says about gold: “It doesn’t do anything but sit there and look at you.”  Clearly, Indian people think that Buffett uncle doesn’t know anything about gold. Rehabilitating the Indian people from this addiction can be hard but the government is trying. Recently, it introduced a 1% excise duty on imported gold jewellry. How did that go down? Jewellers went on an indefinite strike which was called off last week after [assurances](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-gold-strike-idINKCN0WM01T) that excise department officials won’t harass jewellers. The government also started a campaign to monetize the privately owned horde of Indian gold to cut down on imports. How has that worked out? The scheme only managed to attract 0.015% of the estimated horde of gold that is currently in family lockers and temple vaults. There was some golden news on that front last week as the iconic 200-year-old [Siddhivinayak](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-gold-siddhihvinayak-temple-idINKCN0WK1ZF) temple in Mumbai announced its participation in the scheme.

**Because Karma Is A Bitch**

Petty sabotage and backstabbing isn’t just limited to undercover spies and Indian politics anymore. The corporates are adopting these strategies as well. Last week, Uber filed a lawsuit at the Delhi High Court against its biggest Indian competitor, Ola. The lawsuit accuses Ola of creating 90,000 fake Uber accounts and using them to book over 400,000 rides, only to be cancelled at the last [moment](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/23/11292310/uber-ola-lawsuit-india-fake-rides-lyft). Classic prank by Ola, right? Except Uber claims that Ola did this to disrupt its operations and frustrate its drivers. And Uber would know that because it has been accused of doing the exact same thing to its biggest US competitor, Lyft. Two years ago, Lyft accused Uber of booking and cancelling over 5,000 rides using fake accounts that were traced back to Uber employees. If true, Ola will only have taken a page from Uber’s own playbook. If you’re a betting person, be sure to put your money on Uber - that company’s got deep pockets and can drag this out as long as it takes. It recently declared $1 billion (₹6,688 crore) in annual profits from it’s [top 30](http://www.newsweek.com/uber-profits-elsewhere-support-sustainable-spending-china-ceo-440705) cities alone. To be fair, they also said they were sustaining huge losses in China where the company holds a 30% market share.

**Auto Engines Are The New Moon Landing**

69th Richest Indian on the famous Forbes Rich-list and the co-founder of Infosys, Nandan Nilekani is known for investing in startups that focus on big, transformative ideas. In his investment portfolio is Team Indus, a company that aims to land a rover on the moon and Systemantics, a company that focuses on robots. Last week, Nilekani made his [biggest](http://thetechportal.in/2016/03/24/sedemac-mechatronics-funding/) startup investment yet in a company called Sedemac Mechatronics. What’s bigger than futuristic robots and landing on the moon? Time travel, perhaps? No, apparently, it’s building small engines and powertrains for auto companies. Nilekani led the latest round of funding in Sedemac which summed up to a total of $7.5 million (₹50 crore). Sedemac counts the big boys of the auto industry like Tata Motors, Mahindra Group, Ashok Leyland as its clients and was started by an engineering professor at IIT-B with a couple of fellow IITians.

**The Chinese Dragon Wants In On India**

The “Big Three” of e-commerce in India - Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon - will soon become the “Big Four” with the entry of Alibaba, the chinese e-commerce giant in India. Officials from the company that is poised to [surpass](http://www.businessinsider.in/Alibaba-on-course-to-become-worlds-top-retailer/articleshow/51507633.cms) the world’s biggest retailer, Walmart and claim that tag for itself, said last week that Alibaba was looking to expand its presence in India. It is looking to directly enter the online retail segment later this year. Run by China’s richest person, Jack Ma, the company already owns 40% of Paytm and 4% of Snapdeal. Are Indian e-commerce companies coming together like brothers-in-arms to fight off competition from this foreign entity? Of course no. The Indians didn’t unite when the British literally invaded and aren’t going to do that now with the Chinese either. In fact, Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal and his Snapdeal counterpart Kunal Bahl already found themselves in a war of words on [Twitter](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/flipkart-s-sachin-bansal-takes-jibe-at-alibaba-s-india-entry-116032600040_1.html) over Alibaba’s planned expansion in India. Alibaba, which still conjures images of forty thieves in one’s imagination, may tie up with the [Tatas](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-03-21/news/71705366_1_digital-india-alibaba-group-chairman-cyrus-mistry) to launch its online retail business as a joint-venture. This is because FDI regulations still don’t allow foreign companies to sell directly to Indian consumers, which is what Alibaba wants to do. Amazon, the US ambassador to the industry, merely connects buyers and sellers and doesn’t sell itself.

**Oli Gets Oil**

Nepal’s Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli recently took a trip up north to Beijing and stumbled his way into signing an agreement with China for the supply of petroleum products to [Nepal](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-nepal-idUSKCN0WP1WV). The country, which serves as a strategic buffer between India and China, adopted its first post-monarchy constitution last year. But protesters opposing the new constitution blocked trucks carrying fuel and essential goods coming from India. This five-month long “unofficial blockade” of Nepal had disastrous consequences for the Nepalese economy due to its overwhelming dependence on India. The distraught country says it now wants to import 33% of Nepal’s fuel from China in the future. Basically, after being deeply hurt by what the Indians did, Nepal is now looking for some quick rebound action from the Chinese. Indian officials, however, are far from alarmed that Nepal is trying to move away from the Indian sphere of influence. Why? Because there is this big huge chunk of rock called the Himalayas between Nepal and China.

Business/Finance,Some examples where credit ratings agencies have been disproven and discredited time and time again,13,7dskdq,kejjj12345,9,"Should Indian government really be celebrating? Here are some examples to think not - 

1.""In November 1998, the day after the Japanese Government announced a large-scale fiscal stimulus to its ailing economy, Moody’s Investors Service began the first of a series of downgradings of the Japanese Government’s yen-denominated bonds, by taking the Aaa (triple A) rating away. The next major Moody’s downgrade occurred on September 8, 2000.

Then, in December 2001, Moody’s further downgraded the Japan Governments yen-denominated bond rating to Aa3 from Aa2. On May 31, 2002, Moody’s Investors Service cut Japan’s long-term credit rating by a further two grades to A2, or below that given to Botswana, Chile and Hungary.

In a statement at the time, Moody’s said that its decision “reflects the conclusion that the Japanese government’s current and anticipated economic policies will be insufficient to prevent continued deterioration in Japan’s domestic debt position … Japan’s general government indebtedness, however measured, will approach levels unprecedented in the postwar era in the developed world, and as such Japan will be entering ‘uncharted territory’.”

The then Japanese Finance Minister responded (with some foresight): “They’re doing it for business. Just because they do such things we won’t change our policies … The market doesn’t seem to be paying attention.” Indeed, the Government continued to have no problems finding buyers for their debt, which is all yen-denominated and sold mainly to domestic investors. 
How … could a country that receives foreign aid from Japan have a better rating than Japan itself? Japan, with an economy almost 1,000 times the size of Botswana’s, has the world’s largest foreign reserves, $446 billion; the world’s largest domestic savings, $11.4 trillion; and about $1 trillion in overseas investments. And 95 percent of the debt is held by Japanese people 

In the New York Times[http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/06/business/international-business-japan-battles-bond-rating.html] the logic of the rating was questioned:

    How … could a country that receives foreign aid from Japan have a better rating than Japan itself?

2. Comment by formers President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and former member of the Federal Open Market Committee, Bob McTeer who is described as having “free-market views” which “gave the Dallas Fed its reputation during his tenure as “The Free-Enterprise Fed”” (Source). McTeer says:

    It may just be me, but aren’t the credit rating agencies supposed to be rating credit?

    Yesterday, we saw a sharp market reaction when one of the rating agencies that gave AAA ratings to mortgage-backed securities larded with subprime loans called into question the credit worthiness of Britain. As is the case with the United States and the Federal Reserve, Britain and its Bank of England have the ability to create new money if necessary to pay off its debt at maturity. There is no sovereign credit risk. There is no need for credit rating agencies to opine on the credit worthiness of sovereign debt.

    Sovereign debt is subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates in general rise, outstanding bonds, sovereign and non-sovereign, will decline in price, the extent depending on how close they are to maturity.

    Sovereign debt is also subject to inflation risk. Holders of the debt are harmed if inflation outpaces their expectations when they purchased the debt.

    When Standard & Poor questions British bonds, they must be making a judgment about some risk other than credit risk. Given time, investors will learn to take such questions with a grain of salt and not overreact. Meanwhile, haven’t they done enough harm for this cycle?""

3. ""Bizarrely, securities backed by mortgages sold to people without the income to service the debt they were taking on were being judged a better credit risk than the sovereign government of Japan, with the ability in extremis both to raise taxes and print money to avoid a default.""

4.""Ratings agencies admit mistakes - Credit rating agencies have admitted errors were made when assessing some of the financial instruments that have been blamed for the credit crunch.

Representatives of the three main agencies - Standard & Poor's, Fitch, Moodys - were grilled by MPs on the Treasury Select Committee.

They said that their assessment of securities backed by sub-prime mortgages turned out to be incorrect.

But they said these instruments were not too complex to rate accurately.

""The assumption that we made about how these assets would perform in the future turned out to be incorrect,"" said Ian Bell, head of European structured finance at Standard & Poor's.

Iceland role

Credit agencies carry out work to determine the worthiness or otherwise of financial investments.

They have been accused of failing to spot the size and risk of the bad US housing debt that was resold around the world, causing multi-billion-pound losses.

It was the discovery of these losses that caused the global credit markets to freeze up, and ultimately led to governments around the world having to bail out their banking sectors.

The ratings agencies said that credit ratings were just one factor that investors should look at when making investment decisions, but admitted that less sophisticated investors may have been over-reliant on their assessments.

The committee also criticised the agencies for failing to warn their clients adequately of the problems faced by the Icelandic economy before its banks collapsed last year.

Some 116 local councils deposited more than £858m in the failed banks, because they offered a relatively high return with a high credit rating.""

5.""Who's to Blame for the Economy? Rating Agencies - A good measure of who is responsible for getting us into this mess is looking at who got rich off of it. Bond ratings agencies certainly got their share of the take.

Moody's Investors Service ( MCO) saw its profits quadruple between 2000 and 2007 and had a higher profit margin than any other company in the S&P 500 for five straight years, according to opening statements from Henry Waxman, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Investigations, in a congressional hearing on the ratings agencies he held in October.""

6. "" In the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–2010, the rating agencies came under criticism from investigators, economists, and journalists. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC)[39] set up by the US Congress and President to investigate the causes of the crisis, and publisher of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report (FCIR), concluded that the ""failures"" of the Big Three rating agencies were ""essential cogs in the wheel of financial destruction"" and ""key enablers of the financial meltdown"".[40] It went on to say

    The mortgage-related securities at the heart of the crisis could not have been marketed and sold without their seal of approval. Investors relied on them, often blindly. In some cases, they were obligated to use them, or regulatory capital standards were hinged on them. This crisis could not have happened without the rating agencies. Their ratings helped the market soar and their downgrades through 2007 and 2008 wreaked havoc across markets and firms.""

8. Moody's And Japan - But think about the Moodys statement in relation to Japan. The logic (and that is being kind) goes like this:

             1. Economic growth is low in Japan and is pushing tax revenue down and welfare spending up – hence the budget deficit rises.

              2. Given the Japanese government doesn’t exercise its legal right to spend without issuing debt to match the spending, the rising budget deficit (as a result of the cyclical downturn) also means rising public debt.

             3. Moodys asserts (with no analytical or conceptual basis provided) that these rising deficits are in some way a problem per se (rather than being a reflection of the real problem – slow growth).

            4. So in their Pavlovian fashion, they downgrade the credit rating presumably suggesting the Japanese government is a credit risk without acknowledging the Japanese government can never be an credit risk unless there is a collective brain explosion and the Government legislates to renege on its financial obligations.

            5. They downgrade because the slow growth makes it more difficult to reduce the budget deficit without acknowledging that the budget deficit should increase to meet the challenge of slow growth.

           6. But then you are left to ask two questions. First, the Moodys logic would suggest they want to increase the borrowing costs of the Japanese government by reducing the demand for bonds (because the lower rating is meant to scare investors) which if you believed their type of reasoning would further negatively impact on economic growth. So what sort of logic is that? Moodys (if you had their model outlook) is saying the Japanese economy is damaged because of the recession but we are going to make it worse and therefore worsen the problem of credit risk.

           7. Second, of-course, neither their implicit notion that Japanese government debt carries a credit risk or that their ratings change anything anyway are valid. Note that a sign that government paper was not an attractive investment prospect might be rising yields as investors avoided demanding the paper. But Moodys acknowledges that there is an “undiminished home bias of Japanese investors and their preference for government bonds, which allows the government’s fiscal deficits to be funded at the lowest nominal rates globally”.

So who would you bet on? A corrupt capitalist firm that has made some monumental mistakes in the past while handing out AAA ratings to firms who were paying them to rate their products or millions of investors who every day purchase Japanese government debt at stable and the lowest yields? The same investors who have been buying Japanese government debt while deficits have been rising and public debt ratios heading up beyond 200 per cent (compared to the ridiculous Reinhardt Rogoff default threshold of 80 per cent) for the last 20 years.""

Source - http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=15787

8. ""What mindless rule is being applied here?

The whole thing is mindless. To repeat, the logic appears to be: Cut deficits to keep the Aaa rating – but that would undermine growth and push up the deficit and debt – which undermines the Aaa rating.

And the politicians and everyone else goes along with this nonsense. We really are not a very bright race of people.""

**Apple’s New China Is India**

When Steve Jobs, ex-hippie and the founder of Apple, visited India in the 1970s, he wore a lungi and [roamed](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/others/news/what-steve-jobs-did-in-india-35-years-ago-225246) barefoot. Until, of course, the Indian national disease of diarrhea cut his trip short and sent him back to the US. Fortunately for all of us, when Tim Cook, the current CEO of Apple, visited India last week his attire did not include a lungi and he probably drank bottled water, as is tradition for all foreign tourists in India. In between wild Bollywood parties at SRK’s house and IPL matches in Kanpur, Tim [announced](http://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-tim-cook-samples-bollywood-cricket-in-bid-to-woo-india-1463822223) a startup accelerator in Bengaluru and the opening of two new offices including one in Hyderabad. It wasn’t all play and no work - Tim met with businessmen like the CEOs of ICICI Bank, Vodafone India, TCS and heads of state like Prime Minister Modi, the Telangana CM and many more. But why India and why now? After reporting the first quarterly decline in sales that was largely caused due to slowing growth in China, Apple is now searching for something other than China to fuel growth for the coming decade. And Apple’s next China might just be India. Tim termed his visit to India as ‘fantastic’ but then again, he also ran into Alia Bhatt. So it’s entirely possible that his statements were laced with sarcasm.  

**The One With Trump, Brexit and India**

Britain, the former colonial master of India and more countries than you can even name, is going through an independence movement of its own. Currently, the country is a part of the European Union, a political and economic union of 28 countries in Europe. In a public vote to be held on June 23rd, Britishers will decide if the nation will stay in the European Union or get out of the European Union. All of that may be Britain’s headache but a new report out of SBI [suggests](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-brexit-can-open-up-opportunities-for-india-sbi-research-report-2212552) that even though a Brexit (Britain leaving the European Union) could be terrible for Europe, it could turn out to be hugely beneficial for India since Indian companies will no longer need to follow complex trade agreements while dealing with Britain. Likewise, a former US Diplomat says a Trump presidency in the US, while [terrible](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/if-donald-trump-becomes-us-president-india-may-gain-at-chinas-expense-heres-why/articleshow/52380459.cms) for China and Pakistan (...not to mention Mexico) might actually turn out to be great for India as ~~Donald Trump~~ Dear Leader’s foreign policies are likely to shift the balance of power in Asia in favour of India. The word to describe what you’re feeling right now is schadenfreude - taking pleasure in the misfortunes of others. Trust me, *I know words. I have the best [words.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T-Eo0j092Q)*

**The Banking Bloodbath**

With the whole bad loans crisis being shoved in everyone’s faces, it’s no surprise that banks are feeling the heat. Saddled with a ton of losses caused by increasing net non-performing assets (the fancy term for bad loans), conditions are becoming dire. A host of smaller banks reported earnings last week and it’s not good. If you have a phobia of falling bank profits, turn away now and seek professional help because it’s about to get gruesome. Alright, [here](http://www.livemint.com/Money/1MpJ5uNbQXhacOWKTo3PWJ/PSU-banks-shares-fall-after-weak-earnings.html) we go: Dena Bank reported a loss of ₹326 crore, Allahabad Bank reported a loss of ₹581 crore, Central Bank of India reported a loss of ₹898 crore, UCO Bank reported a loss of ₹1,715 crore and Syndicate Bank [reported](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/results/syndicate-bank-q4-loss-at-rs-2158cr-provisions-jump-3-fold_6677621.html) a loss of ₹2,158 crore. Going for the silver medal is Bank of Baroda with a loss of ₹3,230 crore, the second highest loss in the history of Indian banking. And now, for the gold medal, the worst loss in the history of Indian banking ever was reported at a record-breaking ₹5,367 crore by *drumroll* Punjab National Bank. It feels good to have found the rock-bottom at last. At least now, there is nowhere to go but up. That’s what investors in bank stocks are saying to themselves so they can sleep well at night. Let’s hope for their sake that we don’t find a new bottom in the next quarter.

**|| || || > | | | | | |**

So you might’ve heard: The banking industry is in a bit of a tight spot. There haven’t been any bankruptcies (phew) yet. But there’s blood on the streets. And the only way to patch the wound is to stick together in times of trouble. State Bank of India, one of the largest banks in India, [proposed](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/industries/article-bank-of-india-says-no-talks-on-merging-with-any-other-lenders-1408323) a plan to stick together and merge with its 5 associate banks: State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Travancore, State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Mysore plus the newly created Bharatiya Mahila Bank. If merged, the combined bank will become a banking behemoth with 50 crore customers. And behemoths don’t bleed easy. Taking cue, the government is also urging UCO Bank, Bank of India and Indian Overseas Bank (all of whom have reported losses) to find themselves a relatively well off bank and merge their losses away. Playing the merger game is tricky business. You don’t want your merger to be like Romeo and Juliet. Sure, they made history but they both died in the end. You want your merger to be like Aladdin and Princess Jasmine. One that can live happily ever after.

* Chalk this one up to the Romeo and Juliet category of mergers - the Chairman and Managing Director of Air India, Mr. Lohani has [blamed](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/air-india-merger-led-to-a-mess-ashwani-lohani/article8621785.ece) the distraught airline’s debt and losses on the 2011 merger of Air India and Indian Airlines. Mr. Lohani, who took over the basket case of an airliner just last year, seems to have lost all hope as he stated that Air India has a bureaucracy bigger than even the Indian Railways, the mother-load of all bureaucracies.

* After the rise of Flipkart and the likes, everyone and their mother is getting in on the ecommerce game. The Tatas are now [launching](https://inc42.com/flash-feed/tata-group-enter-ecommerce-space-launch-cliq/) CliQ, an online retailer selling apparel, electronics, footwear and more from over 80 brands. This comes right after Arvind Ltd. (the Indian partner of brands like Arrow, Lee, Wrangler etc.) launched its ecommerce play, NNNow.com (I didn’t have a seizure, that’s the actual name). This also comes months after the Reliance Group launched ajio.com and the Aditya Birla Group launched abof.com.

* Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka is making some serious coin - Sikka, who has boosted all the numbers that matter since taking over in 2014, will be [paid](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/vishal-sikka-kicks-in-big-salary-spikes-at-infosys/articleshow/52287712.cms) ₹74 crore including stock options this year, which works out to 116 times the median salary of Infosys employees. Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys, however has in the past suggested that the highest salary paid in a company shouldn’t be more than 25 times the lowest salary paid in the company.

* Vijay Mallya, who has indirectly paid the salaries of thousands of journalists around the world along with Donald Trump, is scared. He’s scared that Indians will come after him with pitchforks if he ever returns from the UK. Accordingly, Mallya [says](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/vijay-mallya-fugitive-businessman-consider-india-return-if-safety-freedom-assured-1560279) he’ll only return if his safety and freedom is assured. GOI’s formal request to the British government to extradite Mallya was declined. More problems to boot: A ₹2.4 crore dividend payable to Mallya from United Breweries was withheld.

They say there’s no use digging up old corpses. And declassifying old government records can sometimes certainly feel like digging up old corpses. Well, this time the government might have found a zombie. After releasing old records relating to the Azad Hind Bank, founded by Subhash Chandra Bose, many borrowers have [approached](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-05-16/news/73126343_1_currency-notes-bank-notes-legal-tender) the finance ministry asking the government to recognize the currency issued by the Azad Hind Bank in 1944 as legal tender, so they can use it to repay existing loans. In a country of more than a billion people, there’s potential for more than a billion bizarre stories. And this is just one. 

$1 billion is the number of the week for Apple. $1 billion is the amount that Warren Buffett, the billionaire that has traditionally and even proudly shunned technology, has [invested](http://www.economist.com/news/business/21699139-meaning-two-odd-and-connected-investments-1-billion-stakes-menu) in Apple shares over the last quarter. $1 billion is also the amount that Apple invested in Didi, not the Bengali politician, but Uber’s competitor in China. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick’s girlfriend, reportedly owns shares of Apple, which makes her an investor in Didi. That’s got to make for some very awkward pillow talk.

Previous week's thread : [Indian Startups Last Week](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/513183/indian_startups_this_week/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5276xk/indian_startups_this_week_5th_sept_11th_sept/
Business/Finance,I am forwarding an interesting story about world economy. How valid is it? I leave it to you. Another whatsapp forward,10,7jrv4g,yasar434,8,"Amazing logic indeed. This is a crazy world! Interesting article written by an Indian Economist

Japanese save a lot. They do not spend much. Also, Japan exports far more than it imports. Has an annual trade surplus of over 100 billion. Yet Japanese economy is considered weak, even collapsing.

Americans spend, save little. Also US imports more than it exports.
Has an annual trade deficit of over $400 billion. Yet, the American economy is considered strong and trusted to get stronger.

But where from do Americans get money to spend? They borrow from Japan, China and even India.
Virtually others save for the US to spend. Global savings are mostly invested in US, in dollars.

India itself keeps its foreign currency assets of over $50 billion in US securities. China has sunk over $160 billion in US securities.
Japan's stakes in US securities is in trillions.

Result:
The US has taken over $5 trillion from the world. So, as the world
saves for the US - It's The Americans who spend freely. Today, to keep the US consumption going, that is for the US economy to work, other
countries have to remit $180 billion every quarter, which is $2
billion a day, to the US!

A Chinese economist asked a neat question. Who has invested more, US in China, or China in US? The US has invested in China less than half of what China has invested in US.

The same is the case with India. It have invested in US over $50
billion. But the US has invested less than $20 billion in India.

Why the world is after US?

The secret lies in the American spending, that they hardly save. In fact they use their credit cards to spend their future income. That the US spends is what makes it attractive to export to the US. So US imports more than what it exports year after year.

The result:

The world is dependent on US consumption for its growth. By its deepening culture of consumption, the US has habituated the world to
feed on US consumption. But as the US needs money to finance its consumption, the world provides the money.

It's like a shopkeeper providing the money to a customer so that the customer keeps buying from the shop. If the customer will not buy, the shop won't have business, unless the shopkeeper funds him. The US is like the lucky customer. And the world is like the helpless shopkeeper
financier.

Who is America's biggest shopkeeper financier? Japan of course. Yet it's Japan which is regarded as weak. Modern economists complain that
Japanese do not spend, so they do not grow. To force the Japanese to spend, the Japanese government exerted itself, reduced the savings
rates, even charged the savers. Even then the Japanese did not spend (habits don't change, even with taxes, do they?). Their traditional postal savings alone is over $1.2 trillion. Thus, savings, far from being the strength of Japan, has become its pain.

Hence, what is the lesson?

That is, a nation cannot grow unless the people spend, not save. Not just spend, but borrow and spend.
Dr. Jagdish Bhagwati, the famous Indian-born economist in the US, told Manmohan Singh that Indians wastefully save. Ask them to spend, on imported cars and, seriously, even on cosmetics! This will put India on a growth curve. This is one of the reason for MNC's coming down to India, seeing the consumer spending.

'Saving is sin, and spending is virtue.'
But before you follow this Neo Economics, get some fools to save so that you can borrow from them and spend !!!

**2020: Double the Coal, Double the Asthma**

Tesla Motors of the United States just launched the Model 3 electric car that can run entirely on solar power, reducing any climate effects since it doesn’t need gasoline. Piyush Goyal of the Indian Power and Coal Ministry, on the other hand, just assured everyone that India will indeed [double] (http://profit.ndtv.com/news/commodities/article-india-to-rely-on-state-miners-to-meet-coal-target-piyush-goyal-1291421) its coal production by 2020, increasing every imaginable climate effect. So the government wants to increase coal production to 1.5 billion tonnes by 2020. State-owned Coal India ([COALINDIA](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ACOALINDIA&ei=vtABV7DnAtbajAGNr57QBQ)), India’s largest coal mining company, is already on track to increase its own production to 1 billion tonnes by 2020. The private sector was expected to pick up the tab for the remaining half a billion tonnes. But since the private sector companies are strapped for cash and can’t increase coal production to meet the target, the coal minister is pushing for other state-owned companies like NTPC ([NTPC](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ANTPC&ei=XtEBV7n2CoSA2AaLz7vwCA)), National Aluminium Co ([NATIONALUM](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ANATIONALUM&ei=ndEBV6GTBISe2AbWvIy4AQ)) to step up their coal production so the government can meet that target. “Renewables? Climate change? Pollution? Asthma? What do those words even mean?” - Piyush Goyal (paraphrased).

**No Smoking**

A group of cigarette manufacturing companies led by ITC Ltd. ([ITC](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AITC&ei=rNEBV-GJHMP02AbI5KiABQ)) through the Tobacco Institute of India have shut down all cigarette manufacturing facilities since [April 1st](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-itc-not-ready-to-print-bigger-health-warnings-on-cigarette-packs-factories-to-remain-shut-2197282). The stated reason for this is because of the ‘ambiguity’ over the size of pictorial health warnings on cigarette packages. Every cigarette packet is mandated by law to have horrible pictures of Satan’s lungs over them to discourage smoking. While a parliamentary committee had recommended the size of those pictures to be 50% of the packaging, the health ministry had ordered for the figure to be 85%. Not knowing which figure to follow, the cigarette manufacturers have decided to just shut down all operations and take daily losses of ₹350 crore. The theory behind the size of the pictures being - larger the picture, lesser the smoking. If you listen hard, you can almost hear the patron saint of anti-smoking ads, Mukesh turning in his grave thinking of what would’ve been if only the 85% sized pictures had come in his lifetime.

**Buybacks and Dividends to the Rescue!**

The Indian football team can’t set goals to win the FIFA World Cup 2018, unfortunately that’s just not realistic. And one of the basic rules of setting goals is that they should be realistically achievable. But somebody in the government never got that memo. After five consecutive years of failing to achieve targets of money raised through disinvestment, the government still set an all-time record [high](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/PAYP49n1pV885tWIPO7d3J/Disinvestment-scorecard-Govt-a-to-miss-target-16th-tim.html) target for this year. So it shouldn’t exactly be a surprise when it misses targets this year as well, which will be the 16th time in 25 years now. But unrealistic targets also lead to desperate actions to fulfill those targets. In this case, the government is looking at buybacks and special [dividends](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Govt-banks-on-unlisted-PSUs-to-mop-up-Rs-5k-cr-this-week/articleshow/51577307.cms) from unlisted state-owned companies like Hindustan Aeronautics and others. The extra cash in those companies will now be used to buy shares back from the government and declare special dividends amounting to almost ₹5,000 crore to help the government meet targets this year. Who wants to bet we’ll still miss targets this year and set an even higher target for next year?

**BJP’s Beef Ban Backfires**

(pause for reader to appreciate that alliteration) As a part of the BJP’s beef ban that was introduced in BJP-ruled states last year, it is prohibited to sell your cattle for slaughter. For people living in cities drinking Starbucks coffee, that’s hardly a problem since they don’t really own a lot of cattle. But for farmers living in villages drinking unfiltered water, that’s a huge [problem](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-beef-idINKCN0WU1UQ). If the rains don’t show up for a particular year, the crops fail and the farmer sells his cattle to feed his family. And when the rains do show up the next year, the crops blossom and the farmer buys the cattle back. But the beef ban just threw a wrench in this cycle by making it harder for people to sell their cows. Cattle prices have fallen across the country, by almost 40 to 60 percent in one district of Maharashtra and India’s meat exports have dropped 13%. This comes at a time when the government is trying very hard to appease farmers in a bid to win state elections later this year.

**For Sale: Tata Steel UK, Condition: Slightly Used**

On second thoughts, slightly used might not be the correct way of describing Tata Steel’s UK business. ‘Abused by the Chinese’ might be more accurate. Tata Steel ([TATASTEEL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ATATASTEEL&ei=3NEBV-H3IceJ2AbIrarYCw)) entered the UK Steel market by acquiring Corus, a company that was three times bigger than itself for $8.1 billion (₹53,654 crore) in 2007. Fast forward to two months ago, it declared a [loss](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/04/tata-steel-reports-third-quarter-loss-chinese-imports) of £68 million (₹641 crore) after suffering from cheap Chinese imports, high energy costs and weak demand. Last week, Tata Steel announced that it was putting up its entire UK business on the [auction](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/29/tata-set-to-announce-sale-of-uk-steel-business-port-talbot) block. The problem is: no one’s bidding. The UK government is even debating on just nationalizing the whole business to prevent mass layoffs and to protect what is an important part of the British economy. Of course, that’ll only be temporary nationalization until suitable buyers from the private sector can be found. Otherwise, it’ll be socialism (gasp).

**100% FDI in E-commerce *T&C Apply**

Millions of family-owned corner stores across India have moaned and complained since forever against e-commerce companies taking their customers away. And with Amazon gaining a foothold and Alibaba planning an Indian expansion, the e-commerce field in India is increasingly being dominated by foreign companies. The corner store guys were having none of this and filed a lawsuit saying this was illegal since foreign companies aren’t exactly allowed to set up retail operations in India. After years of uncertainty, we finally have a ruling on this - foreign companies are now legally allowed to set up e-commerce operations in India, but terms and conditions [apply](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ec51a45e-f5be-11e5-9afe-dd2472ea263d.html#axzz44oZbeUBy) (don’t they always?). These companies can’t sell directly to customers, but can only connect buyers and sellers. No single seller can account for more than 25% of sales. And these companies can not set prices themselves to offer discounts, as many do now to attract customers. Buy that smartphone for cheap while you can, the days of deep discounts may end before you know it.

I am stuck in a bad situation and I was hoping you could help me by guiding me on what to do or pointing to someone who could maybe guide me

**What I need help with** : Choosing a path to land a job as soon as possible

**What my problem is :** Was an entrepreneur for 3 years - I have only generalist skills, no employable skills. And I dont have money saved up. 

Some histroy -

I'm an Engineer with an MBA in Banking and Finance [Finished mba  2 years back from a top-12 college in India]. Right out of college I landed a job as a business analyst at a good IT firm [not Infosys/tcs etc] but I didn’t join that company and instead went into the family business.


Since  early 2014, I have been working for my 3 family businesses and done all sorts of general-ish stuff [One's a new school, another an industrial equipment manufacturing factory and the the third is a construction firm making residential apartments]


* in 2014, Worked towards planning, execution, purchase related stuff of construction of our school - involved dealing with suppliers, contractors etc


* In 2015, Worked in day to day planning, execution, management of our industrial manufacturing unit. Did lot of touring for this, to build better relationship with our clients and suppliers. I have experience of B2B marketing, building and maintaining client and supplier relationships etc]


* In 2016, in the construction firm, I oversaw and completed a small residential project and involved in a lot of aspects. Ive gone abroad in exhibitions and done B2C marketing, involved in sales and marketing department, designing/tweaking online ad campaigns, decision making for local sales channels like hoardings etc, supervision of day to day work on construction site etc. I believe I have a baisc working knowledge of the construction industry now.

However, now I am looking for a job since I haven’t earned anything in the past 3 years. **I cant take money from my family now due to a complicated situation. I am completely on my own** ,  There are no future earning prospects from the business for me, and my only way to survive is by taking up a job. Unfortunately, I don’t have any employable skills. I just don’t know what to do.


**I need a path to a job.** What is something I can do to land a job as quickly as possible. Can a person like me even get a job now ? I’m age 27 .


I was looking at 3 fields, but all involve a  lengthy studying time/skill acquisition time and less chance of getting a job – and time is something I don’t have : study finance to land a financial analyst job , study applied statistics to land a data analytics job – or somehow try to apply for business analyst job [by refreshing my domain knowledge from MBA]. I see a very very slim chance of me getting a job in these fields

Another thing I was thinking of was either take coaching for 10th standard Science/Maths or teach for MBA Entrance like CAT/GMAT etc. But how would I go about getting hired by a coaching center ?

Please help me.

**A Government of India Original**

The stage has been set - on one side, we have the world renowned economist, Raghuram Rajan and on the other side, we have the new MP on the block, Subramanian Swamy. It’s a battle of wits. It’s a battle of politics. But to find out if Rajan gets a second term at the RBI, or if Swamy successfully sends Rajan back to the US - watch out for season 2, coming this August. Apparently, the government is going to keep everyone [waiting](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-govt-to-take-call-on-raghuram-rajan-s-rbi-term-extension-in-august-2215544) till the 11th hour and only decide if Rajan gets a second term at the RBI in August, a month before his current term expires. Just when you thought you were getting into the show, they drop a huge cliffhanger and make you wait for the next season. Don’t you hate it when that happens? We already have the protagonist and the antagonist for this plot - might as well add in some supporting characters: Uday Kotak - promoter of the Kotak Mahindra Bank, and Adi Godrej - head of the Godrej group have endorsed Rajan for a second term. Even a poll of top CEOs from corporate India found overwhelming support for Rajan. So everyone wants a second term for Rajan. But that’s the thing with season premiers - they tend to take very unexpected plot twists.


**Another Round of Startup ~~Funding~~ Troubles**

Zimply, PepperTap, Stayzilla, TinyOwl, Swiggy… these words don’t sound like words at all. And until a few years ago, they were just a bunch of typos. But today, they are all venture-funded startups that recruit from some of the best talent pools in the country, the IIMs. Or at least they used to, until the startup boom turned into a balloon that’s constantly trying to run away from thorns. In the recent round of troubles, officials in charge of placements at IIMs are annoyed with startups deferring joining dates and marking down pay packages. To take the classic example of what happened with Flipkart, the company told all new recruits from IIM-A to sit back and relax for now and join the company in December instead of joining next month. And in exchange for the lost pay which can often run into several lakhs, Flipkart will bump up the signing bonus by a sweet ₹1.5 lakh. Now, the authorities at IIM-A are not happy with [these](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/iim-ahmedabad-asks-flipkart-to-address-placement-issue-2819413/) shenanigans at all, since a lot of students have loans they need to pay back. And have warned startups that there could be consequences. Moreover, what if the students take up writing in their free time till December? India cannot afford another Chetan Bhagat right now.

**A Change of Plans**

Last August, the RBI gave approvals to 11 companies to set up payments banks. The 11 companies are some of the who’s who of the business world - Reliance Industries, Aditya Birla, Vodafone, Airtel, IDFC Bank, Tech Mahindra and many more. And then there was also the Indian Department of Posts. But what in god’s name is a payments bank, I hear you ask. A payments bank is just a normal bank, except it can’t give out loans. And before you ask the next most obvious question, they make money from fees and commissions. But increasingly, the process of chasing after the RBI to obtain these approvals is starting to resemble dogs chasing after cars. They wouldn’t know what to do if they ever caught one. Now, three entities that received approvals including IDFC Bank and Tech Mahindra are [dropping](http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/tech-mahindra-drops-out-of-payments-bank-race-841548) plans to ever start a payments bank. The primary reason given for the change of plans is that competing with 11 other deep pocketed companies will result into wafer-thin profits which doesn’t make business sense. In short, simple capitalism at work. After all, chasing after things we don’t have, only to realize that we don’t want it when we do get our hands on it - is a timeless classic that is rooted deep inside all of us.

**Pakistan Is Listing Everything**

In 2013, Pakistan, our dear neighbour to the west, was about to Greece the place up by defaulting on its loans. You didn’t hear much about this because the IMF swooped in and saved the day by bailing Pakistan out to the tune of $6.7 billion. But IMF money rarely comes with no strings attached. As part of the bailout, Pakistan was required to privatize the economy by listing many of its state-owned companies on the stock exchange. Last week, the country [announced](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/world-news/pakistan-to-start-soft-marketing-state-airline-sale-in-june/263644/) that it is looking for investors as it plans to do exactly that and list over 68 companies including the Pakistan International Airlines, a bunch of steel mills and utility companies on the Pakistan Stock Exchange, which by the way is also being listed. So if you know a friend who’s got a few million lying around - hit them up, Pakistan’s looking for investors. Or we could make a kickstarter campaign. I can kick in 50 bucks. Either way, this is definitely not Pakistan’s week. Historically, India didn’t have access to Central Asia and Afghanistan since Pakistan blocked all the land routes. But with a newly [signed](http://qz.com/690217/india-just-played-a-masterstroke-in-iran-to-reinforce-its-regional-soft-power-status-in-asia/) contract with Iran, India can potentially bypass Pakistan and trade with Afghanistan and Central Asia through a sea route to Iran and a rail link from there on.

* If you’ve been reading this series regularly, you’ve likely realized two things by now - One, there is still faith for humanity and two, there is none for the banks. Canara Bank [reported](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/wWFiLKBr59fsto0fcqlbpO/Canara-Bank-posts-Rs-3905-crore-loss-in-Q4.html) a loss of ₹3,905 crore for January-March quarter. When the davids fall like dominos, the goliaths have to be limping, at the very least. The State Bank of India, the largest bank in the country, [limped](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/sbi-q4-fy-201516-results/article8654996.ece) along with a 66% fall in net profit to ₹1,263 crore. But the bad news at SBI wasn’t as bad as everyone expected, and so shares of SBI are up 17% despite a fall in profits. Yeah. That happens. Welcome to Dalal Street.

* For years now, kulcha warriors across the nation have been screaming that all things western are literally cancer. Well, they might not be entirely wrong. After demolishing Nestle by finding lead in Maggi, the powers that be have wished the end of Domino’s Pizza, McDonald’s and Subway as well. A study by the Center for Science and Environment [found](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-24/india-domino-s-mcdonald-s-operators-hurt-by-bread-cancer-report) that the bread used by these companies includes a cancer-causing substance. Shares of Jubilant Foodworks (Indian partner of Domino’s) and Westlife Development (franchisee of McDonald’s) were down on the news.

* As a net importer of oil, India has raked in millions as oil prices nosedived from a high of $100 to a low of $30. But every coin has two sides - and sadly, this isn’t that double-headed coin Jai used in Sholay. In real life, the good comes with the bad. Some 7 million Indians work abroad in the oil-rich Gulf countries that have fallen on bad times, and more and more are being forced to come home. Remittances from Indians working abroad [slumped](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-remittances-idINKCN0YG2OE) 27% to $48 billion - lowest since the 2008 crisis.

* The markets have a reputation for being sensitive. They tend to react even if Raghuram Rajan so much as sneezes. So events like the US Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate hike, or Britain’s referendum to leave the European Union, or China’s worsening economy are all but guaranteed to sway the markets one way or another. But forget all of that. After a 2-year drought, we have a monsoon on our doorsteps that has been forecast as above average - and experts [say](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/forget-fed-brace-up-for-monsoon-bonanza-on-d-street-el-nino-is-gone/articleshow/52430422.cms), this is the event that will define the economy over the next few months.

**Killing Tax Havens - One Treaty At A Time**

Question - What country ranks second in the share of foreign portfolio investments made in the Indian stock market? Answer - First of all, that is a very specific question to ask. And second of all, if you [answered](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-05-12/news/73039798_1_tax-treaty-capital-gains-tax-mauritius) Mauritius, give yourself a pat on the back. It’s not that ~~Martian~~ Mauritian citizens are crazy about Indian stocks, Mauritius is just an island that is even smaller than Mumbai and Delhi put together. It’s that investments made through Mauritius were exempt from Indian capital gains taxes - which essentially transformed Mauritius into a tax haven. It was all legal under a 30-year old treaty between the two countries that was signed in 1983. Ahh, the 1980s - when the Panama Papers wasn’t a thing, the accountants didn’t have to worry about ethics, and writing physical letters was actually cool and not just hipster cool. But all that and more is changing. Under an amendment to the treaty that was [agreed](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/u4AzTTKA5vCRJBWhANkuZN/Some-FAQs-on-the-Mauritius-tax-treaty.html) upon last week, India will begin imposing a capital gains tax on all future investments made through the country. This gives existing investors some wiggle room, and doesn’t trigger a crash in case existing investors decide to pull out.


**Raghu’s Second Term**

Time flies when you’re having fun, and it’s already time for another governor at the RBI. Current governor Raghuram Rajan’s term is about to end in September and there’s some awkward tension in the air about his reappointment since Rajan’s crusade against bad loans is expected to be done by March 2017, a full 6 months after his term expires. Chosen under former PM Manmohan Singh’s administration, Rajan [says](http://www.businessinsider.in/RBIs-Raghuram-Rajan-keeps-mum-about-second-term-but-reveals-his-backup-plan/articleshow/52185985.cms) he hasn’t been asked if he wants to continue as governor and intends to go back to teaching when he’s done. He can act as coy as he wants, but everyone knows that he wants to continue as governor. Who wouldn’t? It’s like asking an olympic gold winner if he’d like to continue winning the gold. However, the newest member of the Rajya Sabha, Subramanian Swamy, has [stated](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/send-raghuram-rajan-back-to-chicago-subramanian-swamys-new-attack-1405498) that Rajan is unsuitable to run the RBI and shouldn’t be reappointed. Swamy says that Rajan should instead pack up his bags and go to the US, where he is a professor at the University of Chicago. ‘Go back to (insert country here)’ seems to be a recurring theme lately.

**EPF Changes: Strike Three?**

At first they tried to tax your EPF withdrawals. But that didn’t work out. Then, they tried to restrict EPF withdrawals until you’re 58. But that didn’t work out either. Now, they are back. And this time, they want to help you buy a house. A new scheme currently under discussion would [allow](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/economy/epfo-members-to-benefit-as-govt-plans-low-cost-housing-scheme-for-over-5-cr-subscribers/251510/) you to pledge future EPF contributions as installments towards buying a house. Here’s how it would work: You go out and try to find your ultimate dream house. You give up and settle on one that your wife likes, because you just want to get this over with. Then you find a bank that doesn’t think you’re Mallya 2.0 and gives you a home loan. And now, your future EPF contributions can count as installments on the home loan. But you also have to be a low-income first-time home buyer to qualify. The last two times any modifications to the EPF system have been proposed, they have backfired. If this were baseball, the batter is already two strikes down and might end up with a strikeout, if this backfires as well.

**Numbers You Don’t Want To Hear**

The kryptonite of any agrarian economy is a prolonged drought. Like the one we’ve been having in over 10 states for the past two years now. A recent study [estimates](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/rs-650000-crore-thats-the-impact-the-drought-will-have-on-the-indian-economy-says-assocham/) the total impact of that drought on the national economy at ₹6,50,000 crore. That number is so huge, your brain is incapable of processing it. That’s because a loss of ₹100 is a tragedy, a loss of ₹100 crore is a statistic. Moving on to some much lighter news - the Indian banking [system](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/its-that-bad-if-you-pay-rs-150-for-a-bank-stock-rs-50-is-going-as-bad-loan/articleshow/52291846.cms) is on fire. If you spend ₹150 on buying stock in the average Indian bank right now - you’d be spending ₹50 just to purchase the bad loans that come with the bank. The skeletons could’ve stopped tumbling out at any point - but what’s the fun in that? New estimates show that the amount of bad loans in the Indian banking system might be greater than the entire economy of New Zealand. Little reminder - In statistics, you can either pick the data and write the story it supports, or you can pick the story and write the data that supports it.

* You know the usual startup story - work in a big MNC, then quit to join a startup to forge your own path and find success.

**No Money? No Problem**

No Problem for the banks that loaned you the money - big problems for you. The Lok Sabha just [passed](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-bankruptcy-idUSKCN0XS1NW) the landmark Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. Currently, we use a patchwork of laws that govern bankruptcies in India. That patchwork has resulted in 70,000 pending cases of bankruptcies. But the new bill sets a deadline of 180 days after the business defaults on loans during which the business owners and the lenders have to reach a resolution. Failing a resolution, the lenders can then sell the business to recover dues. This country is slowing moving to a market-based economy ever since the fall of the Soviet Union. And capitalism without bankruptcy is like christianity without hell. An interesting recommendation that could end up in the law seeks to ban bankrupt people from contesting in elections. Wonder if there was any specific person that inspired this recommendation. You know, a specific person who was a businessman and a politician but also went bankrupt while receiving excessive media coverage coinciding with a time when a lot of the banks are dealing with bad loans? (*cough cough* Vijay Mallya).

**A Democratic RBI**

Currently, the RBI functions like a dictatorship with the governor being the supreme leader. Basically, while sitting in his pajamas, Raghuram Rajan can make major changes that could either launch the economy into the future or turn the economy upside down. And nobody can do anything about it. But now the Finance Bill which just [passed](http://qz.com/676943/indias-bullet-proof-central-bank-is-about-to-get-another-layer-of-armour/) the Lok Sabha and is expected to pass the Rajya Sabha as well will turn the RBI into a quasi-democracy. The bill seeks to replace the current system with a six-member panel with three representatives from the government and three from the RBI. The panel will vote on the changes to be made and Rajan will be given the tie-breaker vote. No wonder Rajan is all for the new system because one, most major central banks do it this way, two, centralized power just hasn’t work out well historically and three, in case of terrible outcomes - just point to the panel for all the blame and in case of great outcomes - bask in the glory of all the history books and mainstream media credit as the governor of the RBI.

**Flopkart**

(That title was so obvious, it had to be used.) What’s the most important law of nature? No, it’s not ‘people who wear crocs don’t get laid’. It’s the law of gravity. What goes up must come down. Just a few years ago, Flipkart was the hot new thing on the startup scene. But now competition in the space is heating up. Starting just a few months ago, minority investors in Flipkart have begun to [slash](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/more-investors-mark-down-flipkart-valuation-116050400523_1.html) the value of their shares in Flipkart. In February, Morgan Stanley marked its investments in Flipkart down by 27%. Last month, T-Rowe Price marked its investments down by 15%. And now, Fidelity and Valic slashed the value of their investments by more than 20%. It’s not just Flipkart. HSBC [published](http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/09/zomato-demicorn/) a report that basically says Zomato is worth only half of what people say it’s worth. Is this what it felt like in 2000 just before the startup bubble popped? Zomato, which is thought to be a unicorn (a startup worth a billion dollars) might just be a demicorn (a startup worth half a billion - trademark pending). 

**The Singh Bros of Ranbaxy**

They say you should never hide information from your doctors and lawyers. Add one more to that list - a Japanese corporation that’s buying a majority stake in your business. The Singh brothers, ex-promoters of pharmaceutical company Ranbaxy Laboratories, are finding out just what happens when you cross that line. In 2008, the Singh bros sold a majority stake in Ranbaxy to the Japanese corporation, Daiichi-Sankyo (with an appropriately Japanese name too). But they allegedly, hid information from Daiichi that Ranbaxy was adulterating drugs that were made in India and sold in the US. They were caught in 2013, and Daiichi-owned Ranbaxy had to pay $500 million in damages. Since Daiichi had no idea that Ranbaxy was involved in these shady dealings when it bought a majority stake in 2008, it sued the Singh brothers for hiding that information. An arbitration panel last week found the Singh brothers guilty and [asked](http://www.wsj.com/articles/former-ranbaxy-owners-ordered-to-pay-385-million-to-daiichi-sankyo-1462473046) them to pay $385 million to Daiichi as damages. That’s got to be a bitter pill to swallow.

Business/Finance,RBI slashed the interest rate on credit card dues after I sent a petition to the Honorable Prime Minister,304,2vw8p6,vikkramm200,60,"Last year in May 2014, I had sent a letter about profiteering by Indian banks to the Prime Minister's Office, on the day when Mr Narendra Modi took charge. This letter mentioned several points about how banks were exploiting consumers. Some were even charging money for cash withdrawals and for counting currency. I also suggesting ways and means to make life easier for entrepreneurs and tax payers.

The entire letter can be found on my blog.

http://www.vikkrammchandirramani.com/india/18/letter-mr-narendra-modi-prime-minister-india-prevent-profiteering-indian-banks-and-make-lif

After over 35 years of credit cards being introduced in India, RBI has asked all banks to bring down interest rates. For all these years there has never been a cap on how much interest credit card companies could charge. Now, there will be. I'm amazed the way Modi ji and his government has acted to protect the interest of banking customers who have been exploited for decades by banks and credit card companies.

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Interest-on-card-dues-set-to-drop/articleshow/46225962.cms

This was covered by Business World magazine

http://www.businessworld.in/news/banking/how-to-stop-profiteering-by-banks-&-make-life-easier-for-taxpayers/1381616/page-0.html

The Prime Minister's office (PMO) sent me a reply a few weeks later, turning my letter into a petition. A few months later I received two replies from the Reserve Bank of India and one reply from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) addressing the capital market reforms I had suggested.

http://www.vikkrammchandirramani.com/india/22/sebi-sends-me-letter-responding-my-letter-honorable-prime-minister

One of the arguments that I put forth in my letter was about excessive interest rates being charged on credit card outstanding dues. To quote from my letter;

*The credit card division of banks needs to be looked at very seriously. Most banks that issue credit cards charge anywhere between 24% and 36% per annum as interest on the funds lent. Most people are not financially very savvy and this sends them into a debt trap. There is no justification for charging 36% on credit card advances when a loan to buy a scooter can be given at 15%.*

With this move, the RBI has implemented my suggestion. To quote the RBI report; *'Interest rates charged on credit card overdue were inordinately high and out of alignment with other products with similar risk profiles'.* The decision on trimming charges was taken at a conference attended by bank ombudsmen and the top rung of the RBI, which included governor Raghuram Rajan. The conference resulted in action points being drawn for the Indian Banks' Association. 

It is very heartening to see the agility with which the government has responded to my suggestions. This will, I hope, go a long way in giving a fair deal to banking consumers, increasing their purchasing power and improving the quality of life of the common man.

I also wrote a letter last month to the Honorable Finance Minister suggesting a Janta Credit Card, to eliminate black money from the economy. Please read it.

http://www.vikkrammchandirramani.com/india/23/my-letter-honorable-finance-minister-shri-arun-jaitley-suggesting-janta-credit-card-elimina

I'm hopeful that the PM and FM will consider implementing this solution. Apart from eliminating black money, it can go a long way towards ensuring inclusive growth, reducing the gap between the haves and have-nots, increasing India's competitiveness and ensuring employment and GDP growth.

**tl;dr: I sent a letter to the Honorable Prime Minister offering several suggestions to counter profiteering by banks, encourage entrepreneurship and reform taxation. One of the suggestions was to slash the interest rate on credit card dues. This was implemented yesterday, 35 years after credit cards were introduced in India.

Records like that are probably best left unbroken. Just as you breath a sign that after results like those, the worst is probably over - you realize it really isn’t. Both banks said that they expected the amount of bad loans to increase for a few quarters. Shareholders of bank stocks better get used to the pain of being burned by bad loans.

**Maruti Suzuki**: **:’(**

Delhi’s odd-even rule has drawn a lot of flak from residents who are being forced to take the bus every other day and smell the smells of the people on the bus. Among those unhappy has to be Maruti Suzuki, India’s biggest car maker. Maruti’s results for the first quarter of 2016 [reported](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/industry/companies/live-maruti-suzuki-q4-results-fy16-net-profit-sales-revenue-margins/243113/) a 12% decline in profits. Interestingly, the company cites the Jat reservation agitation as one of the reasons for a fall in profits. But there are also people who are happy with the odd-even rule. Like a 13-year old boy who registered the domain odd-even.com and [sold](http://www.scoopwhoop.com/Remember-The-13YearOld-Who-Created-The-OddEven-Website-Has-Now-Sold-It-To-Orahi/) it to carpooling app, Orahi and now attends advisory board meetings at Orahi as a technical expert, presumably right after watching Chota Bheem.

**Let’s Pretend Like This Is A Creative Title**

Every time there’s technological progress, people piss themselves silly telling everyone that machines will take all our jobs now. That has been happening since the past decade or so and likely started when they invented swords to replace the jobs of all the people who made pointy sticks. But today, there is a special kind of irony when the engineers who make machines and software that replace other people’s jobs start getting replaced by software and machines themselves. One of Infosys’ co-founders says growth in hiring has [decreased](http://www.businessinsider.in/Heres-why-automation-AI-is-good-news-for-IT-companies-and-bad-news-for-you/articleshow/52037635.cms) by 40% over the past 10 years and will likely fall further. And it’s all happening because of automation in the IT industry. There’s only one job available for every five engineers graduating every year. Psh, and they said arts students don’t get jobs. Due to this increased supply and reduced demand, salaries for new hires [stayed](http://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/corporate/no-salary-hike-for-freshers-in-it-space-amid-hiring-blues/52019188) pretty much the same despite a booming IT industry.

The Supreme Court [directed](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/sc-directs-vijay-mallya-to-furnish-details-of-assets-in-india-abroad/) Mallya to declare all his foreign and domestic assets to the banks so they can be better prepared at the negotiations table. Mallya isn’t back in the news. He just never left the news. They also just [revoked](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/25/india-revokes-passport-of-vijay-mallya-who-fled-to-london-owing-13bn) his passport - and being an MP, he’s even got one of those shiny red diplomatic passports, which is now useless. That last sentence was written before news broke that Mallya had [resigned](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vijay-mallya-resigns-from-rajya-sabha/article8547747.ece) from the Rajya Sabha -  so now that shiny red diplomatic passport is really useless.

**Bros Again: Reliance and Iran**

The Iranian Revolution of 1979 overthrew the ruling dynasty in Iran which was supported by the US. Since this was a matter of internal politics in a sovereign country outside the US territory, the US had to respond, as is tradition - and it promptly imposed economic sanctions, which were recently lifted. Reliance, which has substantial investments in the US, had suspended trade with Iran for fears of being dragged through the mud in the US. But last week, Reliance [resumed](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/reliance-buys-iranian-oil-after-6-year-hiatus_6377461.html) buying oil from Iran after almost 6 years. Talking about oil - oil prices have crashed the floor and everyone’s predicting the end of Saudi Arabia as we know it. There was even talk about an IPO for Saudi Aramco, the Saudi national oil company, to raise cash and douse the fire lit by falling oil prices. If there is a fire, the kingdom is trying to hide the smoke. Saudi Aramco is now actually looking to [expand](http://www.indiainfoline.com/article/news-top-story/saudi-aramco-mulling-offers-for-indian-oil-refinery-stakes-pradhan-116042600203_1.html) and buy stakes in Indian petrochemical projects, possibly in a planned oil refinery on the west coast.

* The presidential elections in the United States are proving to be the best drama series since Breaking Bad. And presidential candidates are all about that minimum wage. Even though the same conversation about minimum wage in India is painted less so with a political brush, last week we managed to [increase](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-contract-workers-may-soon-get-rs-10000-as-monthly-minimum-wage-2203056) the minimum wage for workers hired by contractors to ₹10,000 per month.

* Disclosing your salary to your coworkers can certainly make for some awkward water cooler conversation. But what if you are mandated by law to disclose your salary, not just to your coworkers but to the entire country? An RTI disclosure recently [revealed](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/banking-finance/article-raghuram-rajan-not-top-paid-executive-at-rbi-report-1398885) that RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, the guy that basically runs the Indian economy, is paid a gross salary of ₹1.98 lakh per month. Here’s the shocker - he’s not even the highest paid employee at RBI.

* Warren Buffett, everyone’s favourite billionaire (sorry Bill) recently livestreamed his company’s annual shareholder meeting on Yahoo. During the meeting, he showered praises upon praises on Amazon founder and fellow billionaire, Jeff Bezos. And Jeff deserves that pat on the back - As Amazon reported profits and revenues that crushed expectations back home in the United States, Amazon India [surpassed](http://www.bidnessetc.com/68048-amazon-shoves-snapdeal-aside-become-indias-2nd-largest-online-retailer/) Snapdeal to become the 2nd largest online marketplace in India after Flipkart.

* Two weeks ago, it was about Japan building India’s first bullet train. But then there’s China who wants to [build](http://techstory.in/india-high-speed-rail-network-19042016/) a second bullet train route in India, possibly a Delhi-Chennai connection. China does have the world’s largest bullet train network that it claims is profitable, but it also [has](http://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/india-on-5th-place-in-fake-goods-trade-china-on-top/story/232014.html) 63% market share in the global fake goods trade (India has 2%). Considering the state of Indian Railways, fake Chinese bullet trains will probably still be an upgrade.

Amazon is doing great. But Apple has seen better days. It reported a 22% fall in profits for the previous quarter. Its stock is down 15% for the month. It’s so bad that Apple CEO Tim Cook had to go on American TV to remind everyone that it’s still the most profitable company in the world. In India, things are equally grim. Market share of iPhones [dropped](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Samsung-outpaces-Apple-to-emerge-as-leader-in-Indias-premium-smartphone-segment/articleshow/52035720.cms) from 55% a year ago to just 37% today. And Samsung emerged as the leader with a 62% market share. Where are all the apple fanboys now, huh?

In a lot of the developed world, people always call out the top 1%, the richest individuals, to stop evading taxes and pay their fair share. But in India, if you do pay taxes, you are actually the 1%.

###Headline Stories
***

**WANTED: RBI Governor**

Alright, you knew this was coming. You don’t live under a rock. You’ve heard about this. We have had wall to wall coverage of this story since it broke. And as the most important economic story of the week, it has to be talked about here. RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan does not [want](http://in.reuters.com/article/rbi-chief-rajan-quit-idINKCN0Z50N2) a second term. In a message to the RBI staff that was released on the central bank’s website, Rajan has stated his desire to not continue as the governor. Instead, he’s going back to his old teaching job in the US. Apparently, the governor was very much interested in serving a second term. But getting reappointed would mean that he would have to maneuver the delicate political minefield. And Rajan was unwilling to get down and dirty in the intricate interlockings of Indian politics, which has now become more complex than the plot of Game of Thrones. And so, the House of Rajan will now be leaving the show in September. This decision to not continue marks a political victory for the campaign against his reappointment, which was led by Subramanium from the House of Swamy. 


**Flying Higher**

Rule 4/20 is the rule that states you must smoke a little something when the clock strikes 4:20. Rule 5/20 is not as exciting or fun, and only applies to the Indian aviation industry. The 5/20 rule states that any Indian airliner must have 5 years of experience flying domestic routes and must own 20 aircrafts before it can operate any international routes. It might sound like redundant regulation to you, but that’s not how the folks at Jet Airways and SpiceJet see this. To incumbent airliners who already satisfy the rule, this is hugely beneficial since it removes competition on international routes. But to newer airliners like Air Asia who don’t satisfy the rule, this is a lost business opportunity. But a new civil aviation policy approved last week [removed](http://in.reuters.com/article/india-airlines-rules-idINKCN0Z110J) the 5-year experience requirement, however the 20 aircraft rule still stands, making it the 0/20 rule. A big round of FDI reforms has also eased rules for FDI in the aviation industry.

**EU & Britain - The Big Divorce**

Britain, the real reason why Indians love tea and cricket, is going through a messy divorce. In a nation-wide referendum, Britishers will soon vote if they want the country to leave the European Union or stay in the European Union. A popular argument for staying in the EU cites the disastrous effects that the British economy is expected to experience if it leaves. The UK Treasury [says](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/macro-view/talking-point-brexit-and-indian-markets/article8748796.ece) that if Britain leaves, inflation will spike, unemployment will rise, and GDP growth might be 6% lower. But let’s be honest, most of you can’t be bothered to keep up with even the Indian economy. The news is boring, uninteresting, mundane and all the other synonyms of boring. And here is a story asking you to care about the British economy. So before you tune out, know that you should care about this because the global economy is a series of dominos, and one of them might fall next week. Most of the world is urging Britain to stay in the EU. But really, the only evidence that anyone needs to take into consideration is - Donald Trump supports Britain leaving the EU. And that right there, should be enough information for the British people to know which way to vote.

**STILL WANTED: RBI Governor**

You know what? We haven’t talked about this enough. This story deserves another look. The big news of Rajan’s departure was dropped in an open letter that Rajan wrote to the RBI staff. And it caught everyone off-guard, including the government. While Rajan gets ready for his exit interview, the government is busy looking at résumés of candidates to fill his position. The news of his departure isn’t even a week old, but the race to replace him is already starting to heat up. The shortlist has as many as [seven](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/seven-names-on-long-list-to-replace-rbis-rajan-official-1420762) people, but the frontrunner right now is Arundhati Bhattacharya, a high-profile banker who has been at the helm of India's largest lender - State Bank of India. If you think you can make the shortlist, send your CV to: Sansad Marg, Janpath, New Delhi, Delhi 110001. Either way, get ready to bid farewell to Rajan. It sure was good while it lasted, wasn’t it? But like all good things in life, it had to come to an end. Rajan, we had a lot of fun together, didn’t we? Remember when you cut consumer inflation from a high of 11.16% to a low of 3.69%? Yeah.. Good times. And remember when you increased the foreign exchange reserves from $275 billion to $363 billion? Yeah... Those were the days. I’m sorry, I think I need some time alone.

* To stop cheap imports of foreign wheat from messing with the domestic wheat market which employs a lot of farmers, the government levies a duty of 25% on all wheat imports. Last week, the duty which was set to expire this month was [renewed](http://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/in-other-news/180616/india-extends-25-percent-tax-on-wheat-imports-ram-vilas-paswan.html) for 3 more months. But it might not work as planned. Despite being the world’s 2nd largest producer of wheat, Indian imports of wheat could touch a decade-high this year. Well, at least the government will make a ton of cash off it.

* Technically, Amazon India is not an e-commerce company. It is an online marketplace [that](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/amazon-continues-to-lobby-for-hybrid-ecommerce-model-in-india-116061300365_1.html) connects buyers and sellers. E-commerce is when you sell inventory directly to the buyer. Current regulations don’t allow FDI in e-commerce, which means foreign companies like Amazon can’t enter the e-commerce industry. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos recently met PM Modi and lobbied him to allow FDI in e-commerce. One can only imagine how frustrated Bezos must’ve felt when they told him that last week, India [eased](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/govt-to-hold-briefing-on-fdi-rules-today/article8751887.ece) FDI rules for 9 industries including aviation, defense, pharma and food processing. Can you guess which industry didn’t make the cut?

* Larsen & Toubro has [bagged](http://in.reuters.com/article/soccer-worldcup-qatar-idINKCN0YS0P2) a $135 million contract to build a stadium in Qatar for the FIFA 2022 World Cup. $135 million is a lot of money. Qatar’s economy is largely based on oil and prices are not exactly ideal right now. So if you’re wondering how they are even paying for the stadium, wonder no more - The Gulf country has cut planned spending on building hospitals by about two-thirds in 2016 following the drop in oil prices to keep expenditure on its World Cup-related projects unchanged. Those are some solid priorities right there.

* It hasn’t even been a week since the news of Rajan’s departure broke and bad news has already [started](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/wpi-inflation-rises-to-079-in-may-on-higher-food-prices/article8727957.ece) rolling in. Consumer inflation, which halved during Rajan’s tenure, came in at a 21-month high of 5.76% for the month of May. Food prices for the month went up by 7.55%, also a 21-month high. Wholesale inflation, which was negative until two months ago, came in at a 19-month high of 0.76%. RAJAN. THERE IS STILL TIME. PLEASE DON’T LEAVE ME.

They say there aren’t any free lunches in the world. But at least you don’t get the bill after a free lunch. However, that might soon change. Due to some ambiguity in the GST bill as it stands right now, you could [potentially](http://www.businessinsider.in/Nothing-is-going-to-come-for-free-after-GST-is-implemented-Heres-why/articleshow/52775662.cms) end up paying taxes on things that you get for free. While it is highly unlikely that this goes through, this could spell the end of all those ‘Buy One, Get One Free’ offers that businesses use to kill two birds with one stone - get some solid goodwill with consumers, and get rid of old merchandise.

For a lot of Indians, the festival that brings families and friends together is no longer Diwali. It’s the festival of IPL. The sporting franchise recently concluded its 9th season this year. And it [raked](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/media/ipl-is-a-money-spinner-as-it-amasses-rs-2500-crore-in-its-ninth-season/articleshow/52720049.cms) in ₹2,500 crore in overall revenue from advertising, sponsorships, ticket sales and merchandising. A big chunk of that money, as much as ₹1,100 crore went to Sony as the official broadcaster of the IPL. With that kind of cash, it doesn’t matter which team you support or which team wins, the executives at Sony always win.

###Headline Stories

**Return Of The Avengers**

Whoever says Hollywood’s superhero movies are unrealistic? The Avengers are actually real. Hollywood’s Avengers was a group of superheroes saving the universe by blowing stuff up. In reality, the Avengers are a group of guys that just blow stuff up for no real reason. The Niger Delta Avengers militant group has been [blowing](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/07/oil-hovers-near-8-month-highs-on-us-inventory-draw.html) up oil wells in Nigeria and has rejected any peace talks with the government. After dropping to dangerous lows of $20, crude oil prices have bounced back and recently crossed the $50 mark. Much of the reason for this rise is simply the forces of supply and demand reacting to each other in a free market. But one of the reasons it touched $50 last week was the Avengers sabotaging oil wells. A lot of investors betting on the resurgence of oil can’t say this out loud, but thank god for terrorist Avengers. However, not everybody is celebrating the return of oil. In the latest policy review, the RBI (which kept interest rates untouched last week), [cited](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/commodities/news/black-gold-a-headache-not-only-for-modi-but-for-raghuram-rajan-too/articleshow/52634156.cms) rising oil prices as a risk. Because when oil prices go up, inflation goes up as well. Personally, I’m just sad that budget cuts forced the Avengers to opt for simple dynamite instead of nuclear-powered Mach-5 flying suits.

**Black Problems**

India has a huge second economy that deals with black money. That’s news to nobody. But a new study has [pegged](http://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/new-study-pegs-black-money-in-india-at-rs-30-lakh-crore/story/233395.html) the size of that black economy at an astounding 20% of GDP or over ₹30 lakh crore (that’s 3 followed by 13 zeroes). And that just happens to be bigger than the overall economic size of countries like Thailand or Argentina. While the size of India’s black economy expanded rapidly during the 70s and 80s, it has been gradually declining since then. Today, most of this money is locked up in physical assets like real estate or gold. Due to obvious reasons, there are no official figures but experts say that as much as 30% of India’s real estate sector is funded by black money. Really, only in economics can you root for the supremacy of white over black and not be called a ~~Donald Trump supporter~~ racist.

**The Curious Case Of Missing GDP**

How does a 7.9% growth in GDP sound to you? If you ask the average joe on the streets, he won’t know what is what. But if you ask the fairly well-read joe on the streets, he’ll tell you that a 7.9% growth rate is amazing. But what about a 3.9% growth in GDP? Now, that’s bad. Official numbers released last week say that India’s GDP in the March quarter grew by 7.9%. But wait, there’s more. The accuracy of those numbers has been [called](http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/kvvDHfbryOQjvu2l16UcEI/Discrepancies-drive-GDP-growth.html) into question. When you break GDP down into its components, sometimes the data doesn’t add up. It’s life. Sometimes, things just don’t add up. So this gap is then plugged by calling the missing portion as a ‘discrepancy’. As long as this discrepancy doesn’t get too big, all is well. But the amount of discrepancy in the latest numbers has shot up by over 350%. And if you remove the amount put under ‘discrepancy’, GDP growth rate falls from 7.9% to 3.9%. Faking GDP numbers? Come on guys, that’s not our job. That’s China’s [job](http://fortune.com/2015/12/14/china-fake-economic-data/).


**Economic Story Because Export and Import**

Nuclear weapons are serious business. Emphasis on serious rather than business. Although a handful of companies do make money off the nuclear power business. When sensitive nuclear technology falls in the wrong hands, you have rogue nations like North Korea and when it falls in the right hands... well, there really aren’t any right hands for nuclear weapons. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) is a group of 48-countries that controls the export and import of goods that can be used to make a nuclear weapon. The NSG does this to ensure that nuclear technology doesn’t fall in the wrong hands. But India is not one of its 48 members. One of the reasons we are not invited to parties thrown by the NSG is because we have nuclear weapons but haven’t signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which is an international agreement designed to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. This is a sore point with a lot of countries like China who are against India joining the NSG. However, being being friends with the United States, the world’s superpower does come with a lot of benefits. A US-led push to include India in the NSG is [picking](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-nuclear-idUSKCN0YV13Z) up steam as nations like South Africa and Turkey are coming around to supporting India’s bid for a membership. Here’s the irony - the only reason the NSG even exists as an international group, is because India tested nuclear weapons in the 70s and that rustled some jimmies in the international community.

* Government offices spend around 10-20% of non-plan expenditure or roughly 1.4 lakh crore on routine office purchases like cups and saucers to laptops and printers. And the government’s purchasing arm is [considering](http://www.businessinsider.in/Government-e-Marketplace/articleshow/52652285.cms) a portal called GeM (Government e-Marketplace) that’ll let employees buy routine office purchases online. Basically, they’re making a clone of Flipkart. Because you know, using Flipkart is just too mainstream now.

* The Tata Group of companies is a big group of companies. They’ve got companies tucked away in every nook and cranny of the economy - a total of close to 100 companies, of which only 30 companies are listed on the stock exchange. That number is set to become 31, as the group [revived](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/ipos/fpos/tata-technologies-revives-ipo-plan-likely-to-raise-rs-1400-crore/articleshow/52664433.cms) plans of an IPO for Tata Technologies, the engineering and IT arm of Tata Motors. If this goes through, it’ll also be the first IPO from the Tata Group in 12 years after TCS in 2004.

* The US-India Business Council counts the big boys of the global industry like Boeing, PepsiCo, MasterCard and many more as its members. And collectively, these big boys are [investing](http://www.firstpost.com/world/modi-terms-india-new-engine-of-growth-usibc-sees-45-bn-investment-2822448.html) a total of $45 billion on expanding operations in India. It’s not just one big cheque, they’ll invest over a few years. Amazon, a member of the Council as well as a big boy, committed to investing an extra $3 billion in addition to $2 billion already invested in Amazon India. The $5 billion funding will take Amazon India past the combined funding raised by both local rivals, Flipkart and Snapdeal. 

* A hot, young investment banker in London just bought a new Jaguar Land Rover car nicknamed the ‘baby Jag’ in all cash upfront. A trucker in Uttar Pradesh just scraped together enough money to buy a light Tata truck hoping that ferrying cargo from city to city will pay for his son’s education. What do those two people have in common? They both [contributed](http://www.outlookindia.com/newswire/story/domestic-turnaround-jlr-boost-tata-motors-net-profit-three-fold/941818) to the tripling of profit for the March quarter at Tata Motors to ₹5,177 crore.

###Footnote Stories

Earlier this year, the Indian government once again tried to get the famed Kohinoor diamond back from the UK and failed. Citing that it would set an “unworkable precedent”, UK Prime Minister David Cameron [refused](http://www.newsweek.com/kohinoor-diamond-india-colonialism-449951) to return the stone, which has been claimed by the governments of Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan at various points as well. That didn’t pan out quite well. But how do 200 statues and sculptures sound instead of 1 big fat diamond? The US  is [returning](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/07/us/stolen-artifacts-returned-india/) more than 200 artifacts that were stolen and smuggled out and eventually just ended up in the hands of the US government. Some of them are as old as 2,000 years and are worth over $100 million.

The government has, for the first time in history, [declared](http://www.thequint.com/india/2016/06/03/india-will-have-surplus-power-for-the-first-time-ever-report) that it will not have a shortage of electricity this year. Baring the small matter of authorities often choosing to black out certain areas to hide demand, from June onwards, the country will have more electricity than required. Psh. Power cut. Shmower Cut.

**The Rain Gods Want Beer And IPL**

Maharashtra is suffering from a major drought, which is a big deal because hospitals in the severely hit areas have had to cancel operations due to water shortages. It’s so bad that SS* President Uddhav Thackeray has [asked](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/maharashtra-drought-water-crisis-latur-govt-should-stop-water-supply-to-beer-units-in-view-of-drought-shiv-sena-chief-2756485/) the government to stop supplying water to breweries in the state. There’s more. The Mumbai High Court has also [ordered](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-36038026) 13 IPL Cricket matches to move out of the state (cricket matches use up a ton of water). You know it’s bad when they go after cricket and beer. The rain gods got a wind of what was happening and have decided to stop the madness before riots break out. The Indian Meteorological Department, which predicts rainfalls among other things, has [predicted](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Economy-set-for-boost-as-Met-forecasts-above-normal-monsoon/articleshow/51802516.cms) “above normal” rainfall this year that may break the two-year long drought and help revive a weak farm economy. Take it with a grain of salt since these are only predictions but they have been supported by two private forecasters as well.

*Shiv Sena, not the Nazis.

**Some Good Numbers**

Several agencies just unloaded a big data dump and while the data isn’t always good, this time it is. Consumer Price Inflation [slowed](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/retail-price-inflation-slows/article8467622.ece) to 4.83% in March, the lowest it has been in 6 months. The price declines were led by the ‘food and beverage’ segment. Who doesn’t love cheap food? Industrial Output broke a 3-month negative streak to grow by 2% in February while electricity production grew by 10% in the same month. All those foreign tours are paying off - despite a decrease from 2014 numbers, recent numbers show India as the world’s largest remittance recipient in 2015 after NRIs [sent](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/India-is-top-remittance-recipient-of-2015-World-Bank/articleshow/51822766.cms) back $69 billion (₹459,988 crore) to families in India. Economists around the country are calling it the “Karan Johar effect”. But that also works the other way around - outward remittances from India grew by over 300% to reach $499 million (₹3,326 crore). Although bank deposits grew by 10%, it’s the slowest growth rate since 1963. But that could also indicate increased consumer spending which can be good for the economy - depends on if you’re a glass half-full or half-empty kind of person.

**No Smoking - Part 2**

Part 1 Recap: The size of the pictorial health warnings that go over cigarette packets was increased from 20% to 85%. Confusion over the decision prompted cigarette manufacturers including ITC ([ITC](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3AITC)) to shut down all cigarette factories in protest. And now…

Part 2: Turns out - all that drama was over nothing. Cigarette manufacturers, having realized that the government can stay adamant longer than they can stay in business, have decided to [resume](http://www.businesstoday.in/current/corporate/itc-to-resume-cigarette-manufacturing/story/231126.html) cigarette manufacturing. But that doesn’t mean the end of this saga. While the mainstream cigarette brands have resumed production, now the traditional cigarette makers that make *beedis*, have [shut](http://in.reuters.com/article/tobacco-industry-supreme-court-appeal-idINKCN0XB1H6) down production because the “wrapping paper edges prevent printing on a reasonably large area of the curved surface”. The beedi industry employs more than 8.8 million Indians mostly in rural impoverished areas, who might be temporarily out of a job. A lawsuit challenging the size increase has already made its way to the Supreme Court which is set to hear the case on April 22nd.

Stay tuned for Part 3 - Coming Soon.

**TCS’s US Troubles**

A grand jury in the United States has [held](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/tcs-denies-ip-infringement-will-appeal-940-million-jury-award-in-us-trade-secrets-theft-case/articleshow/51855594.cms) Tata Consultancy Services ([TCS](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ATCS)) in violation of copyright and intellectual property laws and asked the company to pay a fine of $940 million (₹6,266 crore). In October 2014, Epic Systems, an American healthcare software provider, filed a lawsuit accusing TCS of stealing trade secrets, confidential information and more than 6,000 secret documents in order to improve its own competing product called ‘Med Mantra’. And now, the jury has found that TCS did indeed do all those things. TCS, part of the Tata Group known for its integrity and ethics, has denied all allegations. Cheap ripoffs of Western products and brands is usually China’s ball game. But hey, if it works, why not? Except this time, it turned out to be not so cheap - $940 million is close to half of Epic Systems annual revenue.

**Greybull Capital To The Rescue!**

Tata Steel ([TATASTEEL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE%3ATATASTEEL)), after a year of intensive searching has found a scapegoat that’s willing to buy a part of its loss-making UK operations. The company is [selling](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/industry/companies/tatas-sell-uk-unit-to-greybull-for-1/235275/) a part of its failing business in the UK to private equity investor Greybull Capital (not to be confused with Red Bull, provider of wings). You don’t really understand the extent to which the Tatas were desperate until you hear that the UK business was sold for just a nominal sum of £1 (94 rupees) and the current pension obligations for employees will still stay with the Tatas. The search for buyers for the remaining parts of the business is still on. However, this has not scared the company off Europe in any way. Tata Steel was [reported](http://in.reuters.com/article/tata-steel-thyssenkrupp-idINKCN0XA0F0) to be in talks with Germany’s Thyssenkrupp (thi-sen-krup) to merge their European businesses under a joint venture.

**Banks - Mo’ Money, No Problems**

Two major private sector banks, Axis and HDFC, reported results for the quarter ending June and it’s a mixed bag. The bad loans crisis [continued](http://www.financialexpress.com/industry/banking-finance/axis-bank-q1-results-net-profit-bad-loans-on-july-22-2016/325755/) to hit Axis Bank where profits fell by 21%. But HDFC Bank, which mostly focuses on retail borrowers, [managed](http://in.reuters.com/article/hdfc-bank-results-idINKCN1010ML) to entirely miss the crisis as profits were up by 20%. However, the bag isn’t so mixed when it comes to public sector banks which are riddled with problems. The government’s got 99 problems, and 98 of them probably involve the banking sector in one way or another. Now, one way to solve problems is to just throw money at the problem. And 13 public sector banks just [received](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/govt-allocates-rs-22915-cr-for-psu-bank-re-capitalization_7065221.html) about ₹22,915 crore of cash from the government. A back of the envelope calculation says if they had delivered all that cash physically, it would weigh about 275 kgs. Yes, I did the math. After reserving a lot of money to treat the bad loans problem, the banks didn’t have much remaining to lend out to borrowers. And if banks stop lending money, the entire economy grinds to a halt. So the new capital given by the government is supposed to help them get back into the lending game again. The largest recipient of this capital infusion was our largest bank, the State Bank of India that got about ₹7,575 crore. However, this is only a “capital infusion” and definitely not a “bailout”. Who even said bailout? There’s no bailout here. What bailout?

**ELI5 - GST**

GST - You know it’s a thing. But you don’t have a single clue what it’s about. The only time you hear about it is while changing channels on the TV. And from your drunk uncle at wedding receptions who thinks he’s an expert in politics. The Goods and Services Tax is probably the most important tax reform of this decade. It replaces a whole bunch of indirect taxes such as the VAT, Service Tax or Excise Duty. So instead of paying ten taxes at ten places, you only pay one tax at one place. And cutting down on that paperwork starts a domino effect of good things for the economy. At least that’s the theory. But the bill has been stuck in Rajya Sabha for a long time now. So what’s the big hold up? Political parties have been negotiating the finer details of the bill and the negotiations are taking a little more time than everybody expected. Some sore points of disagreement are whether to place a maximum limit of 18% above which the GST tax rate cannot be raised, whether to levy a 1% surcharge on interstate trade and how to resolve any disputes in the process. But now, if you feel like you aren’t getting enough of our beloved parliamentarians that are so hard at work solving our problems in penthouses all around Delhi, then fear no more. Because the government is [planning](http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/gst-hopes-brighten-as-congress-signals-support-bjp-ready-for-debate-in-rajya-sabha_1908866.html) a 5-hour-long debate in the Rajya Sabha aiming to resolve all disputes and pass the bill once and for all. That’s right, back to back five hours of bickering old men in white clothes - without any commercial breaks.

**Tesla to go desi?**

The pollution in Delhi has reached such an alarming level that if a Delhi resident starts smoking 10 packs of cigarettes a day and garnishing his food with powered nicotine while sleeping in a chamber full of passive tobacco smoke, he’ll probably still die of asthma from the polluted air before the lung cancer gets to him. And then there’s Delhi CM Mr. Kejriwal who recently hinted at the possibility of the torturous odd-even rule returning back to Delhi during the upcoming winters to curb pollution. What the city clearly needs is a whole bunch of emission-free electric cars. And accordingly, the government’s making moves to get Tesla, the car company famous for its electric cars to come to India. Apart from offering to promote joint ventures between Tesla and Indian car companies, the government is even [offering](http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/tesla-and-make-in-india-a-roadway-to-cleaner-and-greener-india-but-how-soon-326205.html) Tesla land near major ports so it can Make in India and export to other Asian countries as well. However, the pipe dream of driving a Tesla down the national highways is unlikely to come true for at least a few years. Until then, we’ve got to find other ways to reduce pollution. Such as banning all diesel vehicles older than 10 years, which is what the National Green Tribunal just did. NGT, a top environmental court, has [directed](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-autos-court-idUSKCN0ZY12P) Delhi transport authorities to de-register any diesel vehicles older than 10 years, and car companies couldn’t be happier.

~~**Tollywoodonomics**~~  **Kollywoodonomics**

Rajinikanth, the Amitabh Bachchan of the South, was out with his latest movie *Kabali*, which opened last Friday in 6,500 theaters, many of which were sold out for the entire weekend. In the movie industry, you’re only as good as your last flop - and in Rajini’s case, his last movie was *Lingaa* and before that, *Kochadaiiyaan* - both of which - well, let's just say that they haven’t exactly been Spielberg material. So you’d think producers would think twice before betting on this next film - but this Rajini we are talking about. He doesn’t follow the laws of economics. The laws of economics follow Ra... okay, yeah, those jokes stopped being funny 10 years ago. But still, people literally pour milk on huge cutouts of this guy. So producers went all in and funded Kabali with a budget of ₹110 crore. Here’s the kicker - the movie had already [earned](http://www.firstpost.com/bollywood/how-rajinikanths-kabali-has-earned-rs-200-crore-days-before-its-release-2902140.html) ₹200 crore even before being released. Music rights, overseas rights, satellite rights and all other kinds of rights had already earned the movie a ton of cash before being released. How much did Rajini make off the movie? The actor was reportedly [paid](http://www.catchnews.com/regional-cinema/revealed-this-is-how-much-rajinikanth-charged-for-kabali-movie-news-rajinikanth-kabali-fees-revealed-1469024603.html) ₹35 crore as acting fees plus he’s set to receive another ₹45 crore from first week collections of the movie at the box office. Rajini being Rajini, theaters were sold out but prices for tickets in black ranged up to ₹1,500 with reports saying fans were ready to pay as much as ₹5,000 for tickets. All of this only points to one thing - at 65-years old, Rajini’s still got some swag.

* The latest version of Fortune magazine’s famous list of 500 top companies in the world was published last week. While the list features companies that are the crème de la crème of the world’s companies, much like the Olympic medal rankings, it is dominated by western multinationals with a few Indian companies here and there. Specifically, seven Indian companies. But the three top [ranked](https://www.scoopwhoop.com/These-Are-The-Seven-Indian-Which-Companies-Which-Made-It-To-Fortune-500-List/) are - Indian Oil (161st), Reliance (215th) and Tata Motors (226th). 

* Every e-commerce company in India needs a payment processor/digital wallet to make transactions go smoothly. For this exact purpose, Amazon acquired Emvantage, Snapdeal owns Freecharge and Paytm is a digital payment franchise in itself. So, of course Flipkart would want it’s own toy to play with. After acquiring PhonePe (a payments startup) this April, Flipkart is [investing](http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2016/07/21/why-flipkart-is-building-a-670-crore-digital-payments-business/) an additional ₹670 crore in the company which is expected to start processing digital payments on Flipkart, Myntra and its logistics service, eKart in the next few weeks.

However, mobile internet packs have stood the test of drought to become best-sellers across rural India. Which, I believe, can be taken as conclusive evidence that even farmers in far-reaching corners of rural India love browsing aww-worthy cat photos on the internet. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola, the hardest hit company, is wiping its tears of sadness with the $1.4 billion it earned in profits just last quarter.

High inflation is one of the worst things that can happen to the Indian middle class. As in the type of middle class that earns way less than ₹1.6 lakhs per month. There’s food inflation, price inflation, fuel inflation, netflix is raising prices.. And now, there’s pocket money inflation. A 29-city survey of nearly 7,000 kids aged between 4 to 14 and their parents [reveals](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/spend/kids-pocket-money-up-100-since-2012-turner-international-india-study/articleshow/53238075.cms) that the average pocket money given to kids has shot up by 100% since 2012, and currently stands at ₹555 per month.  

If the Gods know everything in the universe, supposedly they would also know about things like earnings per share or book value vs. market value, which would make them great investors.

The temple receives about ₹75 crore of donations in cash and kind annually, which is entirely tax-free. Now, Lord Shiva isn’t just the destroyer of the worlds, he might even be a shareholder of Infosys.

**Last Week On Rajan Watch**

Last year, PM Modi called RBI Governor Rajan as the “best teacher” for explaining complex economic issues to him. Days later, Rajan said the teaching went both ways. Aww. But the bromance doesn’t end there. Reports saying the PM is “proud” of Rajan surfaced last week [stating](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-rajan-insight-idUSKCN0YM2SC) that any campaign against Rajan will not affect the big decision that he needs to make on Rajan’s reappointment. That might’ve been a snide reference to MP Subramanian Swamy’s moves to remove Rajan, Swamy has even rebuked Rajan for “speaking like a grandfather” (what? with artificial teeth? I mean Rajan is already 53, while Swamy is 76). Being best buds with Modi will definitely help Rajan secure his governorship at the RBI for a second term. But then, later in the day, reports [surfaced](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbi-governor-raghuram-rajan-doesnt-want-extension-media-report/articleshow/52536142.cms) that Rajan doesn’t even want to continue as Governor and would rather be a spectator in the game by going back to teach in the US and continue research on the Indian economy. Apparently, his family has already left. Somebody better buy the rights to this reality show - I’m personally hanging by the edge of my seat. Rajan is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the interest rate meeting this week. And the markets are expected to worry more about the “Rexit” - Rajan exiting the RBI than the interest rates this week. 

**Lincoln Could Only Do So Much**

When you have North Korea, Uzbekistan, Cambodia and Qatar at the top of a list - you pretty much know that the it isn’t the list of world’s happiest countries, it just has to be a list about something bad. Last week, India [shared](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/with-18-35-million-people-india-tops-global-slavery-index-1413891) a spot on such a list with all of these countries and it was the list that ranks countries in terms of slavery. Yikes. Owning a person might’ve gone out of fashion decades ago, but the trend is still alive - With a global figure of 46 million modern-day slaves, India is home to 18 million of those modern-day slaves followed by 3 million in China and 2 million in Pakistan that are implicated in domestic work, prostitution, manual labour, forced begging and so on. Even in manufacturing, working conditions at factories contribute a lot to the problem by essentially turning employees into slaves. Prominent for workplace [violations](http://www.thequint.com/india/2016/06/01/gap-walmart-factory-workers-exploited-and-abused-in-india) are factories that supply global multinationals like Walmart or Gap. They’ve been known to have working conditions that don’t just border on exploitation - but are miles away from that border, deep into exploitation territory. Complaints include non-payment of wages, forced overtime work, inability to form unions, extreme health consequences that may be fatal due to lack of safety regulations and even sexual harassment. How’s that 9-to-5 desk job sounding now?


**Follow The Money?**

In 2014, between the time when Modi was elected and the time when Modi was sworn-in as the PM, the Sensex was [up](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/narendra-modi-vs-bse-sensex/) 1,685 points. Clearly, the stock market loves Modi. But Modi thinks of the stock market as just a friend. Asset disclosures have [revealed](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/pm-modi-top-ministers-stay-clear-of-stocks-keep-assets-in-realty-banks/articleshow/52413153.cms) that the PM has 79% of his total assets, which amount to a total of ₹26.1 lakh, in real estate and a big fat 0% in stocks. The stock market was friend-zoned not just by the PM, but by his cabinet as well. While the total assets of the top 9 ministers in the Indian government amounted to a staggering ₹91.1 crore, only 2% of them were invested in the stock market. The richest of the bunch was Arun Jaitley, perhaps appropriately the Finance Minister, who has total assets of ₹49.5 crore, a significant portion of which is just cold hard cash sitting as bank deposits. The poorest of the bunch was Suresh Prabhu, perhaps also appropriately the Railway Minister, who has total assets of mere ₹17 lakh. You want to talk about the gap between the rich and the poor? We’ve got that gap right here for you in government’s *navratnas*. 

**Time for Tim: Cook’s India Aftermath**

Tim came, Tim saw but Tim did not conquer. Tim Cook, Apple CEO, visited India a few weeks ago to much media fanfare and met several top government ministers. But to Tim’s disappointment, he failed to convince anyone to allow Apple to launch its famous retail iStores in India. Currently, Apple sells products through a network of dealers. That’s because under current regulations, if Apple wants to open retail stores, it needs to source 30% of content locally. Sourcing 30% locally means Apple would have to start manufacturing in India. Either that, or just buy stuff from local businesses and literally light it on fire. Neither of those things is about to happen. However, under current regulations, Apple can be granted a waiver to the 30% rule but only if Apple is bringing “cutting-edge” technology to India. And in the classic bureaucratic fashion, nobody actually bothered to define what “cutting-edge” would mean. And when you leave crucial terms like that open for interpretation, somewhere somehow a lawyer gets all excited. Now, Apple fanboys might disagree on this but government officials are unlikely to call any of Apple’s technology “cutting-edge” and are widely [expected](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/lDn53REhqvhqGoIxs9MgwJ/Apples-proposal-to-sell-refurbished-iPhones-in-India-reject.html) to decline Apple’s petition for a waiver of the 30% rule. The government is also not a big fan of Apple’s proposal to sell second-hand iPhones in India fearing that the country would become a graveyard for all old iPhones.

* Startups always describe themselves as the Google of this, or the Facebook of that, to the point that it’s become one of the annoying buzzwords of the startup world. While startups always envy such internet giants all year round, they didn’t last week. New rules imposing a levy (called the “Google Tax”) of 6% on anyone who does business of more than ₹1 lakh in a year with foreign online advertising services [kicked](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/corporates/article-google-tax-kicks-in-from-today-5-things-to-know-1414318) in from last week.

* Alright, hands up if you are happy at your job. I can’t really see you, but data says that 8.8 out of 10 people reading this are probably raising their hands right now. Turns out, all the Garfield-esque Monday back-to-work hate might just be a myth. The Edenred-Ipsos Barometer (that's a mouthful!), a yearly survey of well-being at work, has [ranked](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-opportunities/indian-employees-say-their-workplaces-promote-wellbeing/article8674930.ece) Indians at the top when it comes to having positive feelings about work. From 14,400 people in 15 countries, 88% of Indian employees report being satisfied about their work. So if you truly hate your job with a passion - you might be in the minority.

* People do crazy things for love? Try money. Questionable ponzi schemes have taken billions as investments by promoting impossible business ventures like tree plantations and even farming emus, the flightless bird. But here’s the thing with ponzi schemes - they seem to work, until one day they don’t. New legislation [proposed](http://qz.com/695185/finally-india-wants-to-clamp-down-on-savings-schemes-that-have-duped-investors-of-billions-of-dollars/) by the government aims to streamline the process for investigating ponzi schemes and to impose strict jail terms up to 10 years for offenders.

After [launching](http://www.financialexpress.com/auto/news/mahindra-q4-net-profit-jumps-14-4-on-better-uv-tractor-sales/269398/) nine products during the last fiscal year, net profit at M&M for the three months ending March was up 14% to ₹668 crore.

It offers decent hours, doesn’t need special training and isn’t dangerous. But Swiss citizens voted with an overwhelming majority and declined the job offer. Now that I have your attention, the job isn’t tiring or gross either. The job is ...to exist. Swiss citizens [voted](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36454060) down a universal income proposal that would guarantee a minimum income of ₹1.7 lakh/month to every Swiss citizen. Uninformed sources say, the government has decided to use that money to set up much needed mental health checkup facilities in the country.

**Big Oil To Get Fatter**

One of the ideas being thrown around to deal with the bad loans crisis was merging all 27 state-owned banks to make 6 really huge banks. Taking inspiration from that idea, the government is now throwing around another idea - [merging](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/government-set-to-start-talks-on-merging-13-state-oil-companies-to-create-behemoth/articleshow/53371857.cms) 13 big state-owned oil companies to make 1 really huge oil company. Companies like ONGC, Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum lead the list of the 13 companies being considered for this mega-merger. Even as oil prices nearly committed suicide last year, just the top 6 state-owned oil companies still managed to report revenues of ₹9.3 trillions. So clearly, the 1 giant oil company that will come out of these mergers will be big enough to rival the likes of UK’s BP and Russia’s Rosneft. But it will still be a few ranks smaller than some of the biggest oil companies in the world. And at least when it comes to business, size does matter. This idea of merging oil companies isn’t a new idea - it’s been brought up and shot down numerous times in the past mainly due to concerns over reduced competition. Mergers are extra difficult for government companies because after every merger, there’s some extra fat that you have to trim. But government companies tend to focus on social welfare before profit - which means keeping that extra fat to pump up employment in the country. Even if the prospect of this 1 giant oil company with trillions in revenue seems huge right now, rest assured, it won’t be bigger than *yo mama*.

**Gone Are The Days Of Jabong**

The e-commerce industry made multiple headlines last week - the biggest story being the acquisition of Jabong. Flipkart-owned Myntra went shopping around for companies and [dropped](https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/25/rocket-internets-jabong-sold-to-flipkart-owned-rival-myntra-for-70m/) $70 million on Jabong, creating the largest online fashion company. The second-highest bidder for Jabong was Snapdeal which offered $50 million followed by Future Group (that owns the Big Bazaar stores) which offered $35 million. It’s been a tough couple of years for Jabong. Even Amazon, the 800-pound gorilla of the e-commerce business, briefly considered acquiring Jabong for $1 billion back in 2014. Compared to that price tag, Flipkart got a nice discount of 93%. However, the days aren’t as rosy as they sound for Flipkart. Exhibit A - the company just [fired](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/start-ups/article-flipkart-to-lay-off-hundreds-of-underperforming-employees-report-1437780) about 700 employees and tried to play it off as “a fairly common practice”. Exhibit B - Industry reports released last week indicate that Amazon has [surpassed](http://www.firstpost.com/business/most-consumers-preferred-amazon-over-flipkart-for-online-transactions-in-2016-says-survey-2915798.html) Flipkart to become India’s preferred online destination. Exhibit C - Snapdeal reached 1 million daily transacting users, more than those of Flipkart and Amazon put together. Seems like bad news does come in threes.

**RIO MMXVI**

The 2016 Olympic Games are set to begin next week in Brazil. As the media begins extensive coverage of the events, get ready for the millions of Indians that will be shocked to find out about the existence of sports other than cricket and fighting trolls online. Just as the international media came at India with pitchforks drawn for botching up the 2010 Commonwealth Games, let’s turn those pitchforks around and poke other countries for mismanaging international sporting events. The host nation, Brazil is going through its worst economic crisis since 1930 and its worst health crisis since 1918. The country’s GDP contracted by 4% in 2015, and is expected to [contract](http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-02-22/budget-rio-olympics-16-times-higher-budget-combat-zika-virus) by another 3% in 2016. Plus there’s the small matter of Zika viruses roaming around giving birth defects to unborn babies. Technically, the country doesn’t have a President since the most recent one was suspended under charges of corruption. Considering all of that, just the fact that Brazil hasn’t descended into anarchy is an achievement. The government has allocated $9.7 billion for the Olympic Games, which is 16 times more than the budget allocated to deal with the Zika virus that has already infected 1.5 million Brazilians. Hashtag Priorities. However, every Olympic Game since 1968 has exceeded its budget by an average of 179% which means that $9.7 billion could very well balloon up to $17 billion. Godspeed Brazil, godspeed.

**News Flash: Old Age Is Tough**

Most people’s idea of preparing for retirement includes investing in 1) Fixed Deposits, 2) Mutual Funds or 3) A kid or two. But a survey by the investment bank HSBC [found](http://zeenews.india.com/business/news/finance/47-indians-not-saving-for-retirement-hsbc_1908299.html) that 47% of the working people in India haven’t even started saving for retirement. No need to panic - the global average is around the same at 46% - so the rest of the world is as deep in this swamp as India. The HSBC survey also found the 80% of Indians seek advice about retirement from friends and family - which basically means that your primary source of information about retirement is that one balding uncle you have who walks around with a beer belly and midlife crisis. That’s just one survey. Here’s another - the annual Global Retirement Index published by Natixis, one of the biggest asset management companies in France, [ranked](http://qz.com/737382/india-is-the-worst-place-in-the-world-to-retire-2/) India as the 43rd best country to retire. That doesn’t seem so bad until you realize that the Index only tracks 43 countries to begin with, and India finished last. Dispelling any notions that India finished last due to all the nice guys in the country, the index mentioned the pitiful state of India’s healthcare system as one of the reasons that we finished last. Meanwhile, Norway and Switzerland were ranked as the best places to retire.

*“I am silent because there is conflict between my scholarly commitment to economics and my loyalty to the party's decided issues.”* - Subramanian Swamy, member of parliament [tweeting](http://www.thestatesman.com/news/india/subramanian-swamy-mum-on-gst-cites-party-loyalty/158145.html) about why he is silent on the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill that his political party supports so much. Just going to leave this here for you to draw your own conclusions.

**Going Gaga Over GST**

Last week, the Rajya Sabha [passed](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/gst-bill-pass-what-next-step-by-step-until-the-rollout-2952723/) the Goods and Services Tax (GST) - the tax reform that has been heralded as the most important piece of legislation in over a decade. While the common market of Europe is walking backwards due to Brexit, the common market within India is stepping ahead due to GST. The bill has been the subject of political bickering for a long time now. However, it was passed with 203 votes for and none against. With 0 votes against. They didn’t even blink twice, so you know there families weren’t being held hostage and all votes were entirely voluntary. But this has only been the tip of the iceberg. Even though both houses of the parliament have passed the bill, there is a laundry list of things that need to happen before we can all go home and forget about this whole GST business. The Lok Sabha needs to approve the bill once again. Then, a minimum of 15 state governments need to pass the bill. Then, the president needs to sign the bill. Then, a GST Council needs to be formed and the GST tax rate needs to be negotiated. Then, the central government needs to pass two supporting laws, and each state needs to pass a separate supporting law. And only then, we’ll be able to pocket all that cash from the GST-led economic growth that is being predicted. The deadline set for all of this is April 1st, 2017. Till then, government officials around the country are set to debate on extremely sensitive issues like whether cream biscuits should be taxed at the same rate as ordinary biscuits. #TeamBourbon.

**Uber-Didi**

Uber joined the long list of American MNCs that came to do business in China but inevitably fell on their faces. In a deal announced last week, the popular ride-hailing service will sell its China operations to rival Didi Chuxing in [exchange](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/business/dealbook/china-uber-didi-chuxing.html?_r=0) for a 20% stake in Didi, who will invest $1 billion in Uber. The two giants have been battling for the Chinese market for years and despite spending billions of dollars, no one has managed to turn a profit. In fact, Uber was facing a loss of $1 billion annually due to heavy competition in China. Once upon a time, Uber’s future in China seemed to hold promise. And now, the company is throwing in the towel. The company’s mistake? It tried to fight a land war in Asia. Although Didi was the bigger company in China in terms of market share, Uber did have its moments. Such as when a Chinese hip-hop artist posted a gangster rap song about how much he prefers Uber. Don’t Baidu it - China being China censored the whole thing just days later.

**Loans For *Pani Puri wala*s**

Banks use all sorts of fancy algorithms to determine if a borrower will repay a loan. Despite all of that, with the banking crisis, a huge amount of loans are at a risk of being Vijay Mallya-ed. So the fancy algorithms haven’t exactly worked out. Another one of those fancy things that banks use is a credit score. A good credit score will have banks lining outside your door shouting for your attention. A bad credit score will have you lining outside the door of the banks with a ton of paperwork. You need a good credit score to get loans. But to get a good credit score, you need to repay loans. So you see the chicken-and-egg problem here. This means a lot of people don’t even have credit scores. But those people still need loans. And banks won’t touch them with a ten-foot pole. Now, microfinance companies like Edelweiss, Bharat Financial, DHFL and many more are going places feared by the big boys of finance. A big push in the industry is to loan [money](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/saturated-cities-now-even-idli-vada-seller-can-get-loan/articleshow/53515598.cms) to pavement hawkers, scrap dealers and other self-employed individuals. For example - the makers of the extremely healthy chinese food at the hand-kart that parks near the local sewer every evening. Basically, giving loans to low-income borrowers without a credit score or any kind of formal financial history. If that sounds like a recipe for trouble, that’s because it is and we’ve already had that dish in the run-up of the financial crisis of 2008. And if history isn’t repeating itself here, it’s definitely rhyming.


**Too Many Branches Spoil The Bank**

The State Bank Of India has almost 17,000 branches which is very impressive. Especially since they get to brag about it in tables that rank banks by number of branches. But the bank isn’t doing itself any favours by putting 5 branches within a 1 km radius of each other, as is the case a lot of times with SBI. Because sometimes, it’s not the size that matters, it’s what you do with it that matters. And SBI is [considering](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/sbi-weighs-plan-to-shut-relocate-30-of-its-branches/articleshow/53494912.cms) a proposal to do away with such extra branches by consolidating them. It might make common sense to shut down branches when put like that, but then they won’t get to brag about how many branches they have. And investors love those kind of things. SBI is currently in the process of merging with its associate banks from Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore and so on. It expects to have that completed by March 2017. At which point, that 17,000 number will balloon up to 24,000 branches, compounding that problem. A global consulting firm, McKinsey which was hired by SBI has recommended shutting down upto of 7,200 of those branches. Moreover, bank branches are so *2000s*. Online is where it’s at.

In future space missions, the company expects to make money by mining for natural resources on moon, specifically mining for Helium-3. This would’ve happened a lot sooner if only the moon had some oil. Helium-3 is all fine... But it’s no oil.

**7th Pay Commission**

If entrepreneurship is where ambitions get fulfilled, a 9-to-5 bureaucratic government desk job is where ambitions get killed. A government job is an excellent way to start your career, if what you want is to also end your career in a government job because once you’re in there, you really need to screw up big time to be thrown out. How big? You could even skip work for 24 years before being fired like [this](https://www.rt.com/news/221543-india-government-employee-fired/) guy. Along with the literally fire-proof long-term job security, there’s also the chance of making a little buck from time to time with bribes - although few will admit it. But the jobs do come with the downside of being low paid. And the government is working to change that. Every ten years since independence, the government appoints a “pay commission” that recommends what to change in the salaries of over 1 crore government employees and pensioners. The government recently accepted the recommendations of the 7th and the latest pay commission which include an average pay hike of about 24%. It [estimates](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/7th-pay-commission-salary-hike-govt-salary-hike-arun-jaitley-2886723/) spending an additional ₹1 lakh crore (that’s 1 followed by 12 zeros) annually to accommodate increased salaries and pensions. Some of the money will presumably go right back into government coffers through taxes. But a range of other issues have stuck out as thorns and lakhs of government employees have threatened to go on strike if they remain unresolved.

**The Banks Need A Stress Ball**

It's been a long, long time since the RBI’s crusade against bad loans in the banking system started. But it doesn’t show any signs of stopping in the near future as the situation has only deteriorated. And if things continue going downhill, banks like the Bank of Maharashtra will probably have to switch slogans from ‘One Family One Bank’ to ‘One Bank One Bankruptcy’. The most recent round of stress tests at the RBI indicate that the banks are in desperate need of a vacation to de-stress for a little bit. The central bank [warned](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/stability-of-banks-has-worsened-significantly/article8784540.ece) that stability in the banking system has significantly worsened since mid-2010s. There is no use praying for the speedy recovery of our banking system as even the RBI did not exactly sound optimistic. At minimum, the central bank expects the amount of bad loans to rise from 7.6% this year to 8.5% next year. And at maximum, that figure can reach 9.3%. Profitability at the banks is in the dumps, having gone [down](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/takeaways-from-rbis-stress-test-banks-very-close-to-tipping-point/articleshow/52967108.cms) by 43% due to write-offs. Looking back at this mess, you can’t help but wonder what will happen if the banking crisis hits a tipping point, if the Punjab National Bank goes from ‘The Name You Can Bank Upon’ to ‘The Name That Just Went Bankrupt’.

**One Giant Leap for ISRO**

Every time ISRO makes news with a launch, you get that occasional story in your social feed that you like without reading and feel proud for about an hour, space exploration replaces Salman Khan on the list of things people care about, #ISRO trends on twitter, NRIs get that occasional feeling of guilt over contributing to brain drain and Shahrukh Khan is relevant because Swades. Well, here’s the story that you might’ve already seen and liked without reading: last week, ISRO made news in the global space commerce industry by [launching](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/isro-throws-satellite-making-open-to-private-sector-1423043) 20 satellites in one rocket. 17 of the 20 satellites were from foreign customers of Antrix, the commercial arm of ISRO.  It’s really anyone’s guess how much Antrix or ISRO charges for one satellite launch, but Antrix did report revenues of over ₹1,800 crore in 2015. But the launch wasn’t the only ISRO event making news. AS Kiran Kumar, chairman of ISRO invited the private sector to make a full spacecraft. So far, private companies like Larsen & Toubro or Godrej Aerospace have only manufactured the components that go into the making of a satellite.

**Time To Go Public**

India has two stock exchanges that really matter - the NSE and the BSE. So if those two companies wish to go public and list on the stock market, they’ve got two options to begin with. One, list shares on the rival stock exchange and risk being regulated by a competitor. Or two, list shares on it’s own stock exchange which is prohibited by regulations due to being the most obvious conflict of interest since the makers of sliced bread said it was the best thing ever. While the BSE is already in the process of listing shares and going public, the NSE [entered](http://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/nse-plans-to-file-ipo-document-by-jan-2017/article8779637.ece) the fray last week by announcing plans to go public as well. Interestingly, along with plans to list shares in India, the company also intends to list overseas by April of next year. It’s a fantastic time of the year to go public. Despite the naysayers of Brexit, recent IPOs have [received](http://www.reuters.com/article/india-ipos-idUSL4N19Q22K) a lot attention from investors and the IPO pipeline currently has big names like Vodafone, ICICI Prudential and L&T Infotech.

A second attempt to auction his private luxury jet [failed](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/vijay-mallyas-personal-jet-on-auction-only-bidder-offers-rs-1-crore-1427051) as exactly one buyer showed up and bid ₹1 crore, which was way below the minimum price of ₹152 crore. Earlier this year, attempts to auction the Kingfisher House for ₹150 crore and Kingfisher brands for ₹327 crore failed as well since no bidders showed up.

* When popular party songs overuse catchphrases like *“Party all night!”*, what they really mean to say is, *“Party till 1 AM when the bar will close and kick us out at which point the party will stop!”*. You can see the problem - it doesn’t rhyme well. But that might not matter for long. The central government [cleared](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/Goodbye-curfew-hours/articleshow/52982257.cms) a law allowing restaurants, bars, shops, movie theaters and more to remain open 24x7, so you actually can party all night. Aimed at increasing employment, the law lifts the collective curfew placed on all Indians. However, the final decision to implement or ignore the change has been left to state governments.

* The battle for the Iron Throne continues - the shortlist of candidates who will step into the oversized shoes of our current RBI Governor is [down](http://www.financialexpress.com/article/economy/rbis-new-governor-all-you-want-to-know-about-the-four-shortlisted-candidates/298239/) from seven to four. It includes one current deputy RBI governor, two former deputy RBI governors and one chairperson of a bank.

* After all the media attention that the Panama Papers generated, a Swiss bank account just isn’t cool anymore. Money [held](http://zeenews.india.com/business/news/economy/indian-money-in-swiss-banks-drops-by-one-third-to-rs-8392-crore_1901938.html) by Indian citizens in Swiss banks fell by one third to a record low of about ₹8,400 crore. This statistic comes in the middle of the 90-day window given by the government where it has [promised](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/sm685foUYic1odLvsTAgOI/Come-clean-by-30-September-Arun-Jaitley-to-black-money-hold.html) to not investigate anyone who declares black money, and pays a 45% tax including a penalty. But the question is - can you trust the government to honour its end of the agreement? You just know that at the very least, your name is going to end up on some “special watchlist” at the Income Tax Department.

###Footnote Stories

When you buy insurance, you’re really just buying a promise. A promise that you’ll get more money in case something happens. Turns out, promises don’t exactly have a lot of shipping fees and so they can be easily sold online. The regulatory agency for the insurance industry, the IRDA has come out with draft regulations aimed at [promoting](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/soon-more-players-can-hawk-insurance-online/article8710516.ece) the sale of insurance via e-commerce. But you’re also going to need an e-insurance account to buy insurance online, just like you need a demat account to buy shares online.

Railway passengers will soon be able to [order](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/food/coming-soon-pizzas-and-burgers-on-trains/articleshow/52948443.cms) burgers and pizzas of their choice on the Indian Railways website and have them delivered right to their coaches. With 12,000 trains carrying 23 million passengers every day, the potential is huge. The business of delivering food is where a delay of mere minutes can turn your customer from just hungry to hungry and annoyed. And if there is one thing that the Indian Railways is known for, it is for never having any delays at all.

Business/Finance,[RANT] Reality v/s Perception about the state of affairs in Bengal (economically).,14,3rvcoi,deepayan99,73,"The trend right now is to continuously harp on certain shortcomings and create an environment of negativity about Bengal. And it's shocking how the ones who leave Bengal are busy bad-mouthing the state the most. That actually causes a very negative perception about it.

Contrary to the prevalent perception, the Bengal govt has done a significant amount of work in the last 4 years. Lets talk about them first.

->Growth:

i) Gross Value Added- India is growing at 7.5 percent while West Bengal is growing at 10.48 percent 

ii) Agriculture- India is growing at 1.1 percent, West Bengal is growing at 6.46 percent 

iii) Industries - India 5.6 percent, West Bengal 8.34 percent 

iv) Services- India 10.9 percent, West Bengal 12.12 percent

v) Per Capita Income - India 6.1 percent, West Bengal 12.12 percent.

These are as per statistics of the Central Statistical Organisation.

-> Investment Proposals:

i) Since TMC came to office, Rs 84,923 crore of investments are either completed or in process.

ii) In the Bengal Global Business Summit, Rs 2,43,000 crore of investment proposals are tabled and work has already started on the Rs 91000 crore within the last five months. 

iii) Changi airport has come to West Bengal creating the first ever with BAPL private sector greenfield airport in India, nobody talks about that. What is interesting is 1800 acres around the airport - 56 percent of which will have to be non-polluting industry is going to come up there, transforming that entire area as an Aerotropolis. 

iv) SAIL is already implementing on a promised Rs 16000 crore investment in the state and has now promised another Rs 40000 crore of investment. 

v) Anil Ambani's group is investing in cement. 

vi) Tata Metaliks has asked for expansion of its plant. 

vii) NTPC is coming up with two more power plants,work has already started on those. 

viii) TCS is almost ready with a new campus bringing in 20000 new jobs. Cognizant and Wipro have announced 5000 and 2400 new jobs respectively. 

ix) Wipro has started work on the construction of a new campus already. 

x) The largest Software Technology Park of India (STPI) is coming up in Kolkata for a Rs 100 crore investment. 

xi) Caparro Group has committed to investing in a small car manufacturing hub in Bengal,land has already been bought.

xii) Bengal Birbhum Coalfields, the newly formed company in which Bengal has the largest share, could well be a game changer for the industry-starved state.The company will develop Deocha Pachami, the country's largest mineable coal block, which happens to be in West Bengal's Birbhum district. 

xiii)Chinese bus manufacturing company Zhongtong has decided to set up an assembling unit at the airport city in Burdwan's Andal. The company has proposed to invest Rs 250 crore in the first phase and scale it up to Rs 1,500 crore. Zhongtong plans to manufacture buses in Andal later. 

xiv) Mahindra & Mahindra is investing 150 crores in Kharagpur.

->Finance Hub

Setting up a greenfield Finance Hub is a real tough thing. BKC took 3 decades to get built. Bangalore tried this. It failed. GIFT Tried this. In spite of ""Brand Gujarat"" and PR skills of Modi, it has failed to attract as many investors as New Town Finance Hub attracted. Getting 19 national level Financial Institutions commit investment by buying land at 13 crore / acre in a time span of 4 years is just AMAZING boss..
Is the Media ever coming up with these news? Even if they are coming up, they are portraying these things in negative light telling how many plots are yet to be sold.

->Tourism:

i) We know what traffic Darjeeling was receiving before TMC came. If you want check the pre-2011 statistics of Bagdogra Airport. Annual traffic was around 2-3 Lakhs. Last year (2015 March) it reached the mark of 1 million air passengers / year. in 2011, Bimal Gurung and his gang was creating trouble almost every other day through Bandhs and stuffs like that. Do we hear of those things now? That was MB's diplomacy and political shrewdness .

ii) Jangalmahal: It was a Naxalite den. Today we have several tourism initiatives happening there , tourists are visiting those places in good numbers. Bengalis love to roam around. They are getting new places to visit in WB itself. Tourism industry ( hotels and cottages) does not require much land and generates a lot of blue-collar employment in the form of drivers, stewards, cooks, guides,etc.

That's what a good administration was supposed to deliver.

->Financial Improvement

i) In 2010-11 (March 2011), debt-GDP ratio was 40%. In March 2015, it was 33%. 

ii) WB Govt own tax Revenue in March 2011: 21,000 crore WB Govt own tax Revenue in March 2015: 41,000 crore 

iii) Capital investment in state budget ( investment in creation of physical assets i.e. Roads, Bridges, irrigation canals,etc) increased by more than 500% in 4 years.

Does media ever report these incidents?

iv)Revenue Doubling happened at a time when oil prices crashed and state govt's tax collection on petrol and diesel got severely impacted.

Don't you think these show better administrative skills?

->Kanyashree Programme and Fair Price Medicine Shops

Similar models are getting implemented across many states at all-India level now. We know the good points of these schemes.This is a unique example where United Nations is now saying 53 developing countries who met in London must adopt the Kanyashree program.

->Revival of State PSUs

i)Only three states have discoms that are profitable (without subsidies) - West Bengal, Goa and Maharastra - according to the Planning Commission. 

ii) Transport PSUs were sucking up hundreds of crores of subsidy every year. Daily earnings of CSTC in 2011: 20 lakhs Daily earnings of CSTC in 2015: 30 lakhs

Now almost all the transport PSUs are profitable.

iii) Loss making Tantuja and Manjusha is profitable now. So is the newly launched Biswa Bangla Brand. It's not just about profit of these PSUs. More Profitable these companies are, more weavers, craftsmen, handloom workers can benefit from these platforms by getting more orders and earning more money. More direct as well as indirect employment is generated. Also , these profits form ""non-tax revenue"" of state budget, which helps in more capital investment.

Again, is the Media ever highlighting these things?

->FAILURES

The major failure has been in generating white collar jobs ( Both in IT and Manufacturing). And this happened because they did not market ""Brand Bengal"" well. Not giving SEZ Permission was perhaps the most stupid decision ever.

But Media is continuously highlighting these stuffs only. In 5 years, there has been only 2 Foreign Trips by MB and Media is complaining. On the Contrary, MB and her bureaucrats should have made several trips to Silicon Valley and should have tried to incentivize more Hi-Tech Companies to establish R&D Centres in Kolkata.

->BOTTOMLINE:

Every State has its own problems.

Do people in Bangalore always complain about broken roads? Do people in Gujarat always complain why GIFT could never become a success in almost 9 years or why Ahmedabad could never become a big IT Hub?

No....Boss....No

Business/Finance,Here's why India shouldn't adopt the Nordic welfare model,39,2gg76m,rafaellvandervaart,105,"DECONSTRUCTION OF THE NORDIC MODEL

Most problems that India face now can be attributed to consequences of Nehruvian socialism that this country has adopted for about 45 years. I am from Kerala and here the Politics cannot be separated from communism and despite being an age old relic, it still refuses to die out.

Since the reforms that was carried out in 1991 most millennial Indians have largely rejected such archaic concepts focusing more on modernity. But in this context a new concept has largely caught the fancy of most new age Indians: The Nordic model. As such in my experience I see more people supporting Nordic model over communism currently in Kerala. 

In this slightly lengthy post, I will try to deconstruct the Nordic model from two angles.

1. Nordic viability in India
2. Efficacy of Nordic model

First a note on Nordic model. Nordic model or Nordic capitalism or Nordic social democracy refers to the economic and social models of the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden), which involves the combination of a free market economy with a welfare state. More or less implemented around the mid 60s, this is said to have promoted a sustainable state and economy in these countries. Calls have been made among policy makers in India, with special mention to Nobel prize winning welfare economist Amartya Sen, to implement reforms along the Nordic lines in India

NORDIC VIABILITY IN INDIA

Nordic Socialism: Indian proponents of Nordic model advocate establishing a state along the social democracy lines. But the truth is that Scandinavia isn't really all that socialist. Scandinavian countries have certain socialist characteristics such as high taxes and extensive welfare systems. However, these countries have relatively capitalistic markets. Scandinavian businesses are mostly free from regulation, nationalization and protectionism. Sweden, Denmark and Finland rank higher than US in in business freedom, monetary freedom, investment freedom, fiscal freedom, property freedom and freedom from corruption. Norway ranks higher than the US in trade freedom, property freedom and freedom from corruption. 

Source: http://www.heritage.org/index/explore

The overall point here is that Scandinavian countries have fairly capitalistic business environments. Until India, which has abysmal rankings in all these parameters, achieve free business environment and comparable income levels it should not consider a comparable welfare model.

 Economic calculation problem: First proposed by Ludwig von Mises, it describes the signalling function of prices. Prices of goods are signals to entrepreneurs to adequately allocate their resources. When economic planning is added to the mix, it distorts the market forces and prices. This in turn facilitates inefficient allocation of resources and wastage. In a macro scale this presents itself as inflation. Larger the economy, harder it becomes to ""plan"". Scandinavian nations are all small economies with homogeneous economic components and it would be relatively easier to centralize function there (But it has not been without its demerits, more on that below). India is one of the largest and the most diverse economy in the world in terms of the economic components involved. As such India is last candidate for any sort of planning. History has shown that most planning here has met with some sort of counterproductive unintended consequence and the inflation numbers here speaks for itself.

Bureaucracy and social trust: Scandinavian countries are characterized by high levels of social liberalism and trust. Research finds that high levels of social trust increase economic growth. According to one study, ""The size of the effect in most studies is such that 10 percentage points higher trust is associated with half a percentage point higher annual growth rate. In the Scandinavian countries, about 60 percent agree that most people can be trusted, which can be compared to the OECD average of about just 40 percent.

Source: http://journalistsresource.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Govt-Size-and-Growth.pdf

There is also the case of the highly transparent nature of the bureaucracy in the Scandinavian nations. As with the trust worthy nature of the bureaucrats there, they can be trusted with governing functions of the state. Bureaucracy is India on the other hand is an absolute mess. India features almost at the bottom of the transparency index. As evidenced by the corruption, Bureaucrats here simply cannot be trusted with any action and would be best left free of bureaucratic control.

Source: http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2013/results/#myAnchor1

Taxation problem: Scandinavian nations are characterized by high levels of taxation on income. Although I will go into the problems of Nordic model below, it must be said that these countries grow in spite of high taxes, not because of them. Indeed, several studies which examine taxation across developed countries show that when other determinants of growth are accounted for, taxation seriously diminishes growth. At the same time it must be added that while these countries have high tax on incomes, the corporate levels are low. Corporate tax average of Scandinavian nations is about 25% compared to about 40% in USA. So it is possible that the corporate sector there is balancing the economy. Hence higher tax levels are not an option in India where industry and corporate sectors constitute only a marginal share of the overall economy.

http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1699715

Economic history of Nordic nations: Most Scandianavian nations instituted the Nordic model in mid 1960s. Before this most of these countries reaped benefit from high growth facilitated by laissez faire policies and neutrality in the World Wars. Welfare system that you see now wouldn't have been possible had it not been for the surplus it had made during their laissez faire era. India on the other hand has no Laissez faire history. It is a country which is home to half of the world's poor. By instituting a welfare state, India would be incentivizing these poor souls to continue in their misery.

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/9YhKdaE.png

Norway : Norway is an exception among Nordic nations itself. Oil was discovered in the North Sea in 1960 after which the country made its switch to welfare state. When liberals in US point to the per-capita GDP of Norway, they forget to mention that much of this is a result of big oil interests. Norway is the largest oil producer and exporter in all of Western Europe. Norway produces roughly 200 barrels of oil per person per year. That puts it at number 5 in the world for per capita oil production. In other words, Norway is successful despite its government, not because of its government. India is largely import dependent when it comes to oil and has very few proven oil reserves. It cannot bank on resource wealth to fund its welfare state.

EFFICACY OF THE NORDIC MODEL

In this portion, I will discuss the problems with Nordic model itself. Given below are series of comparisons he made between Scandinavian nations and USA under various parameters. While US itself is no paragon of capitalism. Over the years it has show relatively high levels of free markets which has slightly regressed in the recent years. The main difference between the American system and the Nordic Model is that America has a medium-size welfare state and the Nordic nations have large welfare states. That explains, at least in part, why the U.S. economy generally outperforms the Nordic Model. US stats were easily available online, so I took that. Give me a beak.

As seen in Figure below US has enjoyed a faster rate of growth.According to the OECD, the U.S. grew by an average of 3 percent between 1981 and 1991 and 3.3 percent between 1992 and 2006 (meaning average growth of 3.2 percent for 1981 to 2006). The Nordic nations, by contrast, grew by an average of 2.2 percent between 1981 and 1991 and 2.7 percent from 1992 to 2006(meaning average growth of 2.5 percent over the entire period). The IMF, meanwhile, reports that U.S. growth averaged 3.1 percent from 1981–2006 compared to an average of 2.6 percent for Nordic nations in the same period.

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/gpTtjiA.png

Figure below, measures of per capita GDP from the World Bank, the OECD, the IMF, and the CIA all show that Americans haveabout $6,000 of additional economic output per person, significantly more than $20,000 for each family of four.

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/ilG5UVr.png

Although per capita GDP is an excellent measure of overall economic output relative to population, it does not necessarily measure living standards. Comparing U.S. and Nordic living standards requires numbers for disposable income. The OECD series for disposable income in the Figure below. According to a study using 2003 data, the average person in the US had more than $27,000 of disposable income, while the average person in Nordic nations Had disposable income of barely $14,300, less than 53 percentof the U.S. level. Even Norwegians, bolstered by oil wealth, had per capita disposable income of less than $16,800, barely 62 percent of the American level. Danes and Finns are at the bottom, with less than 50 percent of the disposable income of the average American. 

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/anuxd8j.png

Personal consumption: In 2005, the Danish Finance Ministry produced numbers comparing per capita private consumption in OECD nations. As seen in Figure below, the average person in Nordic nations has barely 51 percent as much private consumption as an average American. The Norwegians are the most prosperous, but even their private consumption is just 56 percent of U.S. levels. Both the Swedes and the Finns have less than 50 percent of the private consumption of average Americans. 

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/jIIqdoc.png

As expected by the nature of free markets Nordic countries lag US when it comes to per capita GDP growth

Figure: http://i.imgur.com/gjBFuGG.png

Last but not least, defenders of the Nordic Model argue that the US suffers from greater levels of income inequality. Various measures of inequality, such as Gini coefficients, confirm that “wealthy” Americans earn a bigger share of the pie than Upperincome citizens in Nordic nations. But this data is incomplete without also looking at the size of the pie. As illustrated in Figure below, the poorest 10 percent of Americans have about the same level of income as the poorest 10 percent of Finns, Swedes, and Danes. Only in oil-rich Norway is there a noticeable gap (data for Iceland not available). What differentiates America from the Nordic nations is the income of everyone else. The rich, the middle class, and the working class in the US enjoy higher levels of income than their Nordic counterparts. If nations are being judged on the prosperity of their poorest citizens, then Nordic nations certainly are equal to the US. Indeed, they even have a slight advantage (though even that advantage might disappear if Nordic nations had US levels of immigration). But if nations are being judged on factors beyond just the well-being on the poorest segment of the population, then the US holds a clear edge.

CONCLUSION

Excessive government diminishes growth. And although the Nordic countries’ relatively free markets mitigate the damage caused by high taxes and high spending, the burden of government is hindering economic performance. The Nordic Model is preferable to the Continental or Corporatist Model of nations such as France and Germany, which combines welfare state policies and interventionism. When I was researching this , Google news showed that Sweden plans to scale back it welfare state due to pressure. 

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/11/swedish-elections-cracks-showing-nordic-model

These AAP Kejriwal types are constantly backing a welfare state. I am not against AP or anything, if they can just fix their economic policies, I'll be all for them. Milton Friedman famously said that you cannot have a Welfare state and open borders. Sweden seems to learning that lesson. In India's case Free markets is the best option.

**Food (Wastage, Inflation)**

Shin Chan used to separate out *shimla mirch* from his meals and throw them in the trash because he didn’t like them. And also because he didn’t understand the economics of food wastage and inflation in modern India. A review by Economic Times last week [reported](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/save/food-wastage-can-cost-a-family-rs-80-lakh/articleshow/53127874.cms) that if the average family reduces food wastage by half and invested the savings at 10% returns, it can add up to ₹21 lakh in 30 years. However, that is not a static number since food prices tend to rise with inflation. And the inflation numbers for June [back](http://www.firstpost.com/business/cpi-inflation-at-5-77-should-ring-alarm-bells-for-new-rbi-governor-2890602.html) that claim. Food inflation was at 7.79% in June, up from 7.47% in May. Specifically, inflation in vegetables was about 14% in June, up from about 10% in May. So the next time your mother tells you to eat your vegetables, just pinch your nose and eat those godforsaken things that masquerade around as food. While that number only looks at food prices, consumer inflation which looks at prices in general stayed pretty much the same at 5.77%. Far from being a reason to pop open the champagne, “pretty much the same” still means a 22-month high. That 5.77% number should ring alarm bells for the RBI because if it crosses 6%, the RBI is required to explain to the government why it failed at keeping inflation in check. 

  

**The Business Of Cricket**

Baba Karl Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. But in India, you could easily replace religion with cricket in that sentence and it would still stand true. With cows being the only thing more sacred that cricket in India, all that religious obsession over cricket has made gods out of cricketers. And cricketers have raked in the money as they’ve turned themselves into a brand. Just a short list of businesses that Virat Kohli owns partly or entirely includes a chain of fitness centers, a clothing line, a tennis team, a football team, a wrestling team and a sport-based social network. And he’s adding one more to that list. Mr. Kohli is now a co-owner of his own [fanclub](http://yourstory.com/2016/05/virat-kohli-fanbox-privyplex/) called ‘Virat FanBox’ that sells a branded edition of Moto G smartphone that comes preloaded with his app that gives users exclusive access to him. With a price tag of ₹16,999, Virat FanBox also gets you a signed miniature cricket bat and one-year subscription to his fanclub. And of course, it has to come in a box, otherwise the name wouldn’t make sense. Time for a confession - that was news in May, not last week. Last Week In Indian Economy, bringing you week-old, and sometimes even months-old stale and smelly news since 2016. More recently though, last week Dhoni’s apparel and footwear brand Seven [marked](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/dhonis-brand-seven-grosses-over-2-5-million-in-three-months/articleshow/53221126.cms) a milestone of $2.5 million in sales just three months after launching. 

  

**Gotta Catch ‘Em All!**

It started with Angry Birds. Then came Flappy Bird. And now we don’t exactly have another bird, but we have Pokemon Go. The augmented reality mobile gaming app has instantly catapulted to so much popularity that it is now bigger than Tinder and Twitter. The internet managed to give it the hug of death as well. With more than 15 million (official) [downloads](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/pokemon-nintendo-business-implications-augmented-000000901.html) from 26 countries, the mobile game had to stop new players from signing up because the traffic had pushed its servers over the edge. Perhaps more noteworthy is the fact that it has managed to do the impossible. It’s managed to bring out hordes of nerds from underground basements to open-air gardens and parks, many of whom are just finding out that they are allergic to sunlight. It’s also managed to bring the stock of Nintendo up by 106% in the past two weeks. Nintendo owns 32% of The Pokemon Company, which is reportedly [making](http://www.wsj.com/articles/pokemon-chasing-investors-send-nintendo-shares-soaring-1468228206) an estimated $1.6 million per day in revenues from the game. For Nintendo, this couldn’t have come at a better time - the company’s profits fell by 61% last year due to weak sales of its console Wii U.

  

**Let The Games Begin! Again.**

The earnings season is here again. Which means newspapers don’t have to worry about filling empty space anymore. This earnings season was kicked off by three high profile names - Infosys, TCS and Reliance. As oil prices recover in the global market, petrochemical major Reliance [reported](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/results/ril-q1-beats-estimates-profit4-grm-surges-to-361150bbl_7047161.html) a 4.4% increase in net profits beating expectations. The company’s currently busy preparing for a commercial launch of Reliance Jio, it’s foray into the telecom business. Moving over to names in the IT industry that reported earnings - When Donald Trump rants about foreigners stealing American jobs, this is part of what he’s unknowingly referring to. Both IT companies, TCS and Infosys are in the business of helping multinational corporations outsource their work and business is booming. But only for one of them. TCS [reported](http://in.reuters.com/article/tcs-q1-results-idINKCN0ZU15T) a better-than-expected 11% rise in net profit but dalal street had no love for the stock which remained flat. Perhaps due to fears over Brexit since the UK contributes 15% to the company’s revenue while the rest of Europe adds another 12%. On the other hand, while Infosys did post a 13% rise in profits, but it [lowered](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/infosys-posts-lacklustre-q1-result-slashes-outlook-2917009/) its predictions of the profit it might report throughout the rest of the year. Definitely no love for the stock which is down over 8%.

* Former RBI Governor D. Subbarao’s memoir called “Who moved my interest rate?” hit the stands last week. In the tell-all book that may cause some embarrassment to prominent leaders in the government, Subbarao [gives](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/d-subbaraos-memoirs-manmohan-singh-ignored-finance-minister-on-subbarao-term/article8850380.ece) all the dirty details of his stressful relationships with then finance ministers P. Chidambaram and Pranab Mukherjee. Since this book comes 3 years after his term as Governor ended, all we have to do now is wait 3 years for Raghuram Rajan (or “R3” as the social media calls him) to write a book revealing the real reason behind his resignation. Mark your calendars for 2019. 
  

* Recent research reports [indicate](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/earn/which-it-jobs-will-survive-automation-find-out/articleshow/53127553.cms) that Indian IT and Services industry is scheduled to lose about 6.4 lakh low-skilled jobs to automation over the next five years. Ugh, not another robots are taking over our jobs story. Although all the jobs at risk are at the bottom of the pyramid, this is alarming since the $160 billion IT industry is one of India’s biggest employers. We already have an R3, won’t be long before we get an R2-D2 as well. 
  

* Air India is certainly not a private sector airliner. But a lot of bureaucrats treat Air India like their own private airliner. Part of that is because they’re mandated by law to travel by Air India. That might be changing soon. In a potential policy change, bureaucrats may be [allowed](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/air-india-may-lose-privilege-of-being-sole-carrier-of-government-staff-if-cabinet-note-goes-through/articleshow/53144940.cms) to choose the airline that offers the lowest fare rather than having to travel on Air India. So, Air India may lose the privilege of being sole carrier of government babus. Although, was it really a privilege before this? 
  
* You know how the bad guys in every movie always carry black suitcases full of cash to a drug deal? How much cash do you reckon is inside those suitcases?

**Pip Pip, Guv’nah!**

It’s here, and it’s real. The referendum to decide Britain’s fate took place last week, and a lot of things have hit the fan since then. It’s time for the Brits to wake up and smell the tea. With a 52% share of the vote, the Brexit camp won, which means the UK will now [leave](http://www.vox.com/2016/6/17/11963668/brexit-uk-eu-explained) the EU. It won’t happen next week, or next month - they now need to go through a complex procedure that can potentially take about 2 years to complete before officially becoming EU-free. They need to negotiate the terms of the exit with the EU as well as sort out some internal affairs that had been managed by the EU until now. The EU which accounts for 1/4th of global economy is also India’s single largest export market. To ELI5 the effect this will have on India - previously, Indian companies had to satisfy only one rule in order to sell products everywhere in Europe. But now, they will have to satisfy one rule in order to sell products in the UK, and another rule in order to sell products everywhere else in Europe. Nevertheless, the headline news here is that most of UK just went, “Farewell, European Union!”. Or more accurately, as the Brits would say, “Cheerio, buggers!”. 



**You Get To Exit, And You Get To Exit, Everybody Gets to Exit**

There are exits and then there are exits. But it all started with the Rexit (Rajan exiting the RBI). Now coincidentally, we’ve got an exodus of people in business and economics leaving their positions. YC Deveshwar, who’s been for 20 years the head of ITC, the billion dollar cigarettes-to-hotels firm is [leaving](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/uhmto3w6LYTfdGcXfcdjLN/Deveshwar-to-lead-ITC-as-nonexecutive-chairman-after-term-e.html) next year. SK Roy, the head of LIC, the state-run insurance company that is the single biggest domestic investor in the markets today just [tendered](http://www.firstpost.com/business/lic-chairman-s-k-roy-another-upa-appointee-resigns-before-his-5-year-term-2851360.html) his resignation as well. Roy was appointed for a 5-year term under the Manmohan Singh government. His term still has 2 years remaining but he’s calling it quits now. Can you guess the name of someone else who was also appointed under the Singh government and who also recently surprised everyone by the news of his exit? Alright, alright.. I’m sorry, I’ll move on. And now for some international resignations. Nikesh Arora, celebrity investor and ex-Google exec who was being groomed to be the next CEO of SoftBank also [resigned](http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-can-t-be-ceo-in-waiting-softbank-s-nikesh-arora-explains-sudden-resignation-2226223) after they told him that founder and current CEO, Masayoshi wanted to be CEO for 5-10 more years. Kids these days, I tell you, so impatient. 48-year-old Nikesh Arora is currently busy coming to terms with the fact that he just left behind a pay package of $73 million a year.

**A ménage à trois**

A merger is when two or more companies come together to become one. Usually, mergers that are in the news refer to just two companies coming together. The *or more* part is rarely invoked. But this time, we have a rare case of merger with HDFC Life, Max Life Insurance and Max Financial Services [going](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/MJ5YsT8RS330FJhTDYJJZM/Boards-of-HDFC-Standard-Life-Max-Financial-to-meet-to-discu.html) for a threesome of mergers. Here’s how it’ll work: Max Life Insurance, the fourth-largest private insurer, will merge with parent company, Max Financial Services which will then merge with HDFC Life, the third-largest private insurer. Together, they will combine to become India’s largest private insurer. Every merger has a story behind it, albeit not always an exciting one, it’s still business and not Dan Brown. But our story begins 13.8 billion years ago with the big bang. We had some dinosaurs. Then some other stuff happened. And then in the late 1990s, India allowed private insurance companies to compete in the market which was dominated by the state-run Life Insurance Corporation. It should’ve spelled bad news for LIC but it still emerged as the winner in the competition as even today, the insurance industry is dominated by LIC. It’s no joke to compete against LIC which sells insurance policies that are basically guaranteed by the government. So you need to join forces and make allies if you want to take on the ring-leader that is LIC. And this three-way merger is only an effort to join forces and make allies.

**Funding For A Fund Of Funds That Funds Startups**

A significant part of this series always ends up being about the government even though it is supposed to be about the economy. Well, that’s because a significant part of our economy is controlled by the government through state-owned corporations and legislative policies. But the government’s influence on the economy is gradually declining because of policies like disinvestment, where the government gradually privatizes state-owned corporations. But sometimes, you just have to invest to spur growth. The government [approved](http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-cm/establishment-of-fund-of-funds-for-funding-support-to-start-ups-116062200723_1.html) a ₹10,000 crore fund that will be managed by the Small Industries Development Bank of India, who will use the money to invest in funds that invest in startups. With this, the government isn’t trying to encourage the creation of Indian Zuckerbergs and Gates’ - it’s trying to encourage the creation of Indian jobs (with the lowercase j). More specifically, the fund is expected to create 18 lakh jobs. 18 lakh jobs? That’s enough to feed 18 lakh poor families. Either that, or about 18 #Urbanpoors.

* The Food Corporation of India is the government-owned company that runs and manages the public distribution system, or what you might know as the ration shops that sell food at cheap prices. It’s the FCI that pays the extra 10 bucks while buying, so that the farmer doesn’t get exploited by having to sell for cheap. Except instead of mangoes, it’s food-grains. The government provides a lot of subsidies through the corporation - so many subsidies that the FCI now owes ₹58,650 crore to others as pending subsidy payments. Which is why it is [inviting](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/agriculture/fci-to-raise-rs-20000-crore-short-term-loan/articleshow/52885209.cms) bids from banks to raise a short term loan of ₹20,000 crore. Oh yeah, because when you’re a government-owned corporation, you don’t go to the banks when you need a loan. The banks come to you.

* After a political campaign that ended with the exit of the RBI Governor, MP Subramanian Swamy is the talk of the town. And now, he has [trained](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/economy/subramanian-swamy-now-targets-cea-arvind-subramanian-after-raghuram-rajan-exit-2868336/) his guns on Chief Economic Advisor to the government, Arvind Subramanian. In a salvo of tweets, Swamy stated that Arvind should be fired immediately. For there can only be one Subramanium.

Business/Finance,Want to shift to India - Finance or Programming?,10,5sed6s,nosleepnomore,14,"I am a 22 year old NRI living in Thailand. I have zero corporate work experience. I have only worked in the family business with my dad. I am a BBA in Finance undergrad. I want to shift to Mumbai. Recently I got introduced to web development, and am really interested in learning it. However, I am interested in Finance too. So, just like webdev, are there online Finance courses I can take to stay updated in Finance, which will make it more likely for me to get a job? Or are there particular programming languages I can take up which will be beneficial in the Finance field? I have lost touch with Finance since I graduated in Dec 2015.

In 2003,  Modi, the chief minister of Gujarat, was taken to task by the Confederation of Indian Industry for the anti-Muslim riots in the state. Leading the charge were prominent industrialists like Rahul Bajaj and Jamshyd Godrej. The CII's attack on Modi provoked an angry reaction by a group of Gujarati industrialists, who organised themselves under the Resurgent Gujarat Group. Adani and Mehta were the leading lights of the RGG, which took on the CII on Modi's behalf. The CII was forced to apologise to the chief minister.

His wealth has more than quadrupled since Modi announced his candidacy in September 2013, the biggest gain among the country’s elite.

The rates at which the Adani Group bagged land from the Narendra Modi-led Gujarat government for its port and special economic zone (SEZ) project — between Re 1 and Rs 32 per square metre — were much lower than other companies that set up units in the state.  Tata Motors was given 1,110 acres for its Nano car plant in Sanand (near Ahmedabad) at Rs 900 per sq mt, Ford India paid at Rs 1,100 per sq mt for 460 acres close by, while India’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki, bought about 700 acres in Hansalpur at Rs 670 per sq mt.

Special Economic Zones Rules, 2016, were amended by the department of commerce, to insert a provision on claims for refund under the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005. The SEZ Act under which the SEZ Rules are framed did not initially provide any provision for refunds of any kind before this amendment was introduced. The Adani Power Ltd. has claimed that it has paid customs duty on raw ¬materials and consumables – that is, coal imported for the generation of electricity. However, documents leaked to the EPW clearly indicate that the APL had not, in fact, paid the duty on raw materials and consumables amounting to approximately Rs 1,000 crore that had fallen due at the end of March 2015. It appears at face value that by amending the SEZ Rules to insert a provision for companies to claim refunds on customs duty, the department of commerce is ¬allowing the Adani Power Ltd. to claim refunds on the duty that has never been paid by it in the first place [Source-Wire.in](https://thewire.in/149156/modi-government-adani-group/)

Ironically, the biggest black money case that has come up before the SIT so far is that of the Adani group. The Adani group allegedly took out over Rs 5,000 crore to tax havens, using inflated bills for the import of power equipment from South Korea and China, the SIT on black money was told by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The Adani group vehemently denies any wrongdoing. Modi, after his rhetoric-filled ride to power, has been silent. Since Modi’s ascension to office, what has happened in the ED, which had registered a preliminary case against Adani in Ahmedabad and was handed details of DRI findings, is illustrative. The officer heading the Ahmedabad branch of the directorate was raided by the CBI, which accused him of possessing disproportionate assets. It failed to prove anything at all, despite months of investigation. The two senior-most officers in the Mumbai regional office, who oversaw the investigations in Ahmedabad, were forced out of the agency. The tenure of Rajan S. Katoch, who was heading the directorate when the case was opened, also ended abruptly. Apart from the Adani case, the Ahmedabad ED investigators were also pursuing some of the biggest money launderers of Gujarat.[Source-Wire.in](https://thewire.in/58640/black-money-investigation-a-feast-of-vultures/)",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6omzm2/modi_and_adani_relation_lobbying_and_crony/
Business/Finance,Long post - I hate high interest rates in India.,79,35kmvp,hopesforabetterindia,50,"Long time lurker. Thought I would share some of my rants about India here.
One of the problem with India is extremely high interest rates. When rates are this high (10% compared to 0-2% in many developed countries), cost of doing business is huge.


Consider the following scenarios

1) No one will invest in a business where the return is less than 10% per year. Otherwise, you will just park your money in a bank and earn interest on it. A lot of projects become unviable this way. Setting up big ticket infra projects, green field setups is virtually Impossible without government financial assistance, tax breaks.

2) Property bubble - A 20lakh loan financed at 10% rate for 20 years costs us nearly 50 lakhs including interest payments. So, even if your property prices increase by 150% in 20 years, a CAGR of 5%, you are losing money.

If you include your cost of money, You would have been better off investing those 50 lakhs in a recurring deposit instead of giving EMI. The RD will bring close to 70 lakhs. So a property price appreciation of (70-20/20) 250% or 6.8% CAGR is break even for your money. [I have oversimplified the calculation by not including rent saved, HRA etc]
Compare this to western countries, where property prices hardly rise by 0-2% y/y.

3) Polluting Truck menace - It is taking truck operators 10+ years to breakeven cost on a ageing financed truck. A truck operator will look for more than 10% annual return in order to make money on his investment. To save some more money, they cut corners and are also overloaded producing even more pollution. Read about recent NGT order banning 10+ yrs diesel vehicles.

4) Currency depreciation – Economics 101. A high interest rate depreciates your currency every year. Currency depreciation raises prices of fuels, coal, gas, important imports.

5) Trickle down effect – A lot of goods/ services which change many hands before reaching you becomes expensive, as every middle man would want to earn more than 10% on money invested. Think, cost of fruit/ vegetables you pay vs what a poor farmer receives. Think, petrol pump business, where a dealer has a commission of Rs 2+ for every litre of petrol sold.  

6) Trade deficit with China – Ever wondered why , it is so cheap to produce things in China. One of the reason is low cost of money there. We import every type of shit from China. Things we could have made right here in India.

7) Fiscal deficit from Gold – Stupid Indians keep buying gold thinking that the gold will appreciate like it did in the last  decade. We are the 2nd largest consumer of gold. In reality, the gold prices in $ are at a 5 yr low. But in India, prices have only risen. Do you know why? Hint – 40% currency depreciation..

If USD/INR was at 45 today, gold would only be worth 15k for 10gm.


I could go on and on but would now be interested in hearing your opinion.


Update1. Some of you have said that interest rates are right where they need to be. And that is 100% true. I should have been more clear while wording my rant.
It's just that - I hope for a India which has low interest rates. Obviously its not possible in near future

Business/Finance,WTF is Demonetisation - Part II,13,5fpo2v,modiusoperandi,11,"What is Participatory Note?
Participatory notes are not mere instruments used by Pakistan to invest in our economy. Modi says he goes to a lot of foreign countries  to bring in Foreign Investment.

Out of such Foreign Investments, the highest a country has invested is not US or the UK or France or Germany or any other major country but a tiny island called Mauritius. 

A small Island off Indian Ocean whose total population would be about 12 L! Mauritius has invested more than 40% in India. 

Many other such islands like Cayman islands etc exist. How did such islands get such huge money to invest in India and who exactly are those people? Whose money is it anyways? 

That money is none other than the illegal stash of the Indian crony capitalists! The money starts from India and goes on a sight seeing trip across many countries and finally gets to Mauritius - which then finds its way back to India as Foreign Investment!

If the illegal money that is in circulation in India is Jeevatma, the illegal money circulating around the globe is Paramatma - in the language the BJP folk can understand!

Jeevatma becomes one with the Paramatma, this indian sewer water gets mixed with International sewer waters, then when it comes back to India again via Mauritius, it is the Pure Virgin Ganges water or Foreign Investment - Modi will do snanam and worship it and welcome it with folded hands!

The very same black money that they say they are trying to eradicate, has come back as Foreign Investment, and it gets lots of subsidies when it comes back to India!

So who's taking it away to Foreign countries? How do they take it?Let's for a moment forget TATA, Birla, Ambani, Adani etc, among the fat cats there are individual fat cats like our ministers - yes Ministers! Many of these Ministers who do not even have a  standard education have property in foreign countries, coal, iron ore factories abroad and even whole islands in their names! Some of it has come out in the newspapers too!

People like Adani sell solar electricity to states and these ministers make a huge cut out of it. But do they get bribes in a sack and then carry it abroad? No, they just show a benami name and a property will be bought in that name or money transferred in his HSBC bank! So next this minister or that benami comes back as Foreign Investor!

Many of our ministers go on trips to such islands like Cayman Islands - does Modi not know of this? Will Modi ask all of his ministers to submit their travel itinerary for the period they have been in power for audit? 

Let's take an example: The Central Board of Excise and Customs, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence has given a report - 'a scam involving companies inflating the value of coal imports from Indonesia for their power plants thus siphoning money abroad. Initial estimates by the agency pegged the overvaluation at Rs 29,000 crore in the period 2011-2014.'

How did this scam happen? If we had purchased directly from Indonesia, a tonne of coal cost $50. However, it was handed over to other brokers and middlemen aka crony capitalists to purchase it. Coal is still in Indonesia - but it changes hands to 7-8 different countries on paper alone! So when it comes back to India it costs $87! 

So multiply 37 * 70 for a tonne. It involves states Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal and Kerala! Each state has lost about 1500 Cr due to this scam.

The culprits include state parties and its minister in this along with Adani, Ambani, Ruia, Jindal, India cements etc. Adani has gained 6000 Cr illegally by supplying industrial parts for Gujarat State Electricity Ltd according to Directorate of Revenue Intelligence.

Modi travelled all over India during his election campaign using Adani's Jet. Its behind Adani's money that  Modi was able to fund his political campaign!

He travelled with same Adani to Australia to get him permission for mining rights. Just this Nov 18, Adani was given 6000 cr loan for the same Australia mining project!

Can Directorate of Revenue Intelligence ask why coal sold at $50 was sold at $87 - even if they ask they'll say it is business practice - Standard Operating Procedure! Its perfectly legal and cannot be questioned in court too!

All those companies that changed hands in the process just exist in letter pads! Benami Companies! So DRI cannot do anything about this illegal money and all these companies have understanding with the countries where they are stored - so they wont ask and even if they ask it will fizzle out!

So when the govt itself is supporting this washing of Black Money to White through such routes, where does the question of catching the Black Money arise?

Atleast here coal was bought and 29000 cr lost, but there are examples where such operations have taken place in paper alone!

There is another such Island Bahamas whose population is 3.5L only. In 2008, export from India is $ 22,00,000. In 2010 it grew to $ 280,00,000. What do you think that this 3.5 Lakh people bought from India? What was being exported from India? Two companies have done it - Reliance & Essar - petroleum has been exported. Even if the 3.5 Lakh people drive around 24*7 and eat drink and shit petrol, they can't possibly use such a huge amount of petrol as was being exported! So there you go!

This was not just carried out by Ambani's but by Reddy brothers - who swallowed the Bellari, who were powerful to move the state border of karnataka into Andhra! Such efficient people - Sushma Swaraj's disciples! They have exported very high quality iron ore - how much? From the ports the reports says 5000 shiploads have been exported. But Excise has reports only 4000 shiploads. What happened to the remaining 1000 shiploads? Where is the revenue from it? Where has it been invested?

Doesn't Modi know all this?

So Black Money is not something in a hidden box which you can go and collect it and bring it back and deposit Rs. 15,00,000 in everyone's account.  Its about handling black money practices - as we've seen above they've devised ways to make such black money laudering routes and practices as legal. This incidentally has happened more during BJP rule. No its not a biased statement.

According to World Bank report during the period 1998 - 2004, it was during the vajpayee rule that such black money practices and black money has flourished to the maximum extent in India. Now you can understand why the news came in today about BJP leading the parties in income from unknown sources. 

In 2011, after scams such as 2G etc started surfacing, Advani started a Rath Yathra against Corruption and Black Money, saying there are 70 Lakh Crores of Black Money stashed abroad, I'll bring it back"". Advani was held up as the iron Man - Lauh Purush - as if he'll act like a superman bomb all illegal stashes abroad and bring all black money back but he was bombed by Modi in 2014 who took over his role and got involved with Anna Hazare etc and personally making gullible statements to fool people about 15 L for each account.

However, during UPA rule, in a very important case for Black money, the tax evasion case by Vodafone, the SC ruled that we cannot demand such tax from them. After that, when Pranab Mukherjee brought in rules to avoid such malpractices namely, GAAR - General Anti Avoidance Rules, the person who spoke vociferously against it and did not allow it was none other than our present FM Arun Jaitlee! Not just FM but all the corporates and crony capitalists were against bringing in this rule!

During UPA rule, the BJP asked Congress to bring out names of Swiss Bank holders in Parliament. Pranab Mukherjee ridiculed them in Parliament. Swiss Banks are not giving out names, shall we send the Army? BJP kept quiet and then turned it as if Congress is not giving out names. Today, when BJP is in power, Modi is giving the same answer to SC!

Now, BJP is not keen about money stashed abroad. So they turned their attention towards internal black money (Jeevatma, remember?) So doesn't Modi know who are the kingpins involved? Ok if you don't know who can find it out - Income Tax, Enforcement directorate, Revenue Intelligence, CBI, Finance Ministry are at his disposal! So what are those departments doing?

Either they are in the payrolls of such kingpins or you all have decided not to act on them. So this whole system is nothing but a farce!

So now Modi is trying to bring Black Money out of ordinary people - who have never seen such huge amount of money as quoted in this post - let alone black money! Modi has brought in an emergency situation and panicked the people. Just before this demonetisation, Modi met and discussed with 3 chiefs of Army Navy & Airforce. Why? Because, he feared a civil unrest and wanted to avoid it. This Army has not been sent against the kingpins of black money but if the ordinary people are put to much hardships they know it will lead to outcry and want to avoid it and have taken measures for that.

After doing all this, the BJP representatives when asked if by removing 500 & 1000 notes will BM be curbed, on talk shows they are saying ""We never said anything like that. This is a step towards curbing black money.""

So why such a drastic measure has been thrust on the common man? There's a reason for their activity. Its not about Black Money or Fake Money but totally irrelevant to it!

**Mergers and Acquisitions**

Business/Finance,"SOS from mother India: Muslim But Fan Of India, Right now i don't know whom to support do anyone have solution?",4,7bkc38,khwajanawaz,4,"Hi
Am just a normal internet user from some city of India and have been touring out in many different countries from last few years.

I really love my nation and while travelling I found that we have everything what other so called developed countries have than why are we still developing?

I generally came up with few more questions while browsing through so many social networking and news channels and other print media.

I Have 1 general question from all the citizens of this country, Don't you think that the only problem is we are been fooled by few politicians?

Why I came up with this question.
I don't think all other countries with such huge population are safest for women's or they don't have any crime happening or there are no bankrupt or jobless people roaming around, every country has this and this is just a part of it.

What makes difference.
Some countries have low population and so they have managed to have better law and low rate of law breakers, some countries are so open for sex and everything that they don't have sex taboo guys roaming around to harm girls, some countries high rate of literacy and there are huge tax payers and the government is so rich that in very average amount of tax also they manage to serve the best to country and there are some countries which has huge population but they work strictly on business and make more and more vacancies to leave less unemployment in the country.

Now what this country is working on?
I found that none of the political parties are actually trying to solve the issue or jobs and tax payers and if some think of trying it out (not only now but even when congress tried few better step) the oppositions and others just try to criticize them and they try best to fool people and get rid of this solutions and try to misguide the citizens of our country.

Root cause,
No political party is trying for the best awareness and is opened up for space for public voice.

Reason:
Everyone is scared of loosing there position.

I don't say demonetization is right or wrong i am just a common man who has not studied finance or i do not know how gst is effecting people because i was not a trader or so, but i know only one thing that if stop criticizing everything and work together for benefit even for next one 3-4 years i think this country would be most powerful and most dominating in the world in ever space.

With all this criticism, blame game, dirty politics we are not heading towards any solution we are in a loop of destruction we will always be behind few other countries and we will always be developing country because the condition of been developed country keeps varying every generation with the high end techs and literacy.

We need to work together for awareness, jobs, tax payers and food quality rather then seeing who is low level scammer or who is shouting higher.

Please be aware we are not moving towards development if this situation is continued and maximum people stay against government always.

I pardon for my language if i have misspelled or there is a grammatical issues, I am not a blog writer but i am really in pain with the way things are going and if we all don't stand to support any government in position all together we will always be in the same situation forever, and i think this is the right time to open eyes and start supporting because we need a government with majority and this is that government lets support them maximum and give a try we have no other option when you have to bare it anyways why not supporting while voting again don't vote them thats all.

Business/Finance,Last Week in Parliament (July 18 to July 22),46,4uhxod,kumbhakaran,8,"Hello /r/India,

I return with another four weeks of fun and frolic at the expense of our elected leaders in Parliament!

Last week, a shiny new cabinet was sworn in, a spirited discussion on Kashmir crisis (and TN Fishermen and Bangladeshi infiltrators) happened, an unknown rule was invoked unknowingly and shot down promptly and many legislations were passed.
Let’s get right into it!

___
#Shiny new Cabinet sworn in
___

Apart from the [53 new members](http://164.100.47.5/Newmembers/partymemberlist.aspx) that were sworn into Rajya Sabha, PM Modi introduced his new ministers to both houses. Prakash Javadekar replaced Smriti Irani as Minister of Human Resource Development, Vijay Goyal was given Ministry of State (Independent Charge) for Youth Affairs & Sports and Anil Madhav Dave was sworn in as the new Minister of State (Independent charge) of Environment forest and Climate Change. A whole host of new Ministers of State were also sworn in. 

I know what you’re thinking.
 
*What’s the difference between a Cabinet Minister, Minister of State (Independent Charge) and Minister of State?* 

**Cabinet Minister**: Person is given full control over a Ministry and is eligible to attend cabinet meetings (which is the highest decision-making body of the country).

**Minister of State (Independent Charge)**: Person is given charge over a ministry, but the PMO keeps a close watch on how the ministry is functioning. These ministers are allowed to attend cabinet meetings only if the PM’s permits them to do so.

**Minister of State**: Person is given charge of a specific department or just a part of a Ministry, especially when the Ministry is large (Eg: Home, Defence or Finance). The Cabinet Minister has complete authority to decide what tasks are to be given to the MoS within the Ministry. MoS cannot attend cabinet meetings.

Casual Observation: Out of all those who were sworn in, Arjun Ram Meghwal seemed to have gotten the loudest thumps and cheers. He used to be the Chief Whip of BJP in Lok Sabha and has now been made MoS of Finance. 
Seems like he won’t be able to [bicycle to Parliament anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxyz8YASYHk).

Bonus: Here’s the [mother of all government directories](http://goidirectory.nic.in/union_categories.php?ct=E002), in case you want to find out how to reach ministries. This includes state ministries and PSUs as well. Explore away!

#Kashmir Crisis… Bangladeshi Infiltration and Tamil Fishermen
___
Discussions were held in both houses of Parliament regarding the ongoing agitation happening in the Kashmir Valley. While accusations flew thick between the Congress and BJP, regional parties like AIADMK and TMC decided to bring in their own international border issues into the discussion.

Kalyan Banerjee from TMC started speaking about infiltration from Bangladesh to West Bengal when he was interrupted by Ananth Kumar, Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers. He pointed out the Mr Banerjee was going off topic. 

[Then this happened](http://imgur.com/lWsluww)

You're killin it Khargeji!

AIADMK’s A Anwar Raajhaa (With the kind blessings of [Puruchithalaiva Amma](http://mythicalindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/weird_jayalalitha_fans.jpg)) spoke about Kashmir and then switched to talk about the problem of fishermen in Tamil Nadu who are being harassed by the Sri Lankan Navy.

#Parliament resumes, Lok Sabha Adjourns
___
The Parliament was summoned on July 18 for the monsoon session and the news was splattered with headlines like “Parliament resumes, Lok Sabha adjourns”. 

Everyone was like, “What?! Why do these politicians keep disrupting the house? Why don’t these people want to work?” 

Well, they do, but they couldn’t help it this time round.

The adjournment wasn’t because of disruptions, which is usually the cause, but for paying respects to a sitting member of Parliament who passed away. Mr Dalpat Singh Parasate of Shahdol constituency in Madhya Pradesh passed away on June 1 (#RIP). 

It’s a followed practice that in case of the death of a sitting member, Parliament will not transact any business on the first day of sitting as a mark of respect. In case an MP dies while the Parliament is in session, the house is adjourned for the following day. In the Budget session, Mr PA Sangma passed away and a similar adjournment followed. His son Conrad Sangma now occupies his seat of Tura (Meghalaya). 

The first order of business for this session in Lok Sabha was [his swearing in](http://imgur.com/vgFFwdH).

Interestingly enough, Rajya Sabha has decided in May 2016 to [curtail this practice](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rajya-sabha-not-to-adjourn-for-day-if-sitting-member-dies-in-intersession-period/article8672837.ece) if the Member of Parliament passes in the interim period. The upper house will now only adjourn if an MP dies during sessions. Lok Sabha sticks to its ol’ ways.

#Thou Shalt not read out Speeches
___

While giving his speech on the Kashmir crisis, A Anwar Raajhaa of the AIADMK happened to just read it out from a few sheets of paper. He even mixed up the sheets in the middle and went off course a few times. 

Rao Indrajit Singh, MoS of Urban Development, took strong offence and got up to object. He asked the chair to stop him because there is a rule against reading out speeches in the Parliament. Well, he goofed up a little though. The person in the chair was Deputy Speaker Dr M Thambidurai. He’s from the AIADMK.

Thambidurai seemed visibly upset that the chair was being questioned and asked Singh to sit down. Although a lot of the conversation was not put on record, witnesses of LSTV will vouch about the use of the word “he’s speaking nonsense” being thrown around rather loudly. At one point, Mr Singh seemed to have given out the impression to the Deputy Speaker that he was being partial towards his own party member. The otherwise calm and gentle Thambidurai seemed to be visibly upset. 

The funny thing is that this is actually a rule. Rule 352 of the [Procedure and Conduct of Business](http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/rules/rules.html) says: 

> “A member while speaking shall not…. (xi) read a written speech except with the previous permission of the Chair.” 

So in this case, there was no clarity whether or not the prior permission of the chair was taken. If only Mr Rao Indrajit Singh quoted the rule number, he might have been able to achieve his objective. 

Mods, pliss to tweet the correct rule to him?

Business/Finance,Text of Press Release by ministry of Finsnce from last year's Demonitization,25,7bgxml,viksi,1,"Press Information Bureau 

Government of India

Ministry of Finance

08-November-2016 09:14 IST

With a view to curb financing of terrorism through the proceeds of Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) and use of such funds for subversive activities, and for eliminating Black Money ,Government decides to cancel the legal tender character of the High Denomination bank notes of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 from the expiry of the 8th November, 2016. 




            With a view to curb financing of terrorism through the proceeds of Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) and use of such funds for subversive activities such as espionage, smuggling of arms, drugs and other contrabands into India, and for eliminating Black Money which casts a long shadow of parallel economy on our real economy, it has been decided to cancel the legal tender character of the High Denomination bank notes of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 denominations issued by RBI till now. This will take effect from the expiry of the 8th November, 2016.
 
2.         Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) in circulation in these denominations are comparatively larger as compared to those in other denominations. For a common person, the fake notes look similar to genuine notes. Use of FICN facilitates financing of terrorism and drug trafficking. Use of high denomination notes for storage of unaccounted wealth has been evident from cash recoveries made by law enforcement agencies from time to time. High denomination notes are known to facilitate generation of black money.In this connection, it may be noted that while the total number of bank notes in circulation rose by 40% between 2011 and 2016, the increase in number of notes of Rs.500/- denomination was 76% and for Rs.1,000/- denomination was 109% during this period. New Series bank notes of Rs.500/- and Rs.2,000/- denominations will be introduced for circulation from 10th November, 2016. Infusion of Rs.2,000/- bank notes will be monitored and regulated by RBI. Introduction of new series of banknotes which will be distinctly different from the current ones in terms of look, design, size and colour has been planned.
 
3.         The World Bank in July, 2010 estimated the size of the shadow economy for India at 20.7% of the GDP in 1999 and rising to 23.2% in 2007. There are similar estimates made by other Indian and international agencies. A parallel shadow economy corrodes and eats into the vitals of the country’s economy. It generates inflation which adversely affects the poor and the middle classes more than others. It deprives Government of its legitimate revenues which could have been otherwise used for welfare and development activities.

4.         In the last two years, the Government has taken a number of steps to curb the menace of black money in the economy including setting up of a Special Investigation Team (SIT); enacting a law regarding undisclosed foreign income and assets; amending the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement between India and Mauritius and India and Cyprus; reaching an understanding with Switzerland for getting information on Bank accounts held by Indians with HSBC; encouraging the use of non-cash and digital payments; amending the Benami Transactions Act; and implementing the Income Declaration Scheme 2016. 

5.         In order to implement the above decisions of the Government and keeping in view the need to minimise inconvenience to the public, the following operational guidelines have been issued:-
 
(i)            Old High Denomination Bank Notes may be deposited by individuals/persons into their bank accounts and/or exchanged in bank branches or Issue Offices of RBI till the close of business hours on 30th December, 2016.

(ii)          Old High Denomination Bank Notes of aggregate value of Rs.4,000/- only or below held by a person can be exchanged by him/her at any bank branch or Issue Office of Reserve Bank of India for any denomination of bank notes having legal tender character, provided a Requisition Slip as per format to be specified by RBI is presented with proof of identity and along with the Old High Denomination Bank Notes. Similar facilities will also be made available in Post Offices.

(iii)        The limit of Rs.4,000/- for exchanging Old High Denomination Bank Notes at bank branches or at issue offices of Reserve Bank of India will be reviewed after 15 days and appropriate notification issued, as may be necessary.

(iv)        There will not be any limit on the quantity or value of Old High Denomination Bank Notes to be credited to the account of the tenderer maintained with the bank, where the Old High Denomination Bank Notes are tendered. However, in accounts where compliance with extant Know Your Customer (KYC) norms is not complete, a maximum value of Rs.50,000/- of Old High Denomination Bank Notes can be deposited.

(v)          The equivalent value of the Old High Denomination Bank Notes tendered can be credited to an account maintained by the tenderer at any bank in accordance with standard banking procedure and on production of valid proof of Identity.

(vi)        The equivalent value of the Old High Denomination Bank Notes tendered can be credited to a third party account, provided specific authorisation therefor accorded by the said account holder is presented to the bank, following standard banking procedure and on production of valid proof of Identity of the person actually tendering.

(vii)      Cash withdrawal from a bank account, over the counter will be restricted to Rs.10,000/- subject to an overall limit of Rs. 20,000/- in a week for the first fortnight, i.e., until the end of business hours on November 24, 2016.

(x)          For those who are unable to exchange their Old High Denomination Bank Notes or deposit the same in their bank accounts on or before December 30, 2016, an opportunity will be given to them to do so at specified offices of the RBI on later dates along with necessary documentation as may be specified by the Reserve Bank of India.

(xii)      In addition, all ATMs, Cash Deposit Machines, Cash Recyclers and any other machine used for receipt and payment of cash will remain shut on 9th and 10th November, 2016.

I could not focus properly and I honestly don't have interest in finance field(first two levels of CA were easy for me and this final is like torture to me). I completed IGNOU BCOM(As regular BCOM is not allowed while pursuing CA). I will complete CMA(course like CA but relatively easy) this February. I am interested in technology. I self-learned various things like web development and IOT stuff. I would not get bored doing or experimenting these stuff. 

Are there any good short term courses either related to this stream like CISA (which includes IT+ Audit) or any other different stream altogether. how is business analytics course by [IIDT](http://www.iidt.edu.in/courses.php). I am depressed right now. 

I am worried about switching streams. Here in India people mostly give jobs based on your degree (at least eligibility is considered based on having certain degrees).

Business/Finance,It's time for Indians to invest in Canada,0,7oony4,cashpiles,3,"It's time for Indians to invest in Canada

Jagdish Pathak

There are more than one million Indian-origin immigrants in Canada. But compared to rising number of Indian-origin immigrants, Indian investment has not kept pace in Canada. However, slowly but steadily, Indian investments are trickling into the Canadian economy. Economic stability has become key to Canada's success and is decisive in attracting investors from all over the world to its shores. Investment in Canada is considered a safe haven for investors' hard-earned money and continues to represent a solid foundation for future growth and prosperity. 

Canada is the No. 1 investment destination in the G7 and was ranked 4th in the world as the best country to conduct business over the period 2010-14, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's Business Environment Ranking August 2010 report. 

Indian investors have still been shy about investing in Canada. Most investors from India prefer the UK and Europe as well as the countries of the Middle East, historically. Outside this region, Indian investments are scattered and limited. Canada is a stable, secure nation, and endowed with abundant natural resources. Its currency has always been very stable and its safest borders are with the largest economy of the world. Canada/US relations can be described as the best that any two nations can have. 

Canada ranks 27th in terms of FDI investment in India and its investments are mostly in the development sector. Whereas Indian FDI approved until 2009 in Canada is restricted to $570 million and ranks as the 20th destination of Indian investments. 

Recently, in Windsor, I saw a big hoarding on the road showing the name ""Aditya Birla"" on it. I stopped and looked at it with admiration, thinking, at last, Indian investors have made up their mind to make Canada their destination for good. 

Indian investors should consider Canada and especially the province of Ontario to be the hub of their North American business activities. Ontario has liberal laws, a huge existing infrastructure, and various tax benefits to investors, relatively milder climate, fertile farmlands and, without doubt, some of the best golf courses in the world in your neighborhood. 

People here are well aware of Indian investments in the automotive sector of the UK. During the purchasing phase of the Jaguar and Land Rover deal by Tata, India and its investors were commonly discussed in Ontario bars and restaurants. Ontario is the hub of automotive industries and support services for manufacturing automobiles of big-3: US and Japanese car manufacturers like Honda and Toyota. Southwestern Ontario is a key entry point for US and South American markets. 

Canadians are very knowledgeable about India and its information technology-related successes. India is no longer a nation of beggars and snake- charmers in the minds of a younger generation of Canadian citizens. Growth of the Indian software industry has made a big mark on the Canadian psyche. 

Any investment in Canada will have to be planned over the long term similar to US investors in the past. Canadian oil and energy, forestry, mines and minerals, and gold and diamond resources are some of the best resources for investors to look at. The Canadian higher education system is one of the best in the world and at par with the US, resulting in students from across the globe studying and performing high quality research. 

Investors from India are relatively conservative by nature and prefer to satisfy some critical marks before deciding to invest. Canada is one such country which should be the destination of long-term investors from India. One might look at some of the investments made by Indian investors in the Ontario province and think how much is there on offer in this well-endowed province alone. Investments by Essar group in energy and steel, by Mahindra Satyam and Wipro in the IT sector are a good beginning. However, the quantity of investment is negligible, compared to China, which is making substantial investment in the core sectors of oil and energy, solar and wind power generation and forestry. 

A strategic investment in developed nations like Canada goes with the Indian aspiration of becoming a global power. Indian investors can fulfill such desires in conjunction with the geo-political leadership potential of India.

But this needs to be said in light of todays FM meeting which will used to further bailout these idiots in corporate India who have used public money and in return just done what they have always done - misuse the capital. Not to mention are trying to force Rajan to cut interest rates to save their own ass despite savers siginficantly suffering in the last 3-4 years due to negative real interest reducing India's savings signifcantly and forcing people into risk assets like equities, (which are incidentally now down 13% from the top).

http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNS.ICTR.ZS - Savings % gdp.

China's corporate debt to GDP is around 160% of GDP. 

http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/chinas-corporate-debt-at-160-of-gdp-twice-us-level/articleshow/48141056.cms

India's corporate debt - taking into account private sector lending growth is around 53.8% . (Based on 2014 figures and credit growth).

http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FS.AST.PRVT.GD.ZS

China has 3x the loan as a % of gdp. Yet has 4x lower NPA on its banks balance sheets. And despite that its banks are facing a debt crisis.  It too has implemented a lot of basel 3 norms which started around 2013 (an excuse used by Modi supporters to justify restructuring when in reality India already employs capital adequacy rations which basel 3 is has asked to be implemented by 2018 making the implementation irrelevant). Even if you take into account China's shadow banking industry its still much lower. 

http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FB.AST.NPER.ZS/countries?order=wbapi_data_value_2014+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&sort=asc

The reason I mentioned China is because China's growth most of which has come in the last 15 years going from a 1.7 trillion economy in the year 2000, to a 10 trillion economy was not driven by FDI as most pundits in India would have believe. But by a massive expansion in credit and therefore investment . Something to the tune $40 trillion dollars. This has led to what many believe its a massive credit crisis resulting for mal-investment, and the root cause of the asset bubbles around China. Not to mention the slowdown of economy.

Latest figures show India's NPA's stood at 5.3 percent. 

http://www.livemint.com/Industry/PSkRuIxPOtkZBDECcgTHIK/Allout-efforts-on-to-bring-down-PSU-banks-NPA-Jaitley.html

So what does this tell us? 

1. Massive amount of corruption in lending especially by PSU's.
2. A small percentage of Indians mostly a few big wigs and politically connected people continue to avail loans without any significant collateral, and when they can't pay back these loans the politicians just help the restructure loans.

How times will the tax payers have to bailout these banks? Even if we do bail them out this time which we have. How long before we are at the same place again. People say oh we will implement basel 3.  But let me ask you this, India already implements most of the capital adequacy standards asked for in Basel 3 so what will basel 3 do?

All this is crony capitalism of the highest standard. 

And now with the latest meeting happening today in the finance. The corporate sleazeballs have asked for their NPA's to be restructured under a separate vehicle known as the restructure bank so 'lending can start again'. 

What really needs to be done and will never be done because the corporate 'honchos' which the fiscal hawks that Modi supporters are in awe of, continue to use PSU banks as their own piggy bank. Of course a lack of backlash because of blind supporters means nothing going to change.

In reality whats needs to be done is no restructuring and bailouts but real changes.

1.Privatise all PSU banks.

2. Create a watchdog which is independent like the RBI to oversee lending standards. 

3.Implement stronger lending standard with internetional standards to account for fraud, and international models which banks like JP morgan etc use when they lend.

Again I don't see this happening. Caravan just published an article (on Ruai's but its all the same anyway) which shows how audacious the Adanis' and Ambanis are. And how they constantly just get more and more money every year.  Meanwhile I don't expect Modi supporters to ever go against their dear leader .

So enjoy paying taxes and saving with PSU's only for your money to directed towards crony capitalism.

Business/Finance,Demonetisation and Bike Service,14,5ipl9r,darthcarlo,5,"WARNING! THIS IS DRUNK RANTING. READ AT YOUR OWN PERIL.

It was a cold fucking day. I had to do something I had been putting off for quite some time -- get my bike serviced. I called up the closest service centers to ask if they accept payment by card and I learnt that the nearest service centre that accepts cards was 18 kilometres away. I had to do this nevertheless. As I had said, I had been putting this off forever and I cannot ride her without the service she needs.

So, rode her to that far off service centre and I reached by 13:00. The dude outside noted her number, made a job sheet, and handed out the customer copy to me. He told me that there's a mall nearbly in case I wanted to watch a movie, or I could just wait in the customer lounge. I decided to wait. There was a stupid Govinda movie on the TV -- he was double acting as a cop and his goofy twin. I sat through it. Boredom makes you appreciate the stupidest things. By the time the movie got over, I had checked to see if they had taken my bike in. They hadn't. I was getting impatient. I was getting hungry. I decided to look around for food. I found a place that sold Punjabi sandwiches, whatever the hell those were. I thought I'd pass. I walked further and I found a place cheap and crowded. It was *parathe zabardast parathe*. Crowded is nice. Crowded means you won't have diarrhoea the next morning. So, I walked in and I had a double egg paratha. I was filling as fuck and I paid him with the last 20 rupee note that I had on me.

I walked back to the service centre. They hadn't taken my bike in. That was disheartening. I decided to go and sit in the customer lounge. The aroma of the paratha that my nose had gotten used to made me realise how stinky this ""lounge"" was. It smelt of old unwashed clothes, dandruff, and grease. Anyway, I was sleepy and I dozed off.
I woke up an hour later. My bike hadn't been taken in. I talked to the manager. He said something about a queue. I grumbled and I went back to the customer lounge. I listened to music on my phone for an hour and it was 17:00. Two hours to close shop. A skinny dude finally takes my bike in. I was relieved.

The mechanic asked me if there are any problems. I told him what I had to say. He asked me where I was coming from. I told him.

""Bro, that's far away. Don't you know we have a service centre there?"" he asked.

""Yeah, but they don't accept payment by cards,"" I said.

""Oh, right.""

One of his colleagues walked by.

""Dude, the finance guy called,"" the colleague said. ""We have to wait for November's salary until January, or we have to accept in old notes.""

""I'm not taking old notes *bhencod*,"" he said. ""What if I fail to deposit into my bank account?""

""You've got a point. Yeah,"" said the colleague and he walked away.

""Your bike's sorted,"" the mechanic said. ""They'll clean it. You can make your payment by then.""

I proceeded towards the floor manager and I got my job card. I walked towards the billing counter.

That's when I saw it --  a helpdesk, a distraught girl behind it, and two cops in front of it.

""We hear that this place is accepting and transacting in old notes,"" the fat cop said.

""No, sir. The only old notes we have are from before 9 November 2016,"" the girl said.

""But, we got a call from here saying that your salaries are being disbursed in old notes. DON'T YOU DARE BULLSHIT ME!"" the fat cop bellowed.

The girl, evidently nervous, said, ""Sir, I don't know what you're talking about. We don't accept old notes anymore.""

""Who's phone number is this? We got the call from this number,"" he asked her showing an incoming call on his phone.

""Sir, this number is a common office contact,"" she said, ""Everybody uses it.""

""Okay, so that's how you're gonna play it. I want to see your cashier in two minutes,"" he said.

The cashier was behind his counter and I was having my billing done. I told him that I wanted to pay using my card.

""We're not accepting cards,"" the cashier said.

""Well, I don't have any cash. All I have is my cards,"" I told him.

""Give me five minutes,"" he told me. It looked like he was shitting his pants after the cop asked for the cashier. The cop was then standing beside me and staring intently into the cashier's face.

""Go on. Swipe his card,"" the cop said, ""I can wait for a couple of  minutes.""
 
The swiping machine was in the floor manager's room and the cashier took me along. After the swiping business was done, he said, ""Bro, I can't go back to my cabin and get your invoice. The cops are right there. I'll tell the floor manager to release your bike.""

""Cool, whatever,"" I said.

He talked to the floor manager about my bike. ""The cleaning isn't done yet,"" the floor manager said,""It's gonna take some time.""

I loitered around the shop floor and the customer lounge for some more time and my bike was finally clean. The cashier walked in and handed me my invoice.

""I had to get in there for other customers anyway. Thought I'd give you your invoice,"" he said.

""What happens now?"" I asked him out of curiosity.

""I don't know, bro. *Bhenchod*, these cops probably didn't even get a call from here. Maybe they just want a bribe. One shop a day for them I guess. That girl in reception in new. It's sad that she has to go through this,"" he said. ""Gotta go, man. They are quizzing our GM now, but I have to be there in case they need paperwork.""

""Thank you. Goodbye,"" I said.

""Goodbye,"" I said to the floor manager.

""We're used to shit like this,"" the floor manager said,"" Running a business isn't exactly easy in this shitty city. Goodbye and good night.""

And I came home on my serviced bike, under-dressed for the winter night, shivering in the cold, my hands cold as fuck, thinking of that poor receptionist and the cashier.

tl;dr Went to a service centre to get my bike serviced. Cops hassle them saying that they're transacting in old notes. They say that they're used to this kind of hassling by the cops.

p.s. I'm down quite a bit of Old Monk as I type this.

p.p.s. This shit ain't political. I just wanted to share something I've seen. I just wanted to share how big changes are a pain in the ass for businesses as well.

Business/Finance,Mega Discussion thread: Demands for Grants 2015-16 of Central Government | Parliament Budget Session 2015,44,333ipd,kumbhakaran,17,"Hello /r/india,

I thought it would be an interesting exercise to seek your views about the Demands for Grants for ministries this year. These documents show how much money is being proposed to be allotted for every ministry. *The increase/decrease in the grants indicates the focus areas of this Government.*

[Here is a summary of all demands](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2015-16/eb/dgsum.pdf). It will help you quickly glance through the major figures.

[Another detailed summary which will help you see each demand for departments under the ministries](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2015-16/eb/alldg.pdf)

[Ministry-wise detailed demands can be found here](http://indiabudget.nic.in/dg.asp?pageid=1)

Example of how we can go about discussing this: I found something interesting [here](http://indiabudget.nic.in/ub2015-16/eb/dg30.pdf) with regards to Drinking water and sanitation. The budget for the previous year Rs 12,217 cr, it has been slashed to Rs 6,243 cr.  That's a 48% reduction. I am trying to figure out why is there such a big drop and how it will affect the overall scene of national water resources. 

I must tell you that I am no expert in finance. So perhaps some of you who do work in the area can help me waddle through this massive budget? And in the process, find out what is happening to the ministries that interest you.

If you put up some interesting suggestions, I will include your inputs in the brief I am preparing for MP /u/tathagatasatpathy. 

Session resumes tomorrow and you can follow the budget discussion as it happens. I will alert /r/india regarding that everyday by putting up the [List of Business](http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/Business/listOfBusinessCurrent.aspx) for the next day, so that this can become a daily input seeking session.

Overnight, the Wall Street suffered its biggest intraday decline in history. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended with a loss of about 1,200 points - nearly 4.6 percent. Shares in other Asian markets were also under strong selling pressure, with Japan's Nikkei down about 5 percent. The Sensex fell as much over 1,200 points to 33,482 while Nifty tumbled below 10,300. The rupee also fell to 64.38 against US dollar, as compared to Monday's close of 64.06.""


* The trigger for the latest global selloff is Friday's job data in US, which showed American wages increasing at the fastest pace since 2009. This has raised alarm about higher inflation and with it potentially higher interest rates.

* In anticipation of the faster-than-expected rate hike from the Federal Reserve - the US central bank, bond yields have spiked in the US, undermining the attraction of equities. Higher bond yields are also seen as negative for emerging markets and commodity prices.

A fall in global oil prices is seen as positive for India as the country imports bulk of its requirement.

* Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday attributed the downslide in the local bourses to selloff in global markets. ""It is not due to the Budget or the LTCG (long-term capital gains tax),"" he said.

* Apart from the global selloff, the domestic sentiment has been hit by the Budget announcement of 10 percent tax on long-term capital gains accrued from equity investments, say, analysts. The Sensex fell over 800 points on Friday and over 300 points on Monday.

* The Street would also be closely watching [Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) policy stance](https://www.ndtv.com/business/rbi-seen-taking-tough-stance-on-inflation-in-monetary-policy-review-1808713) tomorrow.

Business/Finance,"Budget 2018: Cryptocurrency is not a legal tender, but government will keep exploring blockchain technology",2,7uije8,KiranKiller,0,"The Narendra Modi government is looking to oust cryptocurrencies from India but has a lot of affection for blockchain. Keeping that in mind no wonder in future Blockchain technology will replace all mediatory authorities from financial transaction & Indians will start to [learn fundamental knowledge of Blockchain technology](https://www.eduonix.com/blockchain-and-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-ethereum-essentials)

The distributed ledger technology is becoming a hot favorite in Asia’s third-largest economy for solidifying information, alerting all stakeholders, and preventing tampering. So much so that, in his budget speech on Feb. 01, finance minister Arun Jaitley announced plans to adopt blockchain technology.

> “The government will explore the use of blockchain technology proactively for ushering in the digital economy,” 

Jaitley said.

Most commonly known as the technology underpinning the likes of bitcoin and Ether (of Ethereum-fame), blockchain is a digitized and decentralized public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. Stripping away the financial application, blockchain is essentially a bookkeeping platform that can be accessed by anybody on the internet but is owned by nobody.

> “Once you have a blockchain, the big spreadsheet in the cloud serves as a record-keeping system that can’t be forged and can’t be reversed,” 

said Nicolas Cary, the co-founder, and president of [Blockchain](https://www.blockchain.com/) (the company, not the technology).

**Eager governments**

Blockchain technology is already making waves in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

The government there is working with Swedish startup ChromaWay to set up a blockchain-based land registry system that allows people to collateralize property, get loans, and invest against that asset. Tracking property ownership using blockchain allows people to circumvent disputes, frauds, and errors, while also lessening the administrative hassle of registrations and title transfers.

Beyond land registries, blockchain can also put an end to other fraud like identity theft. To reduce the chances of getting hacked, a growing concern in India, the web-based platform can manage digital IDs. 

>“Currently, if you sign up or pay for something on the internet, you turn over unencrypted personal info that gets stored all over internet…creating a honeypot that attracts attackers to breach that service,” 

Cary said. 

With blockchain, only encrypted, relevant information will be released whenever necessary.

Recently, the Maharashtra government called upon industry leaders, researchers, and others to devise ways of incorporating blockchain in e-governance operations. 

> “The government is one of the biggest data creators and data consumers. Blockchain will bring in more efficiency, transparency, accountability, and accessibility in data flows,” 

the state’s chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, said at the Maharashtra Technology Summit (MTech) on Jan. 17.

Amid all the talks of curbing cryptocurrencies, India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, still believes that blockchain technology is ripe for adoption. Banks in India are already relying on blockchain to enable overseas transactions, international remittances, and other processes.

The spread of blockchain use in the private sector use of in industries like insurance, healthcare, manufacturing, among others, could also lessen significant burdens that befall the government.

> “Capitalising on the blockchain technology could open new ways of securing peer-to-peer lending transactions, boosting trade finance, fintech and information repository sectors,”

aid Sapan Gupta, the national practice head of banking and finance at law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas.

> “By segregating the use of blockchain from crypto-currencies reflects the government’s intention to use the technology in a gradual and safer manner before it gets into concepts like replacing currencies.”

**Positive side-effects**

Using blockchain to monitor supply chains means the journey of a good can be tracked from sourcing to their sale by collecting information in the secured cloud-based ledger.

For instance, in the food and retail industry, shipments can be tracked and digitally recorded via a blockchain in real time.

> “This can save lives in the event of an outbreak of food-borne illness,” 

Daniele Bianchi, an assistant professor of finance at Warwick Business School, said. 

> “This is obviously helpful both for consumers and the government. Especially in emerging economies whereby the supply chain is typically not easy to track.”

Just like identity theft becomes harder, meddling with critical digital assets—like patient consent records in the healthcare sector or insurance payouts—also becomes less of a concern since no single authority can modify the records. At Bajaj Finserv, the holding company of Bajaj Group’s non-banking financial company (NBFC) and insurance firms, blockchain technology is being used to simplify travel insurance claims. If a flight is delayed, that information comes to the system and the claim amount is automatically generated and paid without the customer having to even file a claim.

There are currently over 40 Indian startups working on blockchain technologies in various industries like finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, and logistics, according to Sangeeta Devni, a programme manager at the IT industry trade body NASSCOM’s 10,000 startups initiative. But real-world applications are still few.

**Still learning**

After interviewing early adopters, both on the customer side and vendor side, consultancy firm Deloitte recognised a slew of deterrents to using blockchain technology (pdf) that exist in the Indian market. From a lack of awareness to a dearth of trustworthy vendor partners to cybersecurity concerns, various challenges persist.

> “The main danger comes from hacking, that is, the innovation of the blockchain brings new type of attacks which are far less understood and much less mitigated as those occurring in conventional database management architectures,” 

Bianchi warned.

Business/Finance,Is everything all right with Indian Railways? No.,4,40wqci,thrownwa,18,"There is this perception that is being created that Indian railways is performing very well under Suresh Prabhu. Some announcements, anecdotes and his own prompt response on twitter are often given as an evidence. But the reality as often is the case is more nuanced than that. Let's see some news from other side of the aisle: 

> [Rail freight volume tumbles in November

> Deceleration in freight volume growth is a continuing saga at the Indian Railways. **Compared with 8.5% growth a year ago, freight volumes fell 4.2% in November this year**. In November 2013, volume grew 3%

> Even passenger volumes have dropped 2.6% 

> Thanks to rate hikes, gross earnings of the Indian Railways till October are 8% higher than the previous year. But they are almost 9% lower than the budget estimates

[Slowing rail freight volume growth points to poor state of economy](http://www.livemint.com/Money/dtcu77hT9hX5n7TgsgUMGL/Slowing-rail-freight-volume-growth-points-to-poor-state-of-e.html)
>
Freight volume growth slows to 2% in June quarter compared with 4% a year ago; In absolute terms, the incremental freight volumes have almost halved

> More than three-fifths of the Railways’ revenues come from freight services. The slowdown is not seen in revenue, thanks to the freight hikes. Goods revenues increased 6.5% in July. In the four months to July, they are up 13.5%. Though revenue growth is encouraging, it is way below the budget estimates. Thankfully, expenses are also rising at a slower-than-estimated pace. But the gap between the budget estimate and the actual amount is not as large as it is in the goods revenues.

> Compared with a year ago, expenditure on construction of new lines and doubling of tracks increased by more than one-third in the first four months of the current fiscal year

[Railway passenger fares may go up
](http://www.thehindu.com/business/railway-passenger-fares-may-go-up/article8082709.ece)

> Passengers may have to pay higher fares following the finance ministry’s recent decision to cut gross budgetary support to railways ministry by Rs.12,000 crore

> For freight, barring coal, the core sector is not so robust with cement, steel and construction sectors performing poorly. We may have to look at the bitter pills of increasing the passenger fares apart from cutting costs.

> Recently, the government had increased Tatkal booking charges by up to 33 per cent for travel in sleeper class, AC-III tier, AC-II tier and executive class.

[Reading between the railway tracks: Turnaround plan and the numbers
](http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/reading-between-the-rly-tracks-turnaround-plan-and-the-numbers/)

> **Most vital signs of a commercial organisation are flashing red.**

> By December-end, the Railways had carried just 8 million tonnes more freight than last year. The Budget idea of carrying 85 million tonnes more by March 31, 2016, again looks difficult to achieve 

>By November, the Railways had spent only 44% of its capital expenditure budget. It has spent only 41% of funds allocated for doubling.

>**Only 28% of the Rs 1,748 crore allocated for works under passenger amenities has been spent so far.**


So we see a picture of Indian railway where it's financial health is in poor state. It is not able to meet the projected revenue and it is not able to get work done as fast as it needs to even when the funds are assured.

Background - Till few years ago, anyone could dream to be in IIMs, even if you have bad marks in school and college. Get a good percentile and if you show great acumen in the interviews, there is a good chance you will get selected. I know of people who scored ~50% in graduation and could get through top IIMs. 

Was the selection process subjective - Yes

Then RTIs came into picture and people started asking for details on selection and objectifying the criteria. I have to mention it here that that the authorities at IIMs have the pleasure of plenty. It is a rejection process than a selection process. So, rather than instituting a better process they added qualification criterion (e.g. Marks in Xth, XIIth, Grad etc) and only if you clear that, you get shortlisted for an interview. So now, in the past few years, students who have performed exceptionally well in academics throughout their life can only dare to apply to IIMs (no pun intended :p).

It is my personal view that when you are creating Business managers, curriculum marks are hardly an indicator. Skills like Relationships, People Management, Creativity, Street smartness are missing in the people who have been academic all their lives. They can be really great as number crunchers and a domain like Finance suits them well. 
Hence in the past few years, b-schools have been creating degree holders, not business managers.

So, I think there are 2 unintended consequences of this - 

1) RTI in spite of being a good tool, ended up making lot of deserving people miss the bus, of course helped by the laziness of the selection authorities.

2) The folks who are smart, are starting up.

Business/Finance,"[R] Conflicts with mom about caste, being women and much more..",10,4j6kni,9_lol,8,"I wanted to post this to r/relationships, but would have taken time explaining all the caste shit, so here I am.

So, I am not a bramhim. I am from OBC who doesn't have any official paper saying that I am OBC because it won't mean much (=no monetary benefits). I am from a well-off family and I won't even need any monetary help/ reservation either. My native place is pretty small.. barely a population of 500-600 peeps. All members of my family are in the upper middle class bracket (how do I know? Well, we went from shopping for groceries for 100-500 rs, to shop for ""aesthetic"" art stuff at Jahangir Art Gallery). 

Shit is about to hit the fan so buckle up!

A month ago, my relative from native place married the woman of his dreams who doesn't belong to our caste. We are all cool with it because he did really love her and so did she and she was almost like my elder sister (I don't have one). Everyone in my family is okay, however, whenever there's talk about their marriage, my mom will always quote ""see? both his (relative's father) kids married to persons from different caste"". And this tone is always so fucking terrible, and what worst that my entire clan only SHOWS to be okay with it which I found out like yesterday.

She(bride) mingles very well with the 14-21 age group in the family. She is 25 I think and my relative is 28, it doesn't matter cause they do seem great and while he has to a stable job, she works at home and runs a beauty salon in nearby city and it's going well. The relative's elder sister (40+) also married a guy outside the caste and she was completely abandoned by her parents, till they realized that she was basically handing all finances. They ""forgave"" her, yet treat as if she no longer has any business in ""her"" family.

WHAT. THE. FUCK. IS. THIS.

Now, what's worst that all the people mentioned above at at least metric (matrix pass? 12th? Idk.) rest are graduated in professional field - medicine, accounting, engineering and everyone lives in a respected society and yet this bag of deepshit!!!

Now, now, as I said I don't have a caste certificate, because my grandpa (dada) was too lazy to care about it. However, my nani got my 2 cousins registered and this blew up the family like fucking Tsar Bomba. My cousins didn't want any affiliation because we all are good in academics and we can pretty much afford the fees for general category. We (as in my cousins and I) think that it's just a disability certificate and that an entire generation hasn't used it (my mom and mamas didn't have it) so we won't use it either. Now, You would say that's good because, well we aren't being asshole, but my family literally wants us (the future gen.) to be one. Yet, these guys will criticize the ""free-loaders"" and your daily WhatsApp shitposting. If irony were indeed a person, it would have like shot itself fucking a billion times. Y U SO STUPID?

Now, as we (the new gen.) are hitting 20s, our parents are like do you like any guy/grill? Hope he/she isn't a bramhin. Don't bring us shame. While, the irony is that we all have family friends who are bramhin - that too Punekars (esp in VilleParle)!! My best friends right from school to college are bramhins. I didn't gave a fuck about it, but have to admit that bramhin make the best fucking amti in the whole universe. Take that mom!! We literraly grew up in a bramhin environment and never have I ever seen this kind of fucked up shit in ANY of my or my cousins' friends family. Like, seriously, bramhins - the ones I have met and grew up with - are the most liberal folks. YOu call them all the names, but they would alwyas stick by you and drown you in their best fucking amti with ghee. Very close knitted and very very open minded. 

Now, the guy I have been with is a bramhin and my mom knows this. She is too prude to ask me about him so she just checks my phone bill to see whom I call the most. 

OTOH, my man's mom has called me many times and we talk like 2-3 times a week, and damn she is a fucking marshmallow. I am gonna steal her if I don;t get to marry my man. She is like the most humble, yet funny mom anyone could ever have. She doesn't know shit about FB and as my man works and I am still pursuing masters, I help her with it and god, she is amazing! All his cousins and elder than us and some even have kids. I haven;t met all of them, but they too, do know about us and tease my man. Lol, he blushes more than I do :p Many of his cousins have married out of caste (I asked him out of curiosity once), but no one is really interested in gossips as long as they are happy. Only this one guy had 498A misused against him, so his clan has been a little susceptible since, but that's about it. Every lady cousin of his went to a even warm home and all his ""vahinis"" are super close and cool. Yes, they still live in a Wada. 20+ folks under one roof!! 

My parents have been separated since my birth. Later, she had a fling with this guy who abused me, but she didn;t care. I grew out of it thanks to my hostel counselor and later, this guy I met - fucking love him he is my best friend!

I am almost like a family member to his little family of three. But, my mom won;t say anything about it at all. It's like, she doesn;t care or it's breaking her heart to see me go away, whatever. his mom always ask me how was my days and we regularly chat (I am in mumbai and he and his family is in Pune). I even taught her Skype. This is like, the sunshine I want and on the other hand, my own folks are deep in the darkness like caste, shaming and shit.

Holy shit. It's 2016. Why do I even have to care about it? Aren;t we (my clan) educated? These folks will go on and on with their ultra right wing shit and India needs discipline (like dictator ship) and reservations should be abolished and shit and yet behave like living in 1600s mindset (whatever that means!).

Now, recently, my mom has got really passive aggressive about how being a women is about having family, children and stuff. 

To top it off, this is what she said when we had a talk about children.

I was telling how a painful past of a child fucks up the puberty ago/ teenage hood, to which she just said, it's the choice of parents to bring a child in this world. God has given me you so I get to choose what to do with you. To which I said, but a child is a human too, he has rights as well. To which she said, no. All children are gift of god and only parents will decide for them.  

NO. YOU HAVE SEX TO HAVE BABIES. HOLY SHIT. WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL ME THAT WE ARE NOT HAVING THIS TALK????? 

Where do I go from here? I can't move out and she is like turning into some batshit fucking crazy person. She did everything on her own, bought a home, a car, raised me (in hostels though), manages all finances of her own and mine and now, she is hitting 50s and this shit has started. She goes like, now you'll be gone (married) and then who will look after her as she doens;t even have a son and shit like that. 

I am losing my shit. and this IS NOT a shitpost. 

**TL;DR** conflicts with mo as to different opinions.. things have changed, but mindset hasn't.. All of a sudden, caste and caste shaming is getting attention in family even though we were pretty much general category.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4j6kni/r_conflicts_with_mom_about_caste_being_women_and/
Business/Finance,Fuck my life. [NP],8,6cmd0n,harit_panda,2,"I'm a 21 year old guy and I have just finished my B.Com honours and I'm looking to do post graduation in economics (MA, MSc or PG diploma). But my grades are pretty low and am pretty sure my CGPA will be low when my my final results come out. I have also flunked in few subjects in my 5th sem for which I am busy giving re-exams so I'm not able to focus on admissions and before I realised the last date for admission has already passed for most of the colleges across India. The only hopes I have are with MS university Baroda (where I did my B.Com Honours) where I am sure to get admission but it's not very reputable. Or Indian School of Business and Finance Delhi where the admissions are still open. But the problem with ISBF is that they are only offering PG diploma courses (1 year courses) and the fees are expensive af (2.5k admission fee and 5.1 lakh annual fee for just one year). Also there is a lot of competition for admission and I have to give an entrance test and personal interview. My options seem to be shrinking by the minute and I don't know what to do. My parents are dead against me taking a year's gap and bugging me night and day for flunking in my 5th sem exam. What I need is genuine advice and a little support, something am not getting at all.

Business/Finance,How BJP is ensuring their monotony in Indian politics and stay in power,0,61l7in,memwa,7,"There are many polices initiated by NDA after they came to power. 
For example,
* Financial inclusion
* The Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets (Imposition of Tax) Bill, 2015
* Direct subsidies
* Aadhaar
* Demonetization
* Recent financial bill etc

When we take a closer look at these policies, we can see a certain pattern of corruption and dirty politics in them.

For example, **the electoral Bonds** ( http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/explaining-electoral-bonds-in-india/article9524904.ece) . This is a policy to increase the fund of the BJP and its allies. Now, people can buy this bonds and fund parties anomalously. While the identity of the donor is captured, it is not revealed to the party or public. So transparency is not enhanced for the voter. 

No doubt, The denomination has removed dirty money from the market. Now, political parties do not have access to hoarded money to fund their election just like before. In a country like India, where a good part of population is ready to sell their vote for money due to their ignorance or lack of knowledge, this is a big blow to opposing parties like congress. 

The Aadhaar became a surveillance tool for the govt. The NDA govt had amended the 2010 Aadhaar act with some scary stuff last year. Source : https://thewire.in/118655/hello-aadhaar-goodbye-privacy/

Now there are 22 mandatory notification for **voluntary** Aadhaar in this year.  Source : https://thewire.in/115125/aadhaar-timeline-mandatory-notifications/

The recent financial bill gave more (read ultimate) power to tax wing. They can inspect and seize anything they want, wherever they want and whenever they want now. 

You may ask all this are good, right? 

Maybe not. 

For example,take the example of The Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets (Imposition of Tax) Bill, 2015 . The penalty for nondisclosure of foreign income or assets would be equal to three times the amount of tax payable, in addition to tax payable at 30%. But if you want to get out of the hook, buy an electoral bond and bribe the party in position. The govt has guaranteed the anonymity of the donor. Sure, the issuing bank has the data of the buyer, but since all national banks are coming under a single roof under government, the promise of anonymity and receiver not knowing about the name of donor, the banks, donor and parties are safe in the bribing process. 

And, if someone want to protest against all these, be careful , you are naked in front of the govt. All your data, your financial, assets, tele identity, everything is there in front of them. What they have to do is just pull a bizarre thing like porn, torrent downloads etc into paper and screw you. Or they can seek the help of the funded medias and shame you in front of public. 

The govt. has already said that privacy is not a fundamental rights. We are losing our faith in judiciary anyway. Here is more info on mass surveillance in India. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance_in_India 

Oh, did I forgot to tell you that babus can no longer speak against the govt? http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rules-framed-civil-servants-not-allowed-to-criticise-govt-on-social-media/story-FVEtcWbAvsM7NjmPgPqgQK.html 

India is soon going to be like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrium_(film) . Opposition and the elite can do nothing because they have to hide their own arse. When the lion feed on wolves, the wolves should feed on chickens. 

If you think that **if you are good all is good** , it is time to think again. We all are not ""good"" in every eyes.

Business/Finance,Defence Wrap - Week of 14-19 March 2017,9,61m3bn,indiandefenceforum,2,"**Challenges ahead of the new Defense Minister**

* Mr. Manohar Parrikar stepped down as the Defense Minister on Mar‐13 to be sworn‐in as the Goa CM on Mar‐14. Same day Finance Minister Mr. Arun Jaitley took additional charge of the Defense Ministry.

* Rumor mills even indicate that this is a stop‐gap arrangement and soon we could see a new Defense Minister, as handling 2 key ministries would be very challenging.

* Outgoing Defense Minister resolved issues like, One Rank One Pension (OROP), rolled‐out DPP, 2016 (addressed some of the Defense procurement issues with a view to encourage private sector participation), made policy changes to encourage MSME participation in the sector.

* Policy framework to encourage private sector participation, simplification of procurement procedures were based on recommendations of committee’s set‐up by him.

* However, with new Defense Minister taking the helm of affairs, we sense the key challenge would be to take forward unfinished work by the outgoing Defense minister at the earliest.

* The ‘Make in India’ is yet to kick off, as many private players having heavily invested in the sector are awaiting on the sideways to take on government orders for ships, helicopters and land systems.

* These projects are likely to be awarded under the ‘Strategic Partnership’ policy. For over 12 months, private sector has been asking for the award of such platform projects on competitive basis, whereas government wants to select private company for a long‐term 'guaranteed work' period.

* This difference of opinion has been a long bone of contention between the industry and Defense Ministry. The new Defense Ministry has to address this big issue as private sector has been long waiting with patience.

**OFB to get order for 155mm shells from UAE**

* India had signed Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) with UAE government on Jan 25, 2017. As part of CSP (which includes areas Defense & Security) deals from Air & Naval Defense were expected to be signed sooner.

* Media reports indicate that Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) is close to bagging an order to make 155mm extended bore full range shells of boat‐tail version, which are used in Bofors‐type Artillery guns (with over 35 kms range) for UAE. Once UAE made the proposal to India in last week of Feb‐2017, India signed the agreement and UAE on its part is yet to sign the documents.

* Since the Jan 25, 2017 meeting, following are some of the key agreements signed,

 * Offshore Patrol vessels and Frigates/Corvettes (UAE has been buying them from USA, Europe),

 * supply Interceptor boats developed by L&T & Private players,

 * 100 SPAD guns project to L&T in partnership with Korean company (project to cost ~Rs 9‐10 bn).
 * Also, RDEL signed strategic MoU with Emirates Defense Industries Company (UAE based integrated defense company).

* OFB bagging this project would give major fillip to them as they have been majorly dependent on IA for their orders. OFB makes 2 versions of shells, boat‐tail and base‐bleed versions.

* Boattail version is an older version and OFB has expertise in making indigenously this variant of shell. These shells are likely to be made at OFB’s Nagpur, Chandrapur and Bhandara plants.

* OFB to‐date has exported 50‐odd products (like Brake parachutes for Su30 & MiG‐29 Fighters, 91mm TRA gun for Navy, Small caliber Ammunition, Prahari‐ the 12.7 Air Defense Gun) to countries like Maldives, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, USA and Germany.

* On being awarded this Rs 2.35bn project, OFB’s exports order‐book will zoom‐up 10x (currently exports from OFB are in Rs200‐500mn range).
* We see this development to be very positive, as this is in line with our ex‐Defense Minister’s vision to promote India as Defense export hub. Ex‐Defense Minister had set $2 bn of Defense exports target from India for next 2 years. Growing ties with Mauritius, UAE, Vietnam and Myanmar indicate that Indian Defense eco‐system is working towards achievement of the $2bn Defense exports target.

**Update on Indo‐Russian delegates meet**

* On Mar 17‐18 both, Indian and Russian Defense ministries and corporate representatives met to discuss possibilities of manufacturing spare parts and ammunition for Russian origin Aircraft and Military platforms.
* India and Russia signed 2 Long‐Term Service Agreements (LTSA) for new spares delivery schedule from Russia, a logistics hub in Bangalore and domestic manufacturing of parts by HAL for 200 Su‐30MKI fighter jets, which in future would exceed to 270 Aircrafts. As per agreement, United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) and United Engine Corporation (UEC) will render technical support; provide maintenance services and spares to the fleet for next 5 years worth $300mn.
* The pacts were signed between HAL and the 2 Russian companies. UAC has acquired the right to supply spare parts and do the repair and servicing of the Aircraft it delivered earlier in Dec‐ 2016 only.
* UAC also signed an agreement with HAL to provide lifecycle support and maintenance for Mi‐17 helicopters, MiG‐29K fighter jet, T‐90 tanks and INS Vikramaditya Aircraft Carrier.
* On the sidelines of an event, Russian Trade and Industry Minister, Denis Manturov revealed that M&M subsidiary is working closely in creating the interiors for Sukhoi Super Jet. Russia is negotiating with M&M on MC‐21 Aircraft, a civil aviation project, which is soon to have its maiden flight soon. Also, Russia is negotiating with M&M and other private players to manufacture components for another project 2114 (a Commercial Aircraft project).
* Another Russian official confirmed that an agreement is soon to be finalized for the supply of 60 Multi‐purpose Kazan Helicopters under Phase‐I, whereas, joint facilities would be set up in India to manufacture another 140 helicopters.
* >60% of Indian Defense Equipment platforms procured since 1960’s are of Russian origin. The current serviceability rate of the IAF and IN fleet is <50% owing to lack of spares.
* We view deals between HAL and 2 Russian companies to be big positive, as IAF would now find ease in the procurement of spares from HAL. In 2014, the serviceability rates of Su‐30MKI fighter jets were at 46%. However, post setting‐up the Rs 4 bn after sales service centre for both, Su‐30MKI fighter jets & Helicopters, the serviceability rates have increased to 60%. In other words, it means that of the total fleet size of ~230 Su‐30MKI fighter jets, ~138 of them are ready for missions at any given time.
* MoD some time back had set an ardent task of increasing the serviceability rate to ~75% levels.
* This is in‐line with MoD’s strategy to bring the entire IAF Fighter Jet fleet to global serviceability standard of ~75% levels. This could be gauged from the recent Rafale deal signed, where the French government has promised India, that Rafale will ensure 75% serviceability rate. Also, steep penalties have been imposed if timelines are not adhered.
* We see the 2 agreements between HAL and the Russian companies for technical support; provide maintenance services and spares to the fleet for next 5 years to be in‐line with MoD’s strategy to further improve the serviceability rate of the Su‐30MKI Fighter Jet fleet.
* As a result of this initiative, we expect (1) spares cost (on per unit basis) to decline, and (2) DPSU’s and smaller unlisted players to benefit.
* Also, we see positive development from M&M subsidiaries point of view, as the much awaited uptick in their Aerospace business kick‐in. However, we see some meaningful contribution from the Russian side of Aerospace to be seen from FY2018 onwards only.
* Lastly, proposed JV for manufacture of Kazan Ka‐226T was an inter‐governmental agreement
* Signed in Dec‐2015, between Russian Helicopters, JSC Rosoboronexport & HAL. This agreement
assures localization of the production and supply of 200 Light Multi‐role Ka‐226T over a period
of 9 years. First 60 helicopters of them will be produced in Russia, while the remaining 140
helicopters will be produced in India.
* On a whole, this Indian‐Russian delegates meeting concluded with 2 deals signed and making way for few more in the pipeline.

**Lakshya‐II tested successfully**

* IAF successfully test‐flew the Advanced version of Pilot‐less Target Aircraft (PTA) Lakshya‐II on Mar‐15 from the Integrated Test Range off at Odisha coast.
* During the 30 minute flight, this PTA was made to dive at different altitudes, demonstrate various technologies and subsystems including software correction.
* This PTA has a sub‐sonic and re‐usable aerial target system, is remote controlled from ground and designed to impart training to both air‐borne and air‐defense pilots.
* It’s required to evaluate and develop trials of new surface‐to‐air and air to‐air weapon systems.
The test was carried out to check the validity of its engine and duration enhancement.
* Lakshya‐II is designed and developed by Bangalore‐based Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE), a DRDO lab.

*About Lakshya Project: 
Lakshya is a reclaimable Aerial target system designed to train guns, missile crews, Air defence pilots in order to engage the targets. Powered by gas turbine engines, it is designed to be launched from land or sea through a 0‐length launcher and can be recovered by a dual‐stage parachute system. Lakshya has been designed to be reused for 15 missions.*

* Since its first test in 2012, all tests done to‐date have been successful. Still we expect induction of Lakshya‐II in to IAF would take few more quarters as few more tests are to be done.
* HAL is only company in India currently producing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV’s) like PTA’s.
* To‐date HAL has made 39 of Lakshya‐I at its Aircraft division, Bangalore. Of this, ~23 of them have been inducted in to IAF, IN.
* In Feb‐2015, MoD approved DRDO proposal for transfer of technology (ToT) to L&T for commercial production of Lakshya. For every Lakshya produced and commercially sold, L&T would have to pay royalty to DRDO. L&T and Tata’s have been associated with Lakshya projects since very long time. L&T produced the Launcher for the IA version and Tata’s produced the Launcher for the IAF version.
* We are of view that L&T and DRDO have already worked jointly to build the production model for Lakshya‐II.
* Also, countries like, Israel, Singapore, Malaysia in the past have shown interest to acquire Lakshya. Even though no order has been made to‐date, there exists possibility of exporting Lakshya (with MoD approval).
* On a whole, induction of Lakshya‐II in to Indian Armed Forces would be positive for companies like, HAL, L&T and Tata’s, which have been involved at different stages of manufacturing Lakshya.

**OFB to produce Mango Shells for T‐90 Main Battle Tanks**

* Tecmash, a Rostec group company announced transfer of the main part of equipment needed to OFB for enabling production of Mango Shells for T‐90 tanks in India.
* Tecmash also finished training Indian specialists for the production of Mango shells.
* Mango shells are feathered armor‐piercing projectiles for 125 mm caliber tank guns.
* Production of the shells was launched in the USSR in 1983 and put into service in 1986.
* This development comes in the back‐drop of a contract to supply 66,000 Mango Shells was signed with India in 2014 worth $ 470mn.
* We view this to be positive development as it adds one more feather to OFB’s capabilities to make Mango Shells, which are used by T‐90 Tanks. Given that the final batch of these Mango Shells was delivered recently, we do not see a large ticket awarding for these Mango shells by IA in the next 3‐6 months at least.


**IAF to get 6 new C‐130J S with Terrain Warning System**

* As per solicitation posted by US Air Force on US Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps), IAF is to get 6 new Lockheed Martin C‐130J Hercules Transport Aircraft equipped with Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS). This subscription will run for 40 months starting 31 May‐ 2017 through till 31 Aug‐2020.
* Responses for this solicitation are to be submitted by Mar‐30, 2017.
* IAF currently fields 4 C‐130Js, having ordered 6 of them in 2008 (as 2 of them met accidents).
* These 6 Aircrafts that are being solicited were contracted in Dec‐2013 for $ 1.1 bn.
* As with the current fleet, these Aircraft are to be fitted with defensive aids, Indian‐specific communication systems, and chin‐mounted electro‐optic/infrared (EO/IR) sensor turrets.
* Solicitation to get the new 6 Lockheed Martin C‐130J Hercules Transport Aircraft equipped with Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS) indicates that government is focused to spend on Aircraft safety. TAWS are being deployed globally to prevent the occurrence of any accidents.
* It is after 2 of the C‐130J Hercules got damaged in 2014 & 2017 MoD took the decision to equip TAWS in to these 6 new Military Transport Aircrafts to avoid any further accidents.
* On a whole, we see this to be a positive development for the IAF fleet.

Since so many people called me out for making up shit I will simply quote from articles this time.


Creation of money by the banks

> The Credit Market Funnel

> Suppose the U.S. Treasury prints up $10 billion in new bills, and the Federal Reserve credits an additional $90 billion in readily liquefiable accounts. At first, it might seem like the economy just received a monetary influx of $100 billion, but that is actually only a very small percentage of the actual money creation.
> 
> This is because of the role of banks and other lending institutions that receive new money. Nearly all of that extra $100 billion enters banking reserves. Banks don't just sit on all of that money, even though the Fed now pays them 0.25% interest to just park the money with the Fed Bank. Most of it is loaned out to governments, businesses and private individuals.
> 
> The credit markets have become a funnel for money distribution. **However, in a fractional reserve banking system, new loans actually create even more new money. With a legally required reserve ratio of 10%, the new $100 billion in bank reserves could potentially result in a nominal monetary increase of $1 trillion.**

https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/081415/understanding-how-federal-reserve-creates-money.asp

India uses the same system overall but the multiplier is higher.


> Every one rupee of central bank money in India is able to generate around 6 rupees of money supply in the economy. India’s ratio remains lower than that of Europe, but higher than that of the US.

**NPAs in India**

> Public sector banks (PSBs), which accounted for 90 percent of the total gross NPAs of the banking sector, has seen their gross NPAs jumping past Rs 7 lakh crore in June 2017 quarter. In the past seven quarters, it jumped by Rs 4.18 lakh crore or 133 percent to Rs 7.33 lakh crore in June 2017 quarter from Rs 3.14 lakh crore in September 2015 quarter.

> For example, in the steel sector, Essar Steel and Bhushan Steel have an exposure of close to Rs 1 lakh crore. Other large stressed companies - Jaypee, Lanco, Videocon, and GMR jointly owe over Rs 3 lakh crore to the banking system. Most of them got into non-core activities like real estate which guzzled up the borrowings, resulting in losses and defaults to banks.

> Recently, finance minister Arun Jaitley candidly admitted that the bad loan problem was largely confined to some 50 large corporate groups who had indiscriminately borrowed from banks to set up steel and infrastructure projects, especially in the power sector. **These groups alone would account for over 80% of the total NPAs and stressed assets in the banking system.** Latest data shows that the total NPAs and stressed assets are in the range of Rs 13 lakh crore to Rs 14 lakh crore. **And these are politically, well connected corporate families who dominate election funding.**

> Overall, the story is one of the taxpayer bailing out the banks and defaulting corporate groups whose promoters will still end up laughing all the way to the bank.

Somewhat of an opinion piece but read out of it what you want.


Based on all the quotes above I want to ask a few questions, why did the government still decide to recapitalize using public money? Why isn't divestment of SBI and PSU banks on the table? 

Doesn't pumping more public money mean doing the same mistake all over again? All the NPAs were given to political friends of Congress around 2009 or so. 

Now without substantial changes big loans will be given to political friends of BJP and it is very likely that the loans will become NPAs some 10 years or so from now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7cap05/bank_recapitalization_is_socializing_losses_and/
Business/Finance,"Question you would like to ask Mr.Raghuram Rajan, Governor of RBI",14,2wrfza,sourcex,17,"Hi r/india. I am one of those few lucky people who is getting an opportunity to meet Raghuram Rajan Personally at RBI headquarters in Mumbai. I would like to know any thing specific you would like me to ask him? 
The question can be related to any of 

Please specify the context of your question to get a clarity I shall respond soon.  



  
1. In November 1994, printing of 1 rupee notes was terminated predominantly due to the prohibitive cost of printing. As far as this goes, why does RBI want to put them in circulation again?  


  
If you have any such question then let me know. Will soon update after the meet

EDIT : 
  
Proof that I met him : [Raghuram Rajan's Autograph](http://imgur.com/bE58vPc)

He didn't answer all the questions but some if which he did answered are jotted down 
 
**Regarding PSU Banks**   

He says that large banks i.e the big players didn't want to have regulators for small banks and wanted to avoid that. But He (R_R) believed that they stand an equal chance as them and deserved to compete in the market. They need to be given opportunity to create a business and shape-up the economy.   
He quoted saying "" If they can't compete then don't deserve to exist ""  

**Regarding Bitcoin**  

RBI didn't fail to understand bitcoin, it just alarmed people that its highly volatile. He was quite fascinated by the innovation of bitcoin but at the same time believes that they can't replace the currency as over-regulation might happen anytime with it and you can't control it.   
He cited the example of movie ' GURU ' of how he tried to regulate the business but ended up failing to decide the future of what he was doing.  

*""It's a good innovation and the direction is right but need something more stable, and BITCOIN isn't the answer""*
   
**Regarding how is his communication with FM,PM and other institutes**

He jokingly answer it by telling *'using phone, emails, fax and letter'* but then told that there were certain discontent between them while deciding on policies and public matters of which  some results of the meeting weren't what he wanted.  

**On GST**

Lesser people pay tax-logistics but he believes GST will allow more people to pay the tax and improve efficiency

**His Advice to Youngsters** 

*""Challenge yourself. Don't Do boring stuff. If its interesting, Learn it. Don't be a master in one thing, move to other challenges once you master one thing, that will help you remain down to earth.""*  

**Asked him when he plans to join Quora**   
His reply - *What's Quora?*

I can't right all the things he mentioned but some of them which I felt would give the gist of what he meant is mentioned. 

  
P.S : I ain't from Finance background, I am an engineer. So pardon my finance jargon or something which you didn't understand, please let me know; will try to rectify it for understanding

Business/Finance,How do you deal with tough financial situations in family?,10,3bm6ik,protos02,16,"I hate to discuss this but my family is fucked up in terms of finances. My dad owns one running business and holds properties across about 5-10 Cr, mostly farm lands. 

Elder brother is 33 and college-dropout, has 3 children and has been failing in both business and politics with constant record since past 14 years. He has started over 10 businesses over period of time, all after convincing/pressurizing my father to invest into it and he keeps failing. His failed business ventures have costed family at least 5 Cr loss over period of time. Dad pays for his daily expenses, including his 3 children and wife. Now you may think of kicking out such people out of house if you are young, but you have to understand it's no more practical. He has 3 little kids, and a wife who though supports him but inside regrets marrying this loser but can't even complain since this was their ahaa love-marriage. 

Now I do my little shit and keep my finances separate from them. But that does not help. Elder brother keeps taking money from me ( he's around 10 years elder). And in most cases I'm unable to refuse because I'm still not comfortable telling no to people ( you can call me yes-man), and if I don't give him, and expenses have to be met, so he'll only go to dad's business and take money. So this way sort of I help dad share the burden.

But now I've even started hating dad. He said I should take a FD in his bank because it offers better interest ( it didn't) but then he convinced me, it will help him show good will there and what not and his credit limited would be extended etc etc. Then yesterday was FD maturity day and I'm simply told my money was taken for some equipment at his business. NO FUCKING EXPLANATION and its told like I shouldn't mind it. I didn't react because I know I'm never seeing that money again. If I talk loud, I'll see a sad face as to how he is old and how he supports my elder brother's family etc etc.

Now I'm sitting here raging in anger. How do you guys deal such situations?? I know I should move out so please don't tell me that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3bm6ik/how_do_you_deal_with_tough_financial_situations/
Business/Finance,Irrelevancy of mainstream media for common people,6,3q8yxr,innovator116,17,"Reminded by this talk of former Greek finance minister and economist  ""The media is owned by the 1%, they act for the 1%, are propaganda wings of the 1%. The media do not act for the 99%.""  (https://medium.com/dark-mountain/yanis-varoufakis-in-conversation-with-paul-mason-260fa3539ce3#.cd30682gu) 

Even if the country is burning, world being destroyed the mainstream media will sensationalize and entertaining. Business model for profit and control by business house families or conglomerates will force them. Recently, mainstream media totally ignored a massive rally against TTIP trade agreement in Germany.
Publications blogs, columns, reports still have some value but TV media is useless.

Get news by reddit, twitter lists, blogs like kafila also following some journalists like blogs by punya prasun BAJPAI, ravish kumar. Even Facebook groups provide relevant news that matters. It seems, this time only swaraj abhiyan like movement is providing news about farmers plight.
