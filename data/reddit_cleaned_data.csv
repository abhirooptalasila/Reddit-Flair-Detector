A months back I got job nascent startup working Graphic Designer Tbh I like everything role job I get people appreciate validate respect work I  I complaints regard

Sure new startup arent much coworkers around handful older generation thus almost little none common I also designer department thus things tend get lonely times though Ive plagued loneliness years 

But arent dealbreaker arent reasons I made post first place

The dealbreaker however lies fact I expected show work 7 days 7365 Let alone I used kind person loathed idea 6day working schedule one barely gets anything single day get Sunday

I mean made clear interview I enquired weekends And I understand part food beverage industry company expected operate 247365 due kind industry part of

I thought job previous year selfdiscipline schedule went control thought maybe working 7 days get back old discipline I thought make active less lazy 

And I guess Ive proved wrong simultaneously doubts proved true regards working 7 days

I struggle get early even despite getting sound sleep going bed early I made thread days back I really feel burned struggling get tasks done due able focus concentrate properly I mean I felt burnout mere months I started working

Again I understand kind industry I I dont understand however must I designer well I Marketing Analyst precise helps needs show 7 days I understand production team needing show like well FB industry even Besides production team reside nearby lodging whereas takes 4050 minutes reach office home

I took dayoff today whatsapped boss even telling I need break I struggling tasks past days understood granted

And thus I feeling job much schedule least Which sad I like almost every aspect job designer company I also dont managers supervising micromanaging  I report CEO directly thus I bestowed full control I get do

The timing also fixed Boss seems like kind person knows actually isnt egoistic petty tyrannical way

I honestly dont think I get freedom privilege anywhere else  And pains share post despite perks matter good ideal work someone ultimately needs break I could personal time I crave I dont need wake everyday thought I need go work day 

Sure Sunday I could leave work earlier usual defeats point keeping first place doesnt To show handful hours ample time get whatever work left remaining 6 full days

My fear also resign job I dont think I would get one anywhere else Seeking one three full months prior landing eclipsing parents mother especially I feel tend give typical Boomeresque advice doesnt help infuriates already cruel painful experience man 

I would quit heartbeat mother understanding supportive type Expect emotionally abusive neglectful never never past ever provide support I want even deserve maybe She best neutral worst antagonistic towards shes like Dad sibling

Based feedback I get deep personally I know I bad designer I try put effort And yet I sucking interviews I attended prior Was I fresher I dont want go whole ordeal again

And thus I feel like I stuck I sorry long post wanted let hopes others hear understand predicament I right now

TLDR  Graphic Designer Marketing Analyst actually working almost 3 months Satisfied everything else though need show 7 days week due industry thus gradually taking toll Afraid quitting finding new one fears I wont get Fresher matter competent I might And also fears I wont get perks privileges Ive described post I enjoying",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f9a1i5/confession_kinda_stuck_here/

A days back leaving day debriefing boss noticed looking tired usual really dull tired day told theres anything wrong I told theres nothing wrong insisted Since 3 months since I joined work probation period coming end I told whatever issue I Ill discuss performance review would likely conducted probation got over

But insisted sharing whatever bothering thus I spilled  7 day working schedule much handle I might fit industry note Ive mentioned industry company long run Its food beverage industry I told day week I expect For told fine taking break every week long I dont take Sunday production team start demanding daysoff

I guess kinda reasonable still I find odd theres dayoff default I take one part But thats kinda resolved right Except isnt problem

When inquired longterm goals I told told prior even interview endgame become professor field Humanities psychologist He kinda dismissed desire mine told flatout I professor material I shy reserved socially awkward lacks people skills He told role I right I made due good exemplary I three months seems

He broke detail gave I feel worstcase estimate desire wont work told place age  confused lacking sense direction told earned place due sheer hard work asked data backup claim becoming teacher I told desire purely based intuition told hide behind pretext

Honestly I felt humiliated insulted destroyed conversation This first time someone telling I professor material As based previous interactions classmates friends even teachers almost everyone agreed I took become one But boss highly educated guy tons XP life sitting position sheer hard work dedication implied taking advice I losing great opportunity going path ruining life

I felt patronized entire conversation reeked condescension part I literally could tell anything defense told Ill prove wrong somehow

Tbh I never even told I planning quittingall I said schedule much Ill give months I might call quits He told quit asap case wish invest spend go waste I quit thus hell find another one start entire thing scratch Which understandable fair I never thought perspective

Honestly though I know quitting job emotionally draining intensive I thought would cold formal process nothey patronized guilttripped made feel absolutely terrible worthless

He given two days time come conclusion based I wrote previous post I still stumped loss taking decision based perks privileges I enjoy But whole interaction left bad taste mouth  one patronizes dictates telling I I cannot insult mock belittle desires dreams pretext honest rational practical

Scheduled,Are students Jamia Millia Islamia really interested secularism Evidence points contrary,0,ee2yz1,rahularyarrg,23,"Over past week seen violent protests Citizenship Amendment Act CAA across many states The one probably reported protest Jamia Millia Islamia JMI students News channels like NDTV India Today repeatedly reported police used excessive force “peaceful” protesters We told students opposed omission Muslims CAA sought fight “save” Indian democracy “secularism”

x200B

While going posts social media I came across interesting piece information  JMI reserved 50 seats Muslims Not much faith accuracy social media posts I wanted verify really case Because would clearly show JMI anything secular And I started go official websites wwwjmiacin wwwjmicoein What I learnt research astounded I knew Muslim institutions gave preferential treatment Muslims nonMuslims I never expected bad My article relies solely documents information available two official websites No third parties hearsay All sources links listed end article

  
To begin claim 50 seats JMI reserved Muslims absolutely true The following text taken Page 30 201819 prospectus JMI seen attached image

  
51  
i 30 total number seats Program shall earmarked Muslim applicants  
ii 10 total number seats Program shall earmarked Women applicants Muslims  
iii 10 total number seats Program shall earmarked “Other Backward Classes” OBCs Scheduled Tribes Muslims  
Note If seats remain vacant program amongst 10 total number seats earmarked per 51 ii iii vacant seats shall stand transferred category 51iie Muslim applicants

  
In words 30 seats Muslim applicants  10 Muslim women  10 Muslim OBC If vacant seats Muslim women Muslim OBC category seats would transferred Muslim applicants So would AT LEAST 50 seats Muslims JMI Why I say least 50 Well apart 50 reservation Muslims there’s 5 reservation Persons Disabilities PwD This reservation PwDs limited Muslims since selection students would done JMI staff could opt Muslims PwDs religions And top there’s 5 reservation “Internal Jamia students” ie students Jamia passed qualifying examination X XII Jamia Schools And given 50 reservation policy Muslims exists Jamia schools students category could Muslims So whole could maximum 60 Muslims reserved categories

  
But wait gets lot worse There could far 60 Muslims program  course How Because Muslims also get admissions General category  In words 50 seats reserved Muslims ie Muslims opt seats Of 5 reserved seats PwDs Muslims given preference And 5 reservation internal jamia students would almost certainly Muslims On top would Muslim applicants General category ie Muslims students opt admissions via reservation general category So end percentage Muslim students could way 60

  
To find exact proportion Muslim students one would require list admissions particular program  course I find list admissions year 201920 since lists display registration number students name religion cannot used determine exact number Muslim students However I find list graduated students year 2018 This list mentions name candidates addition registration number Here’s I found

  
a In BTech Computer Engineering 37 62 graduates Muslims ie 59  
b In BTech Electronics Communication Engineering 40 62 graduates Muslims ie 64  
c In BTech Mechanical Engineering 43 65 graduates Muslims ie 66  
d In BTech Civil Engineering 51 65 graduates Muslims ie 78

  
Assuming proportion students admission graduation would moreorless data confirmed suspicions percentage Muslim students various courses would least 60 went show may high 80 I analysed data four streams engineering There several courses I spend time analysing every single one For interested dig deeper relevant links found end article 

  
I looked scholarships ie percentage total number students received scholarships Muslims Alumni Association Jamia Millia Islamia AAJMI tasked providing scholarships JMI students I found list selected candidates current year

  
In first list 325 selected candidates 303 Muslims 93   And second list 96 99 candidates Muslims ie 97 In words students received scholarship 2019 approximately 95 Muslims

  
This data conclusively proves overwhelming majority students JMI Muslims Muslims given preferential treatment I wondered pattern holds true positions deans Heads Department HODs And predictably enough JMI disappoint 

  
Of 37 heads various departments 32 Muslim ie 86 And comes Deans faculties 8 9 Muslim  89  Annual Report 201718

  
Finally I went list Chancellors ViceChancellors JMI By I’m sure guess I would found Of 11 Chancellors since 1920 one nonMuslim And holds true VCs Not one 15 Vice Chancellors since 1920 nonMuslim

  
So end 6080 students 95 scholarship recipients 86 HODs approximately 90 Deans faculties past  present Chancellors  Vice Chancellors JMI Muslims  And yet claim fight secularism 

  
Ask simple questions  
1 How serious students university “secularism”  
2 Should nation pay heed demands given shameless hypocrisy  
3 If indeed strong believers idea secularism wouldn’t start secularising university first  
4 Do students professors university moral right oppose ANY act grounds secularism

  
For unbiased reader article conclusively proves JMI interested secularism least Then protesting CAA In opinion reasons  
1 Supreme Court’s decision favour Ram Mandir Ayodhya  
2 Belief Muslims must loyal fellow Muslims country ie Muslim Ummah Ummat  
3 Rightly  wrongly concluding NRC bad

  
It also interesting leftists  liberals Muslims learnt subtle art appropriating Constitution suit agenda Everybody heard accusation CAA violates Article 14 Indian Constitution One find many Muslims nonMuslims repeating crap It however interesting Muslims demanding equality cite Article 14 justification Well bent upon equality don’t accept demand Universal Civil Code UCC NO You see debate UCC quote Article 25 Constitution gives right practice one’s religion claim various special privileges religious right eg four wives triple talaq etc And discussion pertains giving citizenship nonMuslim minorities neighbouring Islamic countries jump Article 14  In words pick choose suits them

  
So next time meet leftistliberal Muslim says oppose CAA goes Article 14 principle equal treatment ask supports Universal Civil Code If denies gives lengthy nonsensical answer opposes UCC stands exposed  proving  really interested secularism 

  
It amazing channels like NDTV claim present facts never seen fit inform Indians vastly disproportionate number Muslim students JMI Nor call hypocrisy JMI “students” If would whole country would learnt protests nothing “secularism”

  
Now us spread word Please share  forward article truth JMI known everyone

Some important things keep mind first  

1 Your flight ticket shown security outside check counter It printed well shown mobile  Avoid taking screenshot website confirmed ticket Take PDFJPG get via mail site 

2 All domestic flights STRICT 45 min closure check scheduled departure So make sure reach AT LEAST 15 hours flight In case reaching 1 hour  hurt shy 15 mins check closure kindly INFORM personnel flight time Often start call saying FLIGHT TO XYZ area anyone But safe side ask personnel there

3 Airports supposed one best organized places city So expect proper signboards guide you


DO 1 Keep power bank inside handbag stuff like knivesscissorsliquid greater 100ml inside check baggage 

2 Keepyour power bank chargers laptop hand baggage 

3 General weight limit domestic 15 kg check 7 Hand baggage 

4 In doubt ASK personnel airport especially airline booked Like booked Air India something ASK doubt Remember help only



DONT  1 DO NOT PANIC security check It simple You need keep belts chargers wallets watch mobile laptops etc one tray bag tray Dont worry army personnel look scary They fact VERY helpful 

2 Ok common mistake women Your bags Pandora boxes Often women go security check VOILA scissors knives  MULTIPLE 23 bottles coming bag Remember items broken cant taken flight cant anything sharp objects And discard liquid bottle filled js 100ml So kindly CHECK YOUR HAND BAGS BEFORE LEAVING FOR AIRPORT 

3 DO NOT abuse airline members delays fault Remember mostly everything solve problem And cant chances reason  Like coming 40 mins flight check closed Dont guy screams  I KNOW YOUR MANAGERMAALIKOWNERDAD etc 

4 DO NOT worry crash lol Many people travelling first time may scared I dont blame flight crashes always big news

However rest assured chances get car accident HIGHER compared getting flight accident Seriously It THAT safe

I know long time I havent updated happened thereafter I got really busy It wasnt easy raising like human babies 

The journey weaning process

Soon making post afternoon I went pet store got Royal Canin RC Babydog milk The making milk easy add warm water mix according label comes feeding bottle different nipples cats well dogs You use little less powder according preference depending well puppies able tolerate It bad smell bad I wear masks whenever I used feed lol After days I got adjusted smell 

also found babies 1 weeks old mom died night took home

Dont forget milk Theres two options generally available pet stores One RC Babydog milk another one Beapher Lactol doesnt come large packs overall RC cheaper still costly

Bedding For bedding used hot bag lower portion carton big amazon boxes clothing bed sheet top newspapers top Basically created layer dont feel hot bag continue get warm environment The temperature extremely crucial newborn babies arent able generate regulate temperature rely mother The temperature shouldnt much low place hand top bedding heat tolerable place top else add little less hot water next time put clothing box Too much warmth lead hotspots blisters skin 

You keep mind feeding timeline For newborns according breed size pariah dogs medium breeds feed 8 times 24 hours Again break even smaller batches I used feed every 1 2 hours apart Gradually increase gap grow Dont feed much may lead diarrhea Heres chart printed Royal Canins Babydog milk

When comes toilet dont urinate You take cotton boll dip lukewarm water stimulate genitalia make urinate For potty theres option keep newspaper replace see potty The potty watery well  drinking milk If see covered potty take cotton balls clean lukewarm water 

Take care mosquitoes I used keep mosquito coils good knight burning time 

All going well I ran RC Babydog milk I couldnt find local pet stores So I ordered online Amazon Was getting good deal 2kg pack Sadly could arrive two days later 

I contacted vet said give amul spray I didnt like plan cow milk good amount lactose bad dogs Seeing option I give amul spray mixing water 

It went fine two days digestion issues popped Meanwhile RC milk arrived comes saddest part raising 

None able tolerate RC milk reason instantly vomited Being noob continued give RC milk Three went back normal ish one didnt recover We contacted another vet told probably sudden diet change They extremely sensitive stomach sudden change would screw The amul spray used give lactose content probably made stomach bad lactose content maybe werent able tolerate RC milk later Vet told us give less amount powder water

Few days later dog affected worse died  

This incident took toll dogs used vomit lot eating We couldnt find came conclusion probably used drink milk hurry So made changes feeding timeline went small batches inbetween dont become hungry 

The weaning process

1 month later I started weaning process Royal Canin Starter suggested vet I tried first giving nope would smell  wouldnt eat Then I actually read instructions p

According instructions I soaked lukewarm water wait pellets become soft mash make porridge It also bad smell tolerable The smell extremely important thats makes attractive They would gobble food I used give 5 times day Morning 7am  10am  12pm  6pm  9pm 

Yes give rice daal point wont like Its easier feed mashed pellets turned porridge If RC costly Pedigree starter food 

The worst part weaning process nightmares 

After weeks later werent eating porridge Again noob I didnt understand time give solid food teeth grown Also maybe got bored 

I bought Pedigree starter made porridge This time ate like used days later lost interest Thats I found time eat solid foods Also found Im supposed give Royal Canin MediumMaxi Starter Mini Yes brands created different products based size breeds Confusing af 

So anyway I got Maxi starter used eat stopped eating This caused nightmares I sleepless nights thinking arent eating 

Now Royal Canin getting really costly grew I tried Pedigree Pro Starter They liked lot day result wont eat I tried many brands like Purina Hills result everything Luckily found cheap Pedigree milk chicken tasty business usual But another problem started used vomit eating Again found culprit eating fast drinking lot water eating normal pellet diet 

After 1 month In pellets vomiting tried rice daal didnt like first absolutely loved ricecurd amul masti dahi grew started giving veggies eggs also loved 

The schedule veggies like potato carrot pumpkin morning Curd rice lunch daal roti night Eggs day Our family turned completely vegetarian nonveg like meat I know foolish I give Pedigree eggs The diet still till date Dogs actually omnivorous unlike cats

Poops urine everywhere

Youll see finding spot urinating pooping extremely crucial train else youll deal poops floor urines Watch videos potty train better hire trainer We didnt time consequence mine poops everywhere Still untill get trained deal poops Better get cheap toilet paper rolls Amazon Bigbasket Buy brand like Presto Solimo bbhome To clean urines get scotch brite jumper spin mop microfiber clothes soak water Also keep lizol dettol handy clean floor poop

The deworming process

You deworm periodically first vaccination else vaccination get wasted Like humans also tapeworms lot Vet suggested us Drontal puppy You first need weight puppy give 1mlkg body weight 

Now weight puppy Weight first scale substract weight holding puppy scale Drontal puppy suspension liquid comes dropper measure feed puppy 

Be prepared see lot tapeworms coming dogs poop ALWAYS directly apply dettol lizol floor mop time

The vaccinations

After two months post birth date vaccination time Our vet came home vaccinations

 4 months birth  1 month DHPPi booster  Rabies shot

 5 months birth  1 month rabies shot Corona shot 

From second year onwards give DHPPi booster Rabies booster give cororna I feel necessary virus widespread India So two shots total 

Regarding charges doc charged us 2k DHPPi 2k DHPPi booster 17k rabies 18k Corona This total cost three dogs docs charge coming home 


The first bath

Ideally shouldnt give bath weeks past first vaccine shot But use Himalaya Freshcoat You need spray coat dry towel After first vaccine Id suggest wait two weeks give bath lukewarm water Himalaya Erina Coat Cleanser shampoo

Holy mites fleas

If adopting street dog likely come parasites Often comes mom environment You wont notice 1 15 even later days months old Youll probably notice bumps redness poor coating blood Sadly dogs came parasites got affected worst wayhttpsimgurcomaApNnu1n As couldnt bath vaccination use erina fresh coat spray Erina powder Those didnt help flesh wounds We used give Wokazole lotion Himalaya Scavon spray help recover wounds They also itching badly doc gave injections first vaccination costed us ₹600 

Those insects also affected mom Mites spread fast also humans Luckily dont last long human I got redness bumps elbow shoulders time My mom got itching month She take anti histamine 

Its endless battle This issue still present I shower two shampoos bolfo erina coat cleanser every week spot application evey two months Their coat way better 

The fights battles

I got two males one female dog Earlier used eat together grew started fight eating One would eat others food wont let anyone touch plate lol So give food three rooms I still 

My deteriorating health time

 Always consult vet

 For strays check locals approx date birth helps 

 Stock cheap toilet papers cotton balls lizol dettol newspapers You gonna need 

 Always clean floor dettol business arent trained 

 Buy Erina Freshcoat Erina EP powder Use first bath help parasites Also clotrimazole dusting powder rainy seasons Wokazole Plus lotion scavon spray

 Deworm properly carefully 

 If giving amul milk amul spray make sure use little milk powder mix water 

 Pedigree Pro good alternative Royal Canin 

 Fresh veggies foods prioritised pellets If time

 Give treats nice obeyes orders Like hug lot 

 Trim nails frequently

Dont

 Do suddenly change diet young could turn fata casuality Always keep mind transition period mix old food new food gradually increase new food period 

 For newborns ALWAYS check bedding temperature Make sure tolerable high low 

 Milk always Curd good probiotics helps digestion My dog loves amul masti dahi 

 Dont leave much gap meals young dogs  stomach gets much empty theyll might vomit morning anytime 

Was worth it

Scheduled,Pros cons living Hyderabad Feel free add perspectives discuss city better Hyderabad cons department I mentioned,67,d5drp3,lolwhyry,57,"Pros  

 Its affordable anybody 

 Enough uptown cafes clubs anyone explore

 The distances arent nearly far metro cities Travelling entire stretch city shouldnt take longer 2 hours 

 The metro makes connectivity major areas areas landmarks easier The place isnt covered probably Attapur towards Airport 
 
 The airport almost equidistant major residential areas 

 ITCorporate hub Dont say There enough opportunities everybody  Gachibowli HiTech city well developed resident city Im still awe cool corporate buildings everytime I go part town 

 Its relatively safe women especially Keyword  relatively You creeps psychopaths everywhere lesser crimes reported Hyderabad

 Most locals welcoming helpful

 The GHMC Hyderabad traffic police responsible enough act infrastructural shortcomings regular water logging flow traffic They make communication easier WhatsApp numbers apps Its upto outspoken giving information via social media helpline numbers

 You see Hindus Muslims especially living together harmony Temples Masjids literally right next 
Theyre really indifferent whatever political mood center Its good kind indifference You almost never see protests violence name religion city really hallmark communal harmony anyone follow

 Less traffic weekends schedule recreational plans then

Cons 

 Its polluted overpopulated lot traffic said major Indian city

 You haggle lot autos They never follow meter 

 A lack last mile connectivity metro stations short radiuses Makes change plans compromise visiting places walkable metro stations

 Uber Ola autos cancel pay online physical cash 
Uber Ola surge lot ready pay 100 travel 23km  But holds true Indian city particularly Hyderabad 

 RTC buses nightmare Unusable

 It takes trial error know routes worst traffic around times dayduring festivals Traffic Tank Bund diverted festivals religious procession Google maps cant relied upon completely 

 Secunderabad worst traffic I stuck traffic hour reach place 3km away 

 The weather harsh  extremely hot summers cold winters You privileged enough air conditioning survive 45°   summers 
Off late even raining much monsoon months concerning long run

 Lack good colleges universities commerce arts There good private universities colleges non engineering fields The Central University called Osmania University worst redundant curriculums 
Its however slightly better post graduate management education  
 
 I personally want Hyderabad hobbyist events activities terms art literature public speaking etc It good place still woke enough I may It get better 

Summed everything I could think of

Ive living Hyderabad almost 8 years I want move another city grow person gain perspective But Im glad place Hyderabad able fall back whenever I want Its one best livable cities Indian standards",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d5drp3/pros_and_cons_of_living_in_hyderabad_feel_free_to/

Their languages serve confuse  
Their confusion somehow makes sure  
They build fortunes poisoning offspring  
And hand prizes someone patents   cure

Politics,Did Sharad Pawar NCP Congress Shiv Sena defeat BJP Greatest Game Political Chess played India,830,e1yy9u,jasonj2232,125,"After weeks political maneuvering backstabbing drama made television series would rival Game Thrones House Cards talking S8 GoT S6 HoC looks like finally getting clarity happening happened happen Maharashtra

If havent following happened

 The people Maharashtra voted State Elections 21102019
 The primary alliances competing elections NDA made BJP Shiv Sena UPA made NCP Congress
 BJP lost 17 seats Shiv Sena lost 7 Congress gained 2 seats NCP gained 13
 BJP got largest share votes individual party got enough seats form majority government required number seats form government Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha 145
 After results declared Shiv Sena refused form government BJP demands equal share power post CM 25 years met
 The governor member BJP RSS btw 8th 11th November invited BJP Shiv Sena NCP form government prove majority
 After parties either refused failed prove majority Presidents Rule imposed 12th November
 Meanwhile Congress NCP Shiv Sena historically opposed opposed Congress NCP vastly different ideology compared NCP Congress  entered alliance together form government
 Before could form government though Ajit Pawar nephew Sharad Pawar chosen representative broke away NCP along rebel MLAs joined hands BJP form government
 On 23 November 536 AM governor revoked Presidents rule accepted formation BJPAjit PAwar government administering oath office Devendra Fadnavis became CM entered second term  Ajit Pawar became Deputy CM Suspiciously around time corruption charges investigations Ajit Pawar dropped
 The Congress NCP Shiv Sena challenged formation government Supreme Court demanded floor test Sharad Pawar publicly disavowed Ajit Pawar actions
 The Supreme Court directed new government prove majority evening today
 Today unable prove majority Devendra Fadnavis Ajit Pawar resigned new government dissolved

What happening 1942 IST happen

 The Congress NCP Shiv Sena form government Uddhav Thackeray CM
 MLAs three parties Trident Hotel rn elect Uddhav CM
 Ajit Pawar rebel MLAs NCP back NCP Ajit Pawar Deputy CM edit still left seen Ajit Pawars fate process reconciliation seems already started
 The terms power sharing AFAIK still unknown probably Shiv Sena NCP hold CM post 25 years Congress play supporting role three parties sharing equal power

Edit What follows speculation side imo probable might happened

 Now might seem like crazy series events I cant help feel events Shiv Sena entered alliance NCP Congress carefully orchestrated three parties especially Sharad Pawar I believe shown Amit Shah Shah still diaperwearing amateur game Pawar veteran 

Sharad Pawar Co managed to

 Split SenaBJP alliance Although alliance always rocky Pawar Co managed split natural alliance BJP Shiv Sena borne shared Hindutva idealogy simultaneously managing form alliance bitter rivals
 Prevent BJP forming government Now seems super obvious impressive considering fact BJP netted amount votes election
 Exposed hypocrisy BJP BJP always run platform stated party government corrupt unlike opposition multiple huge corruption scandals It one major reasons 2014 Now saga Ajit Pawar lets face never seriously splitting NCP ploy Sharad Pawar managed expose corrupt nature BJP public manner
 Saved Ajit Pawar jail This cherry top Pawar Co possibly stinging thing happen BJP whole saga Pawar managed expose corruption BJP also managed save nephew consequences corruption using enemy deliverertool salvation

Now great dandy Pawar NCP Shiv Sena Congress mean us observers voters Maharashtra Well conclusions I ended whole saga

 DEMOCRACY IS DEAD Im sure voters voted Shiv Sena wanted BJP power voters voted NCP Congress want Shiv Sena power feeling duped betrayed angry rn good reason If ultimately choice population even matter point Democracy What point voting Might well choose next government based better Jenga Monopoly  Sharad Pawar Uddhav Thackeray Devendra Fadnavis Balasaheb Thorat
 INTEGRITY IDEOLOGY AND PRINCIPLES DONT MATTER All matters power Yeah Congress NCP Shiv Sena managed defeat BJP cost All parties involved betrayed core principles ideas upon parties found entering alliance Why even separate parties 
 VOTERS DONT MATTER All 3 parties betrayed trust voters supporters placed meanwhile BJP betrayed trust general public lays institutions figures like Governor supposed neutral

Sharad Pawar Co might managed win greatest game political chess played India rest us common folk lost Regardless political ideology believe party support I hope agree I say entire saga dark period democracy India

Edit We still cant say sure whole Ajit Pawar saga carefully constructed ploy actually betrayed know make rash decisions Sharad Pawar He wasnt present joint press conference parties Uddhav Thackeray announced CM NCP members asked Sharad Pawar ensure Ajit Pawar back fold asap So still unclear I definitely say sure whether intention helped NCPShiv SenaCongress alliance",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e1yy9u/did_sharad_pawar_ncp_congress_and_shiv_sena_just/

 Background

In early February 2020 Internet Mobile Association India launched new Code Self Regulation Online Curated Content Providers Among things sought establish second tier oversight mechanism aegis Digital Content Complaint Council “DCCC” The DCCC constituted manner eerily similar Broadcast Content Complaints Council “BCCC” relevant selfregulatory oversight mechanism television India Notably BCCC accompanying selfregulation code operates parallel statutorily recognised content norms cable television When parallel frameworks subsist likely content creation removal censorship decisions err side caution As know India’s TV ecosystem aligned risk averse space content remains homogeneous quality pales comparison global creative economies

We studied IAMAI’s self regulation framework many problems see respect TV come context well It establishes vague prohibited content norms go beyond constitutional thresholds provisions relevant laws like Information Technology Act 2000 Indian Penal Code 1860 In addition concerned way framework designed exclusionary manner scope applicability DCCC interactions government particular limited actual considerations public’s right free speech expression

We believe likely translate paradigm excessive self censorship plague India’s online content space At broader level believe lead overarching chilling effect mean certain types content get made lead body blow plurality diversity India’s fledgling online content ecosystem Sensing concerns already written IAMAI httpsinternetfreedominonlinevideostreamingandtvarenotthesamesowhyistheiamaitryingtomakeitsoand touted chairperson proposed DCCC former Chief Justice Delhi High Court Justice AP Shahhttpsinternetfreedominagentleopenlettertojusticeapshahontheonlinevideoselfregulatorycode In articulated aforementioned concerns framework

Subsequent developments since reinforce trepidation DCCC IAMAI’s self regulation code To sure Code five signatories developed code conjunction IAMAI opaque manner inputs external stakeholders The exclusionary nature Code magnified fact online curated content space India 35 payers Therefore concerning Indian Government started taking steps formalise industry wide adoption endorse parallel frameworks fuel self censorships

 Latest Developments

The Mortality rate Covid19 Indiahttpseconomictimesindiatimescomnewspoliticsandnationindiascovid19deathratelowerthanmanydevelopednationslikeusukmedicalexpertsarticleshow75084199cms  305 according articlehttpseconomictimesindiatimescomnewspoliticsandnationindiascovid19deathratelowerthanmanydevelopednationslikeusukmedicalexpertsarticleshow75084199cms

The mortality rate US 357 Italy around 12 UK 12according article

so 3 people die per 100 cases India Its scary much

currently mortality rate calculated number death per number cases 

    mortality rate  Total Death  Total cases

currently world 1806436 active cases 111722 deathsthe curve nowhere near flat

mortality rate  1117221806436  618 worldwide

so 6 people die per 100 cases worldwide Its scary still much

lets assume infection ratehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiSpanishflu 20 20 percent population would get infected span 2 yearshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiSpanishflumediaFile1918spanishfluwavesgif 25 infection rate Spanish influenza didnt spread many country covid19 social distancing great three waveshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiSpanishflumediaFile1918spanishfluwavesgif

x200B

now 20 77 billion people 14 billion huge 6 14 billion 84 millionestimated death toll 

realistically infection rate brought 1by social distancing lockdown etc death toll would still 42 million stay fck inside home seriously

x200B

now real panic current mortality rate calculation takes total active cases account people got infected still hospital waiting outcome eventually people either die get cured

Doesnt make sense consider cases outcome mortality rate calculation

    mortality rate  total dead  total discharged curedtotal dead

In case 

current mortality rate  111722  413222111722  213 thats huge numbers worldometerhttpsimgurcomaE2HZnAI

this changes everything

now infection rate 1more likely estimate death toll would 164 millionholy fuck

which makes one worst pandemics history 

In IndiahttpsimgurcomavOkmjyH 

mortality rate  3311080331  2345 high world mean scientists saying low mortality rate

Did gov officials know  know keeping silent cause panic

BTW actions taken Indian gov far best worldas far researched  bring infection rate huge factor

x200B

please help questions

 Am calculation correct miss variable 
 Does India huge asymptomatic cases reported
 How china contain china actually contain lying numbers 
 numbers china nowhere close countries mortality rate second method  calculating outcomes 4 rest world 21 never crossed 5 timevery suspicious Their mortality rate low way country similar curve except china 
 India relying Chinese model containing Virus  India follow Chinese model contain problemi know medical students lazy maths

I wasted lot time But moreover I feel bad behaviour Here things I tried last year I wasted money

1 Bought expensive guitar Thought I learn guitar bought Yamaha F310 I spent month researching guitar buy sites follow learn guitar etc I didnt even practise week Now gathering dust

2 Photography Everyone suggested dont buy expensive camera But I thought photography one Bought expensive Nikon 7 series DSLR Played around month But thats Now I dont even feel like taking photos 

3 Books I dont read books So I thought I start reading develop hobby This interest also peaked thread randia book suggestions I bought books suggested thread close 20 I think Till today I havent moved past first chapter book

4 Drones They craze last year Bought DJI Spark never really used Sold OLX 6 months bearing heavy losses 

5 Online Mooc courses Signed never completed Good thing coursera charges monthly basis cancel anytime want to

6 Drawing  Doodling Thought I try hobby Bought many learning material books sheets pencils etc etc In list prolly least expensive one

7 I guess get gist So I mention things carpentry cooking play station 4 though sold quickly minimal loss bicycle skateboard gym membership home gym equipments arduino electronic kits trekking materials 

all pattern

1 first I find learn something new reddit people trying It could entirely new thing I never heard OR thing I never tried earlier

2 Next I spend insane amount time researching Sometimes goes months eg camera drone etc I try read online every thing Product related user experiences Sometimes I even made notes things

3 I spend money get things required 

4 I try couple days couple weeks Then I completely stop 

5 Post period I dont even feel like thinking learning

5 I feel guilty I avoid encountering things For example stuff hidden kept away cupboard I dont look everyday I avoid whatsapp  telegram related groups like photography groups etc completely 

6 Then I find something new obsess whole thing repeats

It difficult decide life partner within minutes I want know many things including whether keep healthy fit future whether interested accompany weekend trips etc Made parents call ask casual meeting public place They refused allow talks I say yes Pretty conservative probably fear I might reject talk itll shame them

Im gonna hit 30 soon Its considered past marriageable age many So fewer opportunities Also skewed sex ratio Im confused shall I settle like Bojack sayshttpsyoutubecTAi3HWKHQ  take risk look I appreciate advice

My college sucks I’ll graduating year two What What I learn What project I do

Firstly Ill give brief rundown I see IT industry heading next 510 years I think 3 safest areas build career around Android iOS Javascript 

I see mobile OS breaking dominance Android iOS next 10 years  mobile OS wars heading territory Windows OS X desktop So learning JavaAndroid SwiftiOS safe bets I see cross platform toolkits Ionic Xamarin etc expanding beyond niche dont need worry 

For web based apps Javascript always evergreen since impossible browsers change HTMLCSSJS paradigm And even serverside looks like Nodejs web framework written Javascript beat Ruby Rails web framework written Ruby Django web framework written Python eventually However isnt clear wholl win client side framework wars React Vue Angular Some new framework tricky part However client side frameworks fairly simple learning one provide roadmap learning others

My recommendation  pick either Javascript Nodejs  one ReactVueAngular AndroidJava iOSSwift Keep mind though AndroidJava iOSSwift likely popular consumer apps Javascript web apps likely popular business apps Business apps generally quietly make lots lots lots money consumer apps fun work Choose wisely 

Now youve picked one  project Pick hobby  music photography fitness Make something use everyday hobby For example fitness hobby make fitness goal tracking app Divide project different levels progression Level one simple way log workouts Level two adding user profiles see friends workouts Level three adding GPS tracking Level four adding tracking diet And By time go interview project different modules like baby youll able spend hours talking it

Its important pick project app youll build something use Youll never use library management system restaurant order management system point building types apps even though commonly show search app ideas

Insert Story Company Recruitment Being TerribleTime Company Being Terrible Can recommend good companies

This tricky Sometimes especially big companies great terrible time  manager usually sets experience company I cant really recommend I give steps finding ones Firstly subscribe cliches like MNCs  evil crappy work startups  force good exciting work Indian companies  suck crappy US companies  amazing high quality work They plenty well run great MNCs plenty terrible startups well run Indian companies crappy US companies  

Here youll put aside programming skills work social engineering skills First try identify wholl manager Ask interviewers wholl manager selected Try read web blogs Linkedin etc Try see use web stalking skills find exemployees Take coffee beer try get sense feel like manager It might sound like much work better spending year hell counting days get job move nightmare manager

Certifications Yay nay

NAY NAY NAY A HUNDRED TIMES NAY I cant believe still asking question I yet see certification actually helpful The companies seem care certifications ones issue eg Cisco 

Time gap failed papers degree marks low something else negative What do

There little A company ever policy eg hire people without graduate degrees supplies nothing OR policy almost always hire good enough since shortage good CS engineers companies desperate Just make story explain  family could afford medical reasons family emergency etc bit white lies better case brutal honesty I decided play video games semester

Can I work you

I written rant 3 years ago I still recruiting  Unfortunately 2 years ago I decided keep business autopilot mode This meant transiting full time employees short term contractors I little 30  sufficient savings working USA business eventually sell business 12 years I financial urgency work next couple years So I taking easy mostly days trying think new adventures await shitposting Randia  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6vqb73/after_my_rant_on_why_its_hard_to_hire_for_cs/

Photography,Its becoming hardImpossible find good CS jobs India,100,6v9vtx,eskimoFry,42,"But unlike people I willing dedicate resources skills find right fit

Why cant employers same

Edit Some questions I read

Z921 rant another thread here
 You need hobby photography

Who decide hobby worth time Sounds like kind person micromanage employees peoples shoulders like vedhal vikramadithya Also sounds like arewill kind parent like child would like himher study engineering

 DumbwitPatra
 What expectation employer How I employer assess sure youre unlike others Jobs ARE available But people arent knowledgeable enough Even engineering passouts 8085 cant crack simple dynamic programming questions I hire based coding test I give hackerrank And 400 CS engineers tier 1 collegee 15 20 students per college could get three questions right 35 hours Because want coders strong basics hire theres people If youre one among youll get job If arent need visible proof put efforts specialize particular field The guy leading AI team company BBA background He learnt AI math internet built applications content would show efforts If something like take idea hackathon Youll idea recognized even dont win get job However Im sure understood question right What expecting employer change want see way hiring done

Quantitative Aptitude exams The messages sending prospective employees are

 You care speed memorizing power nothing else developer talk github profiles hobbies come play see resume usually written rounds
 For talk risk takers industry dont want trust prospective employee pass potentially good employee may best aptitude test taking skills

What expect happen

 You assume good aptitude problem skills imply good problem solving skills
 You assume people wont game aptitude round learn enough pass round
 You assume brilliant programmers solve problems time left roster excellent developers

What usually happens

 People game system study solve test problems
 Actually good developers may time study aptitude problems surprise busy learning actual programming Many good developers get filtered first round due lack knowledge aptitude

 I hire based coding test I give hackerrank And 400 CS engineers tier 1 collegee 15 20 students per college could get three questions right 35 hours Because want coders strong basics hire theres people

15 20 students per college seems like right amount students actually passionate field When stakes high Skills go notches Its observer effect As soon people find assessed watched dont perform well

 What expecting employer

 If want Tom Cruise boyfriend need Cameron Diaz If want brilliant developers must innovating company offers weight salary andor Resume Value If I good developer possible I know worth I going put 400 month less

 Stop taking credit work I heard friend got pat back making company 12000 He never got bonus saw 1 money

 I want stop whining start treating employees like human beings Pay proper wage give interesting problems solve Automate boring stuff Dont ask documentation manually Havent heard tools documentation comments code

 Once I hired I want manager actually understands I saying prison warden intimidates devs get things done early deadline came without consulting devs This sure way make devs secretly hate burning out

 I want reasonable worklife balance I passionate programming I human too

 More investment employee training undergraduate education government I know IT companies lobby lot I expect actually put effort improve syllabus colleges suit want terms technical knowledge diverting money towards education

 minusSeven

 define good CS jobs please

a job makes wake early everyday

 gurumodicum
 Fuck CS cant guys something else 

I like CS actually

 diskorukkamma 

 What qualifications  Wheres GitHub link  At onr end spectrum Google paying upwards crore per annum people IISc At end people working game testers 10000₹ per month

Yes I one whining finding good developers It employers looking good developers willing pay living wage

 People working game testers ₹10000 per month

There problem Why willing pay more

I personally looking job I one It good I notice bad side IT occasionally Namely attitude people expect lot less Its managing expectations employer asking employees manager expectations salary

Photography,I need help deciding life Any help would appreciated,37,7fxfgw,roadmap_throwaway,22,"Sorry huge wall text I detailed I need help

Im weird situation life right could use advice Please honest Ill give little background without trying dox I 25yearold graphic designer profession I graduated average college 2013 degree Journalism one biggest mistakes life especially terms three years I lost After graduating college I tough financial situation I immediately get job support Since I knew basics photoshop I applied job graphic designer agency got I worked 8 months quit due deteriorating mental health After I spent year half battling mental condition still affects got job graphic designer startup due financial strain I worked job 6 months till company closed got current job I working around 15 years I skills Now 15 years  6 months I properly learned tools design got idea industry works design front Again I never ambition field I got I skills

Another thing career Since I said I took job desperation Ill honest skills Design doesnt come naturally I zero thought process design I look tons things like brochures ads etc even begin conceptualizing layout color scheme I come across seriously talented dedicated designers sometimes feels ashamed I work Also I terrible I I pretty decent Especially I put heart But last months mental issues lack confidence general bleak outlook life made job harder

Now I feel job reached plateau phase I something better life I wondering I enroll National Institute Designs Graphic Design Post Graduate program I dont know actually help learn improve life job prospects way far whatever I I learned job

Now details Right I get paid 30K month I live absolutely frugal lifestyle eating fancy places beer trips shopping I save around 5K minimum around 10K maximum I talking terms savings If I plan enroll I able 20192021 Batch I feel I need year start properly saving get loans writing entrance exams preparing myself

Now concerns When I look roadmap I job ready age 29 Which scary thought I sorta back square one Another major issue even though life quite bleak one things life keep going woman I love She kind ever pressurize marriage even though parents told I serious convince wait finish graduating

I want know sudden jump worth risk Honestly speaking I feel depressed quite often suicidal mediocre life I led far nothing seems like happy ending Even thinking move taken huge toll already deteriorating mental health I talking help long term terms career opportunities I dont aim slack party college I get I willing slog point death actually help me

What would really help general advice anyone studied NID could tell course worth time money Will I actually learn something Like I said I ready work ass I know I one shot I dont want botch Also know anyone studied could please link post ask them

Edit Hey guys Sorry I saw post Wasnt feeling well went bed posting First thanks taking time talking I sorry I didnt state much technical knowledge source motivation even look NID

Source motivation So like I mentioned I got design I HAD get job bankable skill I use photoshop Everything else I learnt job mostly trial error I started feeling course design would help give structured approach working  A better understanding layouts colors works doesnt Honestly one biggest drawbacks I convincing client final design Like even I present I weird look showing huge lack confidence usually lets ask multiple changes saying happy design The current job I working boss friend college encourages lot work without thinking things end I interact clients still happens They say yeah design okay Could another iteration My friend one convinces accepting design saying lot business jargon Bottom line I always see work mediocre cannot accept I know Degree NID wont immediately impact thought process I fell I least support self saying I idea I want do

Another question I came across times answers people wrote whether I looking study bump salary My answer primarily Yes overtime I would love nice paying job right learn something everything I right looking peoples works I dont know correct I I say I feel degree NID add prestigious college stamp help get better opportunities better network And weight mentally terms confidence

Technical Knowledge hobbies  Adobe Illustrator proficient Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Hobbies  Photography amateur I write bit content But something I would market

Another weird point I dont know relevant I quite well versed pop culture western culture sorts The reason I bringing I use major influence I work terms design Many menus interior decor designs I clients loved inspired said looks feels much different boring things usually see elsewhere I mean huge skill Lot people nowadays globalized dazzle people one liners TV shows designs I mentioned agency I work got lot praise outofboxforindia style work",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7fxfgw/i_need_some_help_in_deciding_what_to_do_with_my/
Photography,R Why Indians blindly running MONEY,28,5zqaur,modgill,99,"What dont understand Indians run Money Wherever look everyday see Indians trying get squeeze every inch penny customers trying sell everything possible etc 

The people working salaries like 50k even 90k 15L month dont actually life honest  MY opinion

Okay person earning 15 L month like cousin delhi extremely busy time I seen high earning salaried class going offices 7 AM 2 hour drive  returning 10pm Sometimes thrown away projects cities months time 

And places Saturdays also working top fierce competition stress anxiety 

I know person earning 3L month He go office 8am returns 11pm He works exports Merchandiser The stress everyday unbelievable He suffers insomnia panic attacks Is MONEY worth health

People dying In exchange What MONEY shit doesnt get stupid 

Before people start burning asking live life I basically started scratch clear goals Mind made company age 21
1 Work 4 hours day
2 Holidays  2 atleast year
3 No Stress related work
4 Debtfree forever
5 SelfSustaining income
6 Passive income investments

Today even dont work live life passive income Hell live even without passive income 

And lot Indians live like way live But choose  one simple reason MORE MONEY 

A lot people know personally like 95 live loans Car loans house loans credit card lines PC limits etc They basically stuck vicious circle spend thrift working asses pay monthly obligations creating obligations FAKE future 

Although transfer frugal acceptable way living realise true happiness family spending time kids chilling sun thinking late office And importantly DEBTFREE Only think creating SelfSustaining earning 

Just ask questions maybe dont apply maybe But think creating Stress yourself
1 Why need phone costs 40k
2 Why need buy house loan
3 Why buy car loan 
4 Why spend dont yet CC
5 Why work 45 Hours week 
6 Why go holiday post pictures facebook EVERYTIME Occasionally okay
7 Why put pictures food eat Insta FB Twitter 
8 Does feel like travelling various places put pictures facebook insta it
9 Dont feel Job hindering actually LIKE Travelling Hiking Trekking Exploring etc
10 Even afford expensive phones ACTUALLY need asked 
11 Have lost touch various people loved WHY Lack TIME
12 Do want learn something technical CANT DO SO EVER Guitar photography boating climbing learning piano learning another language

These A FEW things everyone must ask Because ultimately end We going die one way another And brutally honest lot people going regret lived life Not everything MORE MONEY And die probably forgotten 50 years become celebrity Otherwise chances forgotten instantly 

I even seen people mentioning BALANCE What balance work 6 days week 8 hours day Sunday BALANCE shit doesnt sound like 5050 balance We sleep around 8 hours day And rest activities SHOULD day would constitute around 78 hours Breakfast Lunch Dinner Exercise Errands What left 8 hours FREE WORK Exercise totally forgotten even 2 hours exercise given work 

Where time contemplate think feel things ACTUALLY want 

I think even working 4 hours day TOO MUCH infact 23 hours 

Money something BANKS created thin air ask pay interest 

Have thought INTEREST money comes pay  You guessed BANKS print There Way DEBT system 

Only changes lifestyle way feel world result self sustainable income environment  things want 

Think things deeply

Photography,Kota District Collectors letter parents IIT aspirants NP,185,4i91ig,grasssrootz,40,"Dear Parents

On behalf Kota City I take opportunity welcome child city wonders processes young minds country fuels passion become architects Modern India

My humble request beginning letter read patience time would ideal parents read together

It dream every parent see child touch pinnacles success reach places afford Every parent plants seed mind child period time bears fruits careful nourishment tendering since seed tender mishandling may fail us realizing dream

It difficult situation parents leave child place live things become still difficult purpose child left behind dedicated committed efforts scaling excellence education

When parents look huge billboard signagehoarding newspaper clips depicting pictures young beautiful children achieved dream child resolution inspire motivate children becomes still stronger

Good career field Engineering  Medicine case may less like certain insurance terms decent earning living standards I sincerely think cases reason makes us dream careers children

There nothing wrong thinking certain kind Assured Career Insurance one’s child since limited resources high degree competition demands one think ahead times

However I think agree world changed drastically last 1520 years much facilities services available limited available many due huge progress technology witnessed period

Art Entertainment Professional Sports Literature Health  Fitness Entrepreneurship Journalism Photography Event management Music Adventure Destination tourism etc name witnessed immense growth comparison bygone era

Many even created new niche nurtured creative potential human mind capabilities also successful career options

Well point asking see better options certainly see also options

It matter fact today young children facing immense amount pressure relating academic performance due many go various levels stress

Even consider certain element stress would exist competition parental support care right kind family situations would help child cope difficult situation

However current reality due lack right kind conditions support systems many children going stress uncared unattended cases situations disabled children extreme extent committed suicide…

Don’t get frightened suddenly said child… Your child perfectly safe sound reasons worry reasons concern child I believe understand read letter further

I consider unfortunate person I got chance read around 2025 Suicide Notes Young Brilliant Beautiful Wonderful Children

Am I giving many adjectives children committed Suicide

I sorry Answer No… They fact I said earlier Young Brilliant Beautiful Wonderful Children

A Girl amazing command English language suicide note grammatically perfect 5page Suicide Note beautiful running handwriting thanks mother giving career raising children… Subtle hint pricked matter again

Another girl wants grandmother become mother next birth Another requests parents allow younger sister likes like One tells candidly manipulated study science taste Many simply write fewer lines could fulfil expectations parents Rather say really capable asked them

All thought Death much peaceful effortless action going dilemma artificially parents want do

As say “Tip Iceberg” reveals little hides mountains within similarly apparent Suicide Cases reflect numbers reality hidden mountain children opt take extreme step certainly going stressworryanxiety due pressure performance

Many Parents cannot believe disaster child took drastic measure I don’t mean hurt sentiments reality child mentally looking blade grass drowning man searches That blade grass could simple appreciation efforts… solacing words comforts asking best forget results absolute unconditioned appreciation extraordinariness

In return child got threats performing still better…psychological manipulation repeat retelecasting hardships gone sake family comparison better performers neighbors relatives children colleague ancestors…could anyone sharing imagination lossnotional gain social status dependent child’ performance

We need understand statistically speaking many children commit suicide comparison total number children coping academic pressure analyze numbers life analysis tells us hopes dreams overlooked hurt many times So high time pause contemplate bit I need take pause since I hear many saying kids like many things good So question I tend hear is… Should parents go childrenâ€™s immature ways Not necessarily

Well let us try see good things resisted… Eating right sleeping right talking right behaving right seeing right listening right reading right etc

Child actually observes parents never follows anything blindly Moreover one thing certain… Child analyses looks parents see whether case things preached followed parents begin soWhether parents really loving joyful peaceful happy so

They tend pick habits parents make happy peaceful…In case seriously messed situations child may even like you

It may appear strange extremely annoying… But possibility child liking you… This comes many forms shades Absolute dislike liking traits liking comparing someone better liking protective care concern may think love suffocating child liking double standards may have… etc

So objective letter make realise child dislikes you

Answer big No Your child dislike you… I making point unconsciously may created situation need undo…

Children parents’ responsibility one teach parent responsibility intend so… Parents really think good children’s future point I need make dreams always limited experience good… successful… best thing… Well truth child may surpass imagination reach places never even dreamed of…

We come different segments society terms social  economic status culture religion belief systems etc However far natural principle upbringing child concerned remain everywhere

I expert Parenting many credentials “Right Child Care Practices” I fully understand different kind children need different kind interventions yet I would request divert little attention fundamental aspects relating child management

Creating right kind atmosphere child grow flower home making home really happy loving peaceful place live
Understanding needs children There two extremes case…Making child go terrible hardships realise “Your” dreams one end end overpampered care… Both definitely work

Take time switch teaching mode learning mode child since children show way really happy peaceful times…Instead learning form tend always assume role teacherpreacher

Allow child “to be” terms I mean especially child’s engagement nature world around empower right kind communication skills accommodative Interaction gender due coming age aberration normal process keep note try prevent totally

Spend time children without complaining office life situation problems hardships timeâ€¦ It may really late want spend time available child Why Because may made like effort tutor We certainly benchmark child Many times may regressive rudimentary types comparison ability child

Just final thought Are interested making child realise “Your Dreams” cost like creating situations child realises “HisHer” Dreams

I could simply attended Parents Counselling Session admission spoken issues usually happens gatherings conditioned influenced impression person sitting next people think different

Nothing wrong disagreeing best disagree terms instead getting influenced others Finally I would like tender unconditional apology taking time telling things Child Management I expert words letter gathered limited experience Kota dealing similar cases certainly great men inspired put thoughts you

Be Best Parent World
I sure competition there

Yours Sincerely

Tl dr

In today’s speech announcing extension India’s national lockdown till 3rd May 2020 country’s Prime Minister requested citizens download Aarogya Setu applicationhttpswwwnews18comnewstechpmmodisaysaarogyasetuappiscriticalinthefightagainstcovidhereishowitworks2576857html Unfortunately application remains privacy minefield adhere principles minimisation strict purpose limitation transparency accountability IFF’s Working Paper analyses application highlights inconsistent right privacy conceivably risk toward permanent system mass surveillance suggests clear recommendations arrest risks

Background

On April 13 2020 IFF released working paper called  “Privacy Prescriptions technology interventions COVID19 Indiahttpsdrivegooglecomfiled1UK5rElhcdP5T3Y8fYP6cCgQKKpQBeOXview” A significant portion working paper dedicated proliferation experimental contact tracing applications India across world India also launched contact tracing solution called Aarogya Setu

IFF’s working paper alert Chapters 57 devote significant space studying emergent government nongovernment practices standard setting processes first principles space Chapter 7 paper studies three specific models contact tracing including Singapore Government’s Trace Together application MIT’s Private Kit Safe Paths initiative Aarogya Setu

What Contact Tracing

According WHO contact tracing occurs three steps namely contact identification b contact listing c contact follow In particular contact tracing pillar helps public health officials containing pace transmission virus This pace transmission measured unit R0 R naught essentially connotes number people infected person spread disease onto

Contact tracing traditionally administered use ground personnel volunteer armies However ubiquity smartphones collect vast troves personal information governments across world believe surveillance aid rapid contact tracing But owing peculiarities coronavirus authorities across world beginning realise limited efficacy associated respect location surveillance cell tower data GPS signals   


As result governments groups either released developing smartphone apps use Bluetooth beacons GPS signals log instances wherein user’s device comes contact another user’s device When user app detected Covid19 contact tracing officers might able use app identify close contacts prior days weeks  


What’s Risk   


With creation systems come new risks institutionalisation mass surveillance Critically India lacks comprehensive data protection law outdated surveillance interception laws meaningful proposals meaningful reform In domains like disaster relief  most apps purported ‘contact tracing’ technologies often devolve systems movement control lockdown enforcement

A lot technology solutions demonstrable scientific value national response passed public interest It leads poor deployment public resources also makes difficult crisis responders discern “snake oil” quality technology products These risks exacerbated technology markets since adequate checks balances development phases ensure quality

Such systems inadvertently discriminate regions fewer concentrations smartphones Specifically lead harmful outcomes people residing economically weaker areas In countries public health systems already creaking looming threat capacity deficits If systems wrongly urge people preemptively take tests risk public health systems may overwhelmed prematurely

It may also exacerbate risks associated harvesting personal data like health information also see creation new privacy invasive systems

How prevent risks

Such systems must consider embedding following principles among others

1 The usage applications voluntary
2 All data always stored locally people’s devices
3 This data must encrypted
4 No Government access later point must ensure nothing centralised server
5 Governments must appreciate data location information proximity confirmations health status whether placed isolation sensitive personal information
6 Privacy design assurances phone numbers recorded data encrypted pseudonymisation deployed use app “voluntary” based consent Most protections known techniques circumvention  


Therefore need adhere two principles

1 Strict limits  in terms collection duration every step way and
2 Comprehensive evidencebased justifications every step way

Aarogya Setu compares unfavourably Singapore MIT

httpspreviewreddit0zw655ssbss41jpgwidth540formatpjpgautowebps488f2ca51d6a194e6858495a346eb42e072a2d5b

Consider following aspects

Is disease control purposes

In countries health authorities leading efforts respond COVID19 For example Singapore health ministry use systems access limited datainteraction shared European authorities making similar commitments They assure citizens law enforcement personnel access systems data therein

In India multiple committees set context Aarogya Setu technology responses coronavirus But formal notifications press reports reference major involvement Ministry Health Family Welfare Instead health authorities tertiary institutional players

To protect people’s right privacy countries including Singapore say contact tracing used strictly disease control cannot used enforce lockdowns quarantines Aarogya Setu retains flexibility ensure comply legal orders on

Minimisation What Minimisation

1 Singapore monitors people’s interactions Bluetooth beacons MIT GPS there’s India uses both
2 Other apps collect one data point subsequently replaced scrubbed device identifier India’s Aarogya Setu collects multiple data points personal sensitive personal information increases privacy risks

No Transparency leads discretion

The information app frontend rather pedestrian Terms Service TOS Privacy Policy Other projects release much information possible pursuit transparency This may include accompanying manifesto technical specifications general FAQs even source code Not Aarogya Setu go opposite route also prohibits external good faith actors reverse engineering application scrutiny information security related research help facilitate stability

Similarly app capable wrongfully identifying people COVID19 positive admitted app’s Terms Service We ask report question paper mean people get diagnosed infected coronavirus based application rather actual medical test Similarly mean false positive entails I cannot use public transport go work leave city visit friends This evokes imagery Chinese model surveillance COVID19 highlighted risks well report

No Accountability No Auditability

The Government blanket liability limitation clause inserted service agreements privacy policies This means citizens cannot hold Government accountable seek judicial remedy wish ensure Government’s processes compliant right privacy

Second Government talks certain obligations delete certain personal data application 30 day time period However expected claim comes enough exceptions facilitate government discretion This compounded fact researchers individual users cannot actually check Government deleted people’s personal information means transparently auditing app backend

Risk Permanence Compromises Autonomy  The Anonymisation Gambit

Finally app runs palpable risks either expanding scope becoming permanent surveillance architecture People describing current times 911 steroids And 911 saw creation proliferation mass interception capabilities governments The Government failed provide defined period intends review delete ultimately destroy systems data collected Aarogya Setu project Second already reports confirm server linked government datasets Such linking increases risks permanent systems mass surveillance

Finally Government says TOS Privacy Policy apply capacity falls category anonymised data sets The government cannot say something anonymised aggregated longer personally identifiable without showing citizens ensuring This level transparency minimum since vulnerability anonymised datasets people’s informational privacy security well documented information security communities Considering risk anonymised data sets becoming permanent systems data analysis Government keep accountable public scrutiny

Conclusion

IFF addressed challenges many undertaking case studies paper eventually sets series 17 recommendations ensure people’s informational privacy protected even uncertain times wherein Indian authorities viewing civil liberties afterthought

My Answer Clothes Shoes

1 Industrialization Historically models industrialisation followed two pathways
  Slow Steady Where Western Advanced economies like USA  UK undertook economic development tandem political development They begin universal franchise This helped fiscal economic development limiting initial demands state period capacity weak
  Accelerated Growth economic successes mostly East Asia began authoritarian explicitly Korea China de facto Singapore Thailand Taiwan gave way political transformation degree economic success achieved

2 Where India Stand India attempted economic development also granting universal franchise beginning The countries group Botswana Mauritius Jamaica Trinidad Tobago Costa Rica — perennial democracies At independence India one poorest nations regardless political system per capita GDP 617 PPP This implies
  The Indian state ever burdened demands redistribution since early life  leading poor state capacity see today healthcare education law enforcement
  There distrust Private Sector overreliance Public capacity
  Exit winding declaring bankruptcy plugging inefficiencies hard diverse stakeholders vested interests poor institutions

3 What Kind Jobs India Need  India needs generate jobs formal productive provide bangforbuck terms jobs created relative investment potential broader social transformation generate exports growth Apparel Footwear sectors fit bill

4 How Apparel Footwear worked East Asian Economies In successful East Asian economies countries GDP growth booms averaged 710 per cent growth exports two sectors exceptional For comparison 20 year period postliberalisation economy
  CountryYear TakeOffAnnual avg export growth 20 years post take per cent ApparelAnnual avg export growth 20 years post take per cent Leather FootwearAnnual avg economic growth 20 years post take per cent

Malaysia197033427569
China197818627798
Vietnam198517816166
India19801275456

5 Why India underperformed For lot historical religious sociocultural reasons However pertinent contemporary times include
  Logistics Costs Time getting goods factorytoport greater Furthermore Indian ports unequipped handle large capacity containers We use Sri Lankan ports transshipments
  Labor Regulations Labor costs low regulations strangulate formalization high overtime pay requirements de facto EPF contribution taxes lowpaid workers inflexible firing policies

  Tax Tariff Policies Indias domestic tax policies unbalanced promote cottonbased fibres instead manmade fibres bulk global demand Similarly global demand nonleather footwear Indias share global exports leather footwear double nonleather footwear ie wrongly focuses leather footwear

  Export Market Discrimination EU US impose customs tariffs Indian apparel footwear exports 10 0 Bangladesh So Indian firms shift operations outside India

Policy/Economy,Economists rIndia  give views comments inflation India relationship unemployment  Read details,7,g141sz,ParmanuMan,2,"Recently  I reading article inflation unemployment

AW Phillips one first economists present compelling evidence inverse relationship unemployment wage inflation Phillips studied relationship unemployment rate change wages United Kingdom period almost full century 18611957 he discovered latter could explained level unemployment and b rate change unemployment

Phillips hypothesized demand labor high and unemployed workers employers expected bid wages quite rapidly However demand labor low and unemployment high workers reluctant accept lower wages prevailing rate result wage rates fall slowly

A second factor affects wage rate changes rate change unemployment If business booming employers bid vigorously workers means demand labor increasing fast pace ie percentage unemployment decreasing rapidly would demand labor either increasing eg percentage unemployment unchanging increasing slow pace

Does mean current governments quest low inflation indirectly leading unemployment going 

Low inflation means companies investors initiative invest  However times inflation  investors look places invest money since keep losing  value kept ideal 

During Congress years 20042014  high inflation also probably lead increased consumer spending expenditure Since large sector Indian economy dependent internal consumption  experienced significant growth due 


The reserve bank India also extremely focused fighting inflation  Many people saying obsession inflation causing keep interest rates high  result private companies initiative borrow loans new ventures


As examples hyperinflation show states powerful incentive keep price rises check For past century US approach manage inflation using monetary policy To the Federal Reserve the US central bank relies on relationship between inflation interest rates If interest rates are low companies individuals borrow cheaply start business earn degree hire new workers buy shiny new boat In words low rates encourage spending investing generally stoke inflation turnBy raising interest rates central banks put damper rampaging animal spirits

They fear collapse activity stopped another fortnight
Lives could lost hunger livelihoods sacrificed lockdown

The cash transfers poor hiked least ₹3000 month next three months This addition free rations cooking gas announced earlier
Outofthebox ideas delivering support also raising required funds might required 
The government let go fiscal conservatism go spend support economy Economists unanimous little option print money spend developed countries doing
In harvest season farmers need logistical support moving produce markets
Lenders including NBFCs granted freedom reschedule loan accounts borrowers pressure repay fear turning delinquent 
A credit guarantee fund support nondelinquent borrowers next six months good option 
Such fund financed domestic bond offering 
The bankruptcy code suspended next six months least MSMEs 
A GST holiday next three months would good option

	1	Are NRC CAA separate

Yes 

NRC law It process mandated  Indian Citizenship  Registration Citizens Issue National Identity Cards Rules 2003
Source

But connected 

YES

Since rules issued time time government taken consideration interpreting law In fact clause every Act specifying case Section 18 Indian Citizenship Act 1955

Source

	2	What CAA misused

a CAA it’s unconstitutional

The core idea make easier  undocumented immigrants Afghanistan Bangladesh Pakistan get Indian citizenship The catch immigrants can’t Muslims

Are really ‘persecuted minorities’ would benefit legislation

Yes 31313 individuals precise
This revealed government hearing parliamentary committee 2016 version Bill The committee asked many people would benefit legislation The Intelligence Bureau replied


But specifically excluding Muslims Jews Bill raised justified concerns Modi government trying enshrine religious discrimination law 

This Article 14 India’s constitution prohibits discrimination religious basis

Why Act violate Article 14

Article 14 Equality Law

‘the state shall deny person equality law equal protection laws within territory India prohibition discrimination grounds religion race caste sex place birth’

The opposition MPs pointed Amit Shah insisted exception Article 14 “reasonable classification” making laws 

In simple words State discriminate citizens grounds special benefits offered eg reservations marginalised communities

This matter whether “reasonable classification” justified Act contended Courts decided later

b How CAA misused

CAA amended parliamentary procedures 

The government said amendment made provide remedy six communities namely Hindu Sikh Buddhist Jain Parsi Christian community Afghanistan Bangladesh Pakistan seeking shelter religious persecution fear religious persecution

However religious persecution cited anywhere CAA 2019 The bare act reads

Provided person belonging Hindu Sikh Buddhist Jain Parsi Christian community Afghanistan Bangladesh Pakistan entered India 31st day December 2014 exempted Central Government clause c subsection 2 section 3 Passport Entry India Act 1920 application provisions Foreigners Act 1946 rule order made thereunder shall treated illegal migrant purposes Act 



Religious persecution actually mentioned Rules amended Passport Entry India Act 1920



This important understand Government make changes rules anytime want Rules basically subordinate laws central government issue gazette notification time These laws require approval parliament


The point important explaining NRC

3 What NRC

The National Register Citizens NRC registry maintained Government India containing names  certain relevant information identification Indian citizens 

The Nationwide NRC process already underway NPR proposed implemented 2021 census

a What NPR

The NPR list “usual residents country” According Ministry Home Affairs “usual resident country” one residing local area least last six months intends stay particular location next six months 

Unlike NRC NPR citizenship enumeration drive would record even foreigner staying locality six months
 It mandatory every “usual resident India” register NPR

The NPR collect demographic data biometric data There 15 different categories demographic data ranging name place birth education occupation RGI supposed collect NPR 

For biometric data depend Aadhaar seek Aadhaar details residents This allow Union government first time connect biometric details information like birthplace parents

Apart test run going across country RGI seeking details mobile number Aadhaar PAN card Driving Licence Voter ID card passport case resident Indian It also working update Civil Registration System birth death certificates

Even issues privacy associated Aadhaar continue debated country NPR drive collect detailed data residents India With recent introduction Personal Data Protection Bill Centre exempts agencies provisions proposed bill lot red flags raised misuse data

Source

b How NPR linked NRC

The legal framework National Population Register grounded Citizenship Act 1955 In 2003 Act amended Atal Bihari Vajpayeeled BJP government introduce category “illegal migrant” To implement amendment set rules issued 

The link rules 1 Are CAA NRC different

The rules read “The Central Government shall purpose National Register Indian Citizens cause carry throughout country housetohouse enumeration collection specified particulars relating family individual residing local area including Citizenship status”

How would registers citizens created The rules explicitly spell 

“The Local Register Indian citizens shall contain details persons due verification made Population Register”

When Local Register generated Population Register “verification process” would carried would create category “doubtful citizenship” 

The final National Register Citizens would prepared asking doubtful citizens prove Indians part “claims objections” process

This Population Register mentioned rules nothing National Population Register

Link
 In gazette notification issued July 31 2019 Modi government passed order “prepare update Population Register” every state Assam

c Arguments NRC

	i	A botched exercise Assam

The National Register Citizens Assam updated past years identify undocumented migrants come mostly Bangladesh 1971 

The updated NRC supposed document people whose names listed NRC 1951 still alive well living descendants could prove permanent residents state

It botched exercise There many errors process
Source

 In around 19 lakh people Assam excluded final register 
Source

Soon BJP started complaining many undocumented immigrants included register around five lakh Bengali Hindus excluded In fact even people campaigned BJP found excluded

Source BJP complaining botched NRC
Source 5 lakh Bengali Hindus excluded NRC
Source BJP campaigners find excluded

Anyone able prove citizenship NRC put detention centres
Reports violation Human rights detention centres alarming

Source A newborn died detention centre Assam Their mother later found foreigner


	ii	Loopholes inconsistencies existing citizenship laws

There lot speculation around cut dates proving ancestry based pilot NRC launched Assam nothing concrete far determined since nation wide Bill hasn’t drafted

But one thing know sure  every person resident India required prove citizenship

How one prove citizenship

This matters get complex

If don’t consider speculated ancestry provision may may included nation wide NRC The current law citizenship follows 


The Citizenship Act defines citizen as

Section 3

Citizenship birth —

1 Except provided subsection 2 every person born India—
a 26th day January 1950 1st day July 1987

b 1st day July 1987 commencement Citizenship Amendment Act 2003 either whose parents citizen India time birth

c commencement Citizenship Amendment Act 2003 where—
i parents citizens India or
ii one whose parents citizen India illegal migrant time birth 

shall citizen India birth

Short is

If born India 1987 1950 citizen

If born 1987 2003 either parents Indian citizens citizen

If born 2003 parents Indian citizens one parents Indian citizen illegal immigrant citizen

So born 1987 you’re Indian citizen birth

If you’re born 1987 prove parents Indian citizens What orphans

How it

If you’re born 1987 prove citizenship provision birth certificate documents may prescribed NRC

Assuming parents educated organised enough would able preserve birth certificate documents people lower middle class slightly privileged backgrounds may done weren’t educated informed enough importance documents This leaves person state handicap


If you’re born 1987 considering  almost 44 India’s population  24 years age total 85 population 54 years age safely conclude group constitutes large chunk India’s population

You prove least one parents Indian citizen So you’re born 1987 naturally parents born 1987 You’ll provide necessary documents YOUR PARENTS
to prove THEY’RE Indian citizens Basically expect preserve possess documents dating back much 1960’s

Many news agencies reporting mere submitting passports Aadhar cards shall suffice THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE

Mere submitting passports birth certificate shall suffice prove citizenship ruled Bombay high court 2013
Source

In conclusion
67 population still rural per 2015 census This coupled inadequate infrastructure lacking admin capacities implement nationwide program like would disaster

	iii	Why NRC promotes inequality Muslims

Imagine scenario nationwide NPR rolled The babus administering exercise mess end sending whole bunch people  faiths “specified proforma” register 


Now legal recourse available people six religions mentioned CAA Do note law specifically says people belonging faiths “shall treated illegal migrants Muslims however recourse For matter even Jews won’t able anything exclusion register 

As result lakhs crores excluded people might declare illegal immigrants become Indian citizens again

The tricky part proving religious  persecution another country

To benefit CAA person issued specified proforma NPR must prove one nonMuslim migrant Afghanistan Pakistan Bangladesh 

and two came India escape religious persecution 

read point mentioned CAA But Government make rules Passport Act essentially whim government simply strike second condition keep first

Credit

	iv	Economic cost

The Global economy slowdown India exception I generally never attribute GDP numbers Government since active participation Government GDP via public expenditure still crucial However Government actively makes policies detrimental state economy fingers pointed

This case NRC

 In Assam alone cost 1220 crores  1500 crores ended massive failure
Source
 
The national cost implementing NRC would run lakhs crores With Indian economy current situation implementing NRC would surely leave visible dent Indian economy Especially absence ROI Return Investment policy

The estimated cost might close 23 lakh crores unverified

Source This opinion piece figures may effect inflated underestimated

Say costs 3 lakh crores it’s still 157 last year’s GDP ie 272 Trillion

However like Demonetisation act bring country halt People line yet verification centres document verification follow ups  enquiries 

In Assam NRC updating started July 30 2018 ended August 31 2019 despite taking year complete process entire process ended material inconsistencies glaring errors
Source

A nationwide implementation would cost years loss productivity economic cost practice would dangerous

Demonetisation caused GDP growth drop 61 though recovered later quarters consumption patterns stabilised too
Source

Over 15 million jobs lost Q3 FY 201617 post implementation demonetisation
Source CMIE report

The nation wide implementation NRC similar larger impact economy time come substantial human cost

	v	Cost Error

The NRC exercise would highly prone error—both Type I Type II 

Explanation

Type I errors  False positives 

Mistakenly identifying person immigrant protected minority communities Hindus Sikhs Buddhists Jains Parsis Christians Afghanistan Bangladesh Pakistan erroneously giving benefit Indian citizenship 

Immigrants usually net economic benefit costs Type I errors confined national security 

These costs nationwide typically limited handful border districts India


Type II errors False negatives

These occur qualify Indian citizens mistakenly categorized illegal immigrants A nationwide NRC similar one Assam would imply false negatives get sent detention centres deported

Type II errors extremely costly To minimize false negatives bar qualify citizen simple easily identifiable 

Also infrastructure scrutinize paperwork NRC exceptionally efficient 

The Indian state usually fails counts Given CAB’s current religious exclusionary basis Muslims higher risk exclusion false negatives though groups including Hindus likely affected errors


There three main issues consider 


The first tradeoff Type I Type II errors 

If avoid false positives government high level scrutiny NRC inclusion individuals burden meeting higher bar In process might mistakenly excluded 

On hand bar set low prevent false negatives erroneous exclusions illegal immigrants may slip cracks 
The current CAB framework combined NRC set minimize false positives automatically increase false negatives


The third issue magnitude error

1 If Govt executes well 5 error 675 million people displaced equalling displacement WW II

2 If Aadhaar error rate 88 120 million left out

3 If 1 error still 135 million Indians displaced partition India

Both source materials data opinion pieces since numbers estimated read accordingly

IFF responded call public comments suggestions Joint Committee Personal Data Protection PDP Bill 2019 sent across submission behalf SaveOurPrivacy campaign In provided substantive inputs essential privacy principles thematic analysis major issues Bill We also appended public brief containing highlevel clause clause analysis Bill Additionally appended two issue specific briefs workplace surveillance b relationship PDP Bill National Population Register   


Essential First Principles

As first step apprised Committee since right privacy recognised Supreme Court also includes informational privacy primary lens eventual law framed In regard also mentioned Supreme Court right privacy judgement KS Puttaswamy v Union India made observation right privacy subsists public spaces well In regard highlighted lot users’ experiences online occur certain corners internet publicsemipublic nature Therefore India’s data protection law must respect therefore accord adequate privacy protections domains  


In addition noted Joint Committee could shape India’s data protection law incorporate seven privacy principleshttpssaveourprivacyinprinciples Indian Privacy Code 2018 developed SaveOurPrivacy campaign These principles based Hon’ble Supreme Court’s decision KS Puttaswamy v Union India global examples like European Union’s EU’s General Data Protection Regulation The seven privacy principles emphasise individual rights center privacy data protection government respect user privacy They also address need creation strong supervisory authority surveillance reform   


Major Concerns addressed Committee

Subsequently done thematic analysis top substantive concerns PDP Bill This includes limited themes  


1    Inclusion treatment social media intermediaries Bill

The Bill requires social media platforms identified “significant data fiduciaries” set infrastructure allows users India voluntarily verify accounts This measure hampers online anonymity thereby right privacy Additionally allow social media entities access peoples government issued identity documents This lead aggregation demographic information across different social media companies databases This creates immense scope companies build granular user profiles commercialise personal sensitive personal data individuals We therefore ask Committee remove provision PDP Bill  


2   Need chapter surveillance reform

Presently India sufficient privacy safeguards place comes surveillance carried government The frameworks currently place India’s Information Technology Act Telegraph Act geared towards national security fail adequately protect privacy In particular lack sufficient institutional legislative oversight Thus proposed need separate chapter surveillance reform Bill along lines Indian Privacy Code 2018  


3   Exceptions central government access nonpersonal data

A provision PDP Bill Clause 91 provides carveout Central Government access anonymised nonpersonal data frame policies interest digital economy Such provisions show proposed law far interested treating data resource We believe data protection law used legislative backdoor commodify data  


4   Issues proposed structure Data Protection Authority DPA accompanying appellate structure

 The selection committee consists secretarylevel officials Two issues arise accountability neither democratically elected judicial members ii diversity doesn’t reflect executive judicial external expertise Thus proposed open call applications selection committee inclusive terms representation
 We noted Bill impairs independence DPA allowing Government frame policies binding them
 To ensure quicker localised decision making proposed state regional DPA benches
 We think things stand Appellate Tribunal would lack transparency To end proposed must publish decisions   


5   The “reasonable purposes” exemption allows personal data processed without consent reasonable purposes Clause 14 Bill

The exemptions granted clause fairly wide It classifies publicly available personal data “reasonable purposes” category We think backdoor towards profiling allow collation demographicindividual sentiments issues We also think would allow government powerful data fiduciaries aggregate social networking activities without need individual consent The right privacy applicable public spaces Therefore proposed provision removed reasonable purposes exception since excessive encroachment people’s privacy public spaces  


In addition themes also major issues Bill discussed length submission The SaveOurPrivacy collective also authored briefs explainers different areas PDP Bill We sharing JPC public relevant stakeholders hope analysis inform future outcomes

Policy/Economy,The problem BJP supporters,66,ed1ehe,vardhan68,16,"Okay first ever post reddit I keen observer Indian politics since last 6 years I voter voted BJP good faith thinking different parties But since last years view point completely changed But post wont discuss actions BJP led change political stance would rather post real problem BJP supporters 

I might wrong observations personal experience 

1 BJP fans simply dont understand simultaneously oppose two political parties As soon start debating certain issue straight away associate congress communists even terrorist They believe every one BJP joined faction 

2 Staunch BJP fans certainly dont realize person isnt nation BJP  They rebrand anti national even ask logical questions government policies These people forgetting every right question government protest dont think something right That distinguishes us country like North Korea Saudi Arabia We king rather prime minister responsible answering us 

3 BJP supporters tend discredit every source criticizes government These people ready accept fact someone affiliated political party criticize government If post newspaper article condemns government simply start calling anti Indian congress sponsored propaganda 

4 BJP supporters also use tool called Whataboutism They justify wrongdoing referring wrongdoing parties For example okay BJP corrupt congress corrupt But understand change fact even BJP corrupt trying bring positive changes cannot repeat mistakes predecessors made 

5 BJP supporters cant accept fact person constructive destructive work I agree BJP also brought positive changes doesnt justify wrongdoing You appreciate criticize person time Just voted shouldnt make immune criticism You chose represent every right criticize actions appreciate good work 

6 Even clearly see BJP playing communal politics turn blind eye They say congress played dirtier one whataboutism best Congress played communal politics reason voted But new party also starts support basis vote  

7 As soon communal card played like mandir BJP fans always deviate real issues like economy poverty economic reforms business investments Their first priority become resolve petty issue rather real ones 


So thoughts issue day age still fighting issues British wanted us fight Religion upon time used unite people right playing divisive role We modern generation stop taking pride religion get emotional voting basis religion It matter whatever degree caste votes basis particular religion value getting education goes zero Dont let social media dictate perspective research make mindset rather following mindset crowd

In Indian context arguments partially true Firstly word boomer refers baby boomers generation born post WWII 19461964 This period great healthcare became accessible everyone developed nations child mortality dropped fast However birthrates remained relatively high though decreasing led high number kids born This golden period American growth  women boomers joined labor force great productivity rise labor Middleclass grew moved suburbs could live idylic existence benefits big cities well countryside Boomers led positive existence  birthrates decreased subsequently boomers also disproportionate power voting block bolstered fact voting  boomers much higher subsequent generations So could bring keep laws line values oldfashioned according successors Moreover older people living savings hate increase inflation comes debtfueled government spendings So natural generation debt hawks also meant opposition subsidies led rise education debt amongst younger generationHence legitimate cause angst politically savvy young people forced live society controlled oldies support arcane laws abortion instance go benefits education subsidies

However India completely different demographic profile Purely terms largest generation boomers India We born around high growth postliberalization India opportunities terms private sector jobs access information older generation boomers booming economy whereas parents depression war Even political block young people biggest electoral power amongst generations power partially harnessed BJP two elections Moreover dropping birthrates India would also grow old era depressed population growth continue influential generation  like boomers

However also true older generation bigoted religiouslycastewise minded us role morally bankrupt polity country There blame certainly lay older generation But whole boomer spiel west wherein millennial generation claims boomers much better life actively spoiling present future current youth certainly applicable Our parents generation life scarcity terms resources opportunities Even interested reading history talking parents watch movies  heroes characters struggling find work getting rejected could pay bribes part every story Apart government jobs city apart tierI little opportunities licenseraj era Statistically lower economic growth poverty

Sumit explaining Shweta good movie While explaining simultaneously watching road He view road ahead He spotted two SUVs parked across road block He saw half dozen people standing front His heart skipped beat

His body stiffened Shweta felt

In Social Media Narendra Modi always appeared man treated everyone equally However rallies actual persona could seen Millions watched helplessly brainwashed thousands every week The BJP realised needed brainwash gullible To tell Hinduism threat That country going Muslims 

Muslims accused many things The economy bad They blamed They accused muslims impersonating Hindus get away practice religion secretly This rumour became widespread Muslims left stateless National Registry Citizens introduced 2020

The importance higher savings cannot underestimated accoring survey It high rising savings country selffinance high investments Otherwise must seek foreign savings gets translated high current account deficit turn makes vulnerable times crises 


They survey continually made mention China fastgrowing East Asian economies making case countless graphs It clear chief inspiration 

Having high savings naturally means correspondingly low domestic consumption Thus way fast growth domestic consumption subdued fast export growth They survey made case India still low share world export market plenty scope regain regardless trade tensions

Policy/Economy,Real Talk Indias economic future screwed one anything,22,e5d76w,mrfreeze2000,8,"Im starting based assumption way lowermiddle income countries like India prosper manufacturingled exportoriented economy

This proven model prosperity 20th 21st centuries

This manufacturing cant kind It low skill highvolume order employ large number people Indias current manufacturing pattern mostly filled highskill low employment products like jewellery medicine cars software

Its far easier train 10000 people make iPhone accessories get make cars

But kind highvolume low skill manufacturing isnt coming India regardless policy push government 

A reasons why

x200B

1 Competitors SE Asia specialized certain products like garments Bangladesh b fewer roadblocks investment populace autocracies pseudodemocracies c cultural affinity China Vietnam makes easier Chinese manufacturers move shop there
2 Businesses built relationships policy leverage Policy makers dont get ever run businesses By American businesses decadelong relationships Chinese manufacturers These Chinese manufacturers building factories Vietnam Laos Cambodia If American business would rather partner  unknown entity India Vietnamese arm Chinese manufacturer know trust
3 Supply chains hard build harder optimize If wanted manufacturing power 2020 would start work 2015 2019 Weve lost moment
4 Indias regional inequality means states cheap labor Bihar UP also states one wants invest law order problems
5 Indias democracy means everything becomes much challenging manufacturer  land acquisition labor issues etc Vietnam meanwhile bulldoze whatever hell wants bulldoze put red carpet manufacturers
6 And might biased personal take Ive felt Indian manufacturers dont business competence Ive tried build products India well China Our Chinese partners treated us small company might later big company gave us respect priority Our Indian partner treated us small fry keen getting shortterm profit build longterm relationship

I feel moment India could manufacturing power past us 

Without manufacturing youll situation where

x200B

1 The state spend welfare tackle unemployment among young population
2 To pay welfare state increasingly overreach tax collection Youre seeing already small section population pays nearly taxes
3 The small portion people good jobs increasingly resentful taxes spent welfare This coupled environmental issues accelerate brain drain capital flight
4 Without capital manpower employment generation even slower forcing state squeeze even If welfare dole stops knows going widespread unrest 
5 All welfare tax state exchequer Were seeing already  government hit fiscal deficit target year 7 months 
6 One welfare dole stops tens millions unemployed angry poor people revolt

There problems way govern country today political parties today entrenched histories dynasties Hindutva regionalism casteism communism crony capitalism et cetera able find solutions India needs move forward

Indian humanist Party IhP facebook page finding solutions We yet political party may years even decades reach critical mass We see IhP forerunner political party one day govern India humanist principles build happy prosperous clean green united safe country

The principles humanism include primacy fundamental human rights using evidencebased rationality make policy decisions

This atheist organization The word humanist used refer secular humanism commitment interpretations religious texts ideologies lead conclusion violating fundamental human rights justified considered unacceptable

We believe people freedom belief freedom belief government political parties involved propagating inhibiting religion That role believe best left individuals communities The two principles humanism applied actions party are

1 The primacy fundamental human rights
2 Using evidencebased rationality empathy foundation decision making

Its time India move Hindutva inspired vision humanist inspired one

This 50year project

The RSS started nearly century ago 1925 community volunteers create Hindu rashtra alternative Congress vision secular India In 1984 BJP Hindutva inspired party two seats last 35 years replaced Congress dominant force country’s politics

Our goal learn replicate successes RSS BJP enjoyed help India transition Hindutva inspired vision humanist inspired one one believe feel effective achieving goals The goal actualize original vision Congress 1947 build inclusive secular progressive modern nation learn mistakes one possibly focus group identities rather treating voters individuals We believe led communal voting blocks polarization inevitable emergence majorityminority narrative unhelpful frame almost political conversations today

Metrics driven

We set communicate measure progress tangible measurable goals They include rankings internationally recognized reports

1 World Happiness Report current ranking 122145
2 Human development index current ranking 130189
3 GDP per capita current ranking 120181 per World Bank
4 Education index current ranking 112188
5 Life expectancy current ranking 125183
6 Corruption perceptions index current ranking 78180
7 Global peace index current ranking 136163
8 Press freedom index current ranking 140180
9 Gini coefficient inequality current ranking 99158 per World Bank
10 Gender equality report 87144

We find ways ensure state local equivalents metrics defined monitored measure objective performance PMs CMs local officials find way ensure thirdparty audit numbers gives assurance public transparent honest progress lack progress made fronts We never knowingly present factually incorrect data public

We agnostic respect economic ideology

Capitalism created wealth prosperity many nations general rule would like move liberalized economy believe improve quality citizens country compared government controlled environment However unchecked capitalism create perpetual inequalities society extremely damaging effect environment pollution levels ultimately health life expectancy And therefore believe must state support vulnerable members society state protection environment We make case case decisions therefore based discussion debates pros specific economic policies In cases use data expert advice make decisions best balance competing demands economic growth reducing poverty inequality protecting environment

We committed internal democracy

As party regular elections determine lead party every 5 years There term limits 10 years respect leadership However change manifesto would use 23rds majority 75 quorum party members

National security

We work towards peacefully agreeing internationally recognized borders neighbors  China Pakistan Bangladesh This could bilaterally help external bodies United Nations The final decision unlikely one make everyone happy sides border many lives lost countries want find productive ways engaging neighbors We cross border invade land attack people We improve intelligence defense capabilities order make lack strategic options decision would entail We use torture indefinite imprisonment instrument state policy We continue treat Kashmir integral part India don’t believe plebiscite politically feasible stance party hold India wants get elected Our goal normalize situation respect safety economic growth people Kashmir trust Indian government enough voluntarily vote Section 370 benefit greater integration rest India

Caste reservations

We absolutely stand caste discrimination time believe reservations solution caste discrimination The vast majority jobs informal private sectors reservations don’t apply The government accounts 34 jobs But result controversy percentage jobseducational places reserved entire brand politics emerged focuses reservations cemented caste identities place indefinitely perhaps eternity This led zerosum castebased electoral politics distract issues clean drinking water jobs law order etc And people suffer opinion vulnerable individuals associated lower castes

Over 70 years independence Dalits perhaps among poorest 200 million people world We believe solution caste problem world class primary education When penniless immigrants enter Scandinavian countries children get free education high quality within generation able live lives dignity possibility This along stringent focus ensuring violence individual promptly acted believe sustainable effective solution legacy caste system We also recognize yet politically viable solution many Dalits understandably feel something taken away people community assumption caste prejudices fade away persuasive evidence

Our approach would therefore leave reservations currently exist untouched We would instead focus energy investing education law order till trust levels built among Dalits etc viability pathway buying proposal disbanding reservations system way ending caste system all

Freedom speech standard discourse

We believe freedom speech foundation healthy democracies We work improve Press Freedom Index 140180 We never use jail legal means certainly violence curb individual body criticisms work get elected Even making factually incorrect statements deliberately lying We unscripted unmoderated press conferences major newspapers channels least month subject policies decisions full frank inquiry We restrictions freedom speech exception credible incitement violence deliberate lies defame private individuals businesses

Individuals businesses net assets Rs 1000 crores liable protect defamation except individuals also threshold This prevent rich individuals businesses use expensive lawyers stifle criticism practices common people We believe insulated effects malicious rumors benefit talking corporate industrial corruption openly disproportionate benefit society We work removal blasphemy laws laws seditious antinational speech We believe gods exist country run fairly strong enough withstand criticism We never brand anybody disagrees us antinational assume different idea best people country share views matter

Science business

We make concerted attempt place forefront technological advancements world profit worldclass businesses We want India place contribute technologically superior products like Apple Samsung Nokia Sony We want India place Nobel Prize winners Sciences come We’re fed developing nation We want contributing nation

Further commenting I believe natural resources earth belong equally human ones privileged enough reap monetary gains I think one disagree Billionaire doesnt work employee hisher company Heshe happened make money making others work him

Policy/Economy,What happened BSNL,88,b2flpy,antarikhsha,33,"I think BSNL sabotaged internally profit private companies

 BSNL used good provider telecom services country I remember first telecom company came small town provided good service time relatively cheap reliable It also first 3g provider area
 But somehow quality services went downhill yearsnowadays network goes area frequently due fiber optic cut sometimes something gets stolen tower premises nobody seems care
 Everybody town least one BSNL sim used disruptions everyone got frustrated switched providers
 At time 3g allotment BSNL forced take spectrum circles matching highest bid price circle I dont understand couldnt govt give spectrum free first place After govt entity everybody must known would kill BSNL
 The government didnt even allocate 4g spectrum BSNL like final nail coffin

Edit

 Many looking BSNL separate non government profit entity dont I see publicly owned utility absolute must modern times remote non profitable areas every location country
 BSNL wasnt bad may believe definitely mark like Airtel wasnt bad time never network outage kind cheap It went average worse last decade only
 The argument free spectrum BSNL may seem unfair private companies would accepted truly free market economy never one free market country exists oligarchs used govt whim
 I give example take case India Post PSU well functioning PSU charged license fee operate We perfectly good model shipping courier companies work India work fine alongside IndiaPost Unlike IndiaPosts case telecom spectrum limited resource need barrier entry private companies survived limiting amount services BSNL provide
 Also BSNL wasnt sort bad shape 3g spectrum drama wasnt debt huge reserves tunes 35000 crore govt forcibly took licence fee All policies regarding 3g spectrum allocation wreaked havoc telecom industry BSNL drowned debt PSU incompetent governments policies like private telecom companies
 BSNL management didnt live vacuum perfectly knew 4g coming slow incompetent sabotaged internally act like this
 Its Modi BJP Congress complicit

Policy/Economy,The Husband The Wife The Wife Deserter A Tale Of Triple Talaq,4,c3okk1,iSalaamU,2,"As Triple Talaq Bill verge becoming actual law lets take look triple talaq really heart whole debate 

Triple Talaq something Islam traditionally frowns upon Scholars warned since time immemorial generally strongly disliked Its sole purpose serve remedy really troubled marriages historians believe originally granted Prophet means women married despicable men theyd escape relationship soon possible But often tends happen wellintentioned laws people managed find loopholes favored letter law spirit law And Muslims would absolutely okay illegalization nullification triple talaq towards end

Speaking laws women Islam first religion history given women rights social rights ownership rights inheritance rights marriage rights right initiate divorce right remarry right witness give testimony matters requiring right business Prophets first wife Khadijah wealthy merchant right fight battle many many Fourteen HUNDRED years ago 

But time Muslims twisted teachings Islam suit purpose misused downright violated laws Islam protecting sanctity womens rights And time also became okay rest world somehow always find way judge entirety Muslim community religion based examples set worst Muslims completely unrepresentative Islam Muslims 

Anyway I digress coming back divorce So 1400 years ago Muslim women granted right initiate divorce legal sharia process referred khula This women around world either burned stake wanting rights promise married man seven lives throw pyre died

This normal preferred mode talaq divorce looks like Its supposed done three stages period equaling roughly three months grounds firmly established infidelity adultery betrayal loss affection etc Even normal form divorce meant last resort nothing seems worked save marriage The first month provided grounds divorce major infidelity andor adultery slightest hope reconciliation spouses encouraged find common ground rethink stance second month time reflection possible reconciliation end third month attempts reconciliation clearly failed divorce deemed finalized spouses part ways

Anyway THAT normal approach going divorce Islam And surprise surprise THAT Muslims actually go getting divorce Most Muslims generally hate idea triple talaq Remember supposed absolute lastresort measure Heres report based survey found divorce cases amongst Muslims mere 03 percent identified performed triple talaq Less 1 percent 

httpsindianexpresscomarticleopinioncolumnsunimportanceoftripletalaqsupremecourtmuslimlaw4678304

Yes 03 percent THAT low incidence triple talaq really Let say really sinks ZERO POINT THREE percent 

But many knew Or rather many led believe divorces among Muslims happen triple talaq way Or prevalent among Muslims millions Muslim women simply abandoned husbands within seconds Or Islam encourages Or women simply rights Islam begin 

Many everyone 

That brings us second hidden yet important part discussion politics propaganda Islamophobia aspect 

If could timetravel todays India ten years odds youd find barely recognizable 2019 supposed year year away watershed moment dreamed would forever change nations destiny We going developed happy prosperous nation vision APJ Abdul Kalam come life 

But safe say dream much farther reality today ten years ago And however unrealistic unattainable dream may begin I sure nobody wildest dreams ever imagined India terrorist would elected parliament become lawmaker 2019

A deeply radicalized bigoted easily manipulated religious majority set country back many many years decades Such level toxic propaganda intolerance truth nothing absolutely nothing seems potential stem flow madness anytime soon 

And backdrop became possible man abandoned mother abandoned wife decades ago presided riots saw hundreds women get brutally killed thousands get raped rise messiah Muslim women rights everyone else buy whole charade 

And allowed everyone believe logical solution correct injustice triple talaq jail man three years based report filed almost anyone keep woman measly welfare fund duration keep children far away father thus eventually save marriage 

If still think triple talaq bill present manifestation anything deeply hateful vengeful exercise power punish Muslims well Muslims clearly wrong side history

Policy/Economy,Suddenly ‘one nation one policy’ sentiment overtaking models Interview YV Reddy IAS former RBI Governor 14th Finance Commission Chairman,6,azoh6g,Avinash_Sharma,3,"You said book feeling quarters cooperative federalism replaced coercive federalism What basis comment

Some developments taken place 14th Finance Commission’s FC recommendations Cesses surcharge increased significantly even GST The States felt shortchanged way Centrally Sponsored Schemes CSS restructured increasing share State government put way GST administered The general debate earlier Bihar model competing Gujarat model different States’ models development competing other

Now suddenly “one nation one policy” sentiment overtaking models And Planning Commission forum States also now

Due institutional vacuum Ministries directly dealing CSS So spirit discussion dialogue replaced diktats various Ministries Some say dialogue untypical cooperative federalism

You’ve said States forced share resources CSS After 14th FC recommendations impression Centre devolving States went 32 42

As coauthor GR Reddy explain comparison 32 42 39 became 42 way computations differed This increase offset actions cesses surcharges CSS So virtually advantage States

GR Reddy The 14th FC considered entire revenue account Unlike previous FCs considered even Plan revenue account As result Plan transfers subsumed tax devolution

The difference 14th FC others former away sector specific grants amount 45 total devolution If take two together actual devolution would 39 earlier became 42 Even 3 increase visible neutralised Centre The reality increased matching contribution States CSS done away 6000 model schools started 2011 half way 201516 took decision terminate entire scheme model schools

The entire burden running schools meeting expenditure – capital operational expenditure fallen States

They restructured 66 CSS 22 umbrella schemes So change number CSS schemes All components remained same

Why didn’t States raise issue

We done 15Th FC… communicated Centre done correct

Immediately 14th FC recommendations accepted Hon Prime Minister wrote us saying ‘now States flush funds…’ We wrote back saying absolutely increase flow funds States change composition transfers favour untied transfers Now happened qualitative change transfers States – getting money untied transfers

The total transfers percentage gross revenues States Centre remained level – 49

Aren’t untied transfers desirable It frees States use funds whatever purpose deem fit…

Whatever additional money come untied transfers tied towards meeting additional commitment

In revised pattern CSS put money

You made commitment can’t ‘uncommit’ But changed pattern Whatever untied funds got put schemes

For example 2014 Telangana’s contribution CSS around ₹2000 crore In 201516 change funding patterns gone ₹3500 crore So additional commitment part States

There commitment States termination CSS – model schools scheme example Another BRGF – backward regions grant fund  Telangana State 9 10 districts BRGF They substantially reduced allocations women child welfare also

There view many CSS – money efficiently used

The concern CSS money thinly spread across schemes For example take education health States spending close 80 The Centre supplementing States 20 make much difference That comes conditionalities submission uses visits Central teams delays release funds As result procedures unable fully utilise Centre’s allocations I don’t think State used funds Centre entirely

So solution offer funds allow States free hand

The Commission Dr Reddy recommended – number CSS restricted nationally identified priorities

Dr YV Reddy Basic issue Finance Commission one mechanism essentially meant sharing taxes based formula 8090 transfers States always tax devolution In tax devolution conditions much weight give population census’ population consideration namely fiscal capacity The question weight give If give weight equally efficiency equity cancel sense

You mentioned institutional vacuum Do think NITI Aayog able step plate

There deficiencies way Planning Commission functioned There impression given States go Commission supplicant discussion That weakness corrected In correction process bad habit got rid new system There forum Each Ministry become authority unto able dictate terms States

Is deliberate Aayog power evolve thus

That question mark Whether design default result individual Ministries indicating States means coherent comprehensive view States process

There view terms reference 15th FC may stand test constitutional validity What’s view

There 34 issues It true generated unprecedented reaction Never FC number CMs got together protested Also scholars questioned constitutional validity Terms Reference – example whether need revenue deficit

The constitution provides FC needs decide Third 15th FC asked review 14th FC It continuing process Above Commission asked make recommendations keeping view performance indicators States conform certain policy parameters reflected existing policy Centre

The way FC structured supposed instrument central government’s priorities day So questioned several grounds

Most considerations mentioned ToR necessarily binding FC The Commission choose choose take account But needs courage vision Commission – hoping there

What’s view controversy base date population census 15th FC

The whole question whether correct thing It difficult defend outdated population basis Because FC supposed take account needs State period How 1971 population determine needs State 2021 It undertaken grounds States penalised But States taken action family planning 1971 They don’t get anything It continuing incentive right

This time prescribed 2011 population That also valid The FC recommendations 2020 So estimated population States period 20202025 Ideally stipulation date population left FC one population relevant period

Isn’t GST good example cooperative fiscal federalism

It extraordinary institution commendable It come existence overnight It started informal committee Finance Ministry evolved In implementation dissatisfaction expressed The fact Centre veto increases influence But part game Concerns may way working But institutional set extraordinarily good It good example collaboration cooperation institution Union States

Can replicated areas

Exactly This revenue side On expenditure side fiscal transfers outside FC brought interState council That recommendation 14th FC

The GST Council may replicated good approach build On expenditure side different type collaboration compared revenue side

Is recommendation 15th FC give

Yes The transfers States Centre take FC nonFC routes The 14th FC gave recommendations structure nonFC transfers It’s ambit advice

There three approaches virtually abolish Commission making constitutional amendment say percentage second continuous FC GST Council type mechanism FC gets subsumed third FC design new institutional arrangements technical political consensusbased recommended 14th FC

All provoked partly GST Council positive partly institutional vacuum — pushing us find new institutional mechanisms

Pleasantly surprised functioning GST Council It comprises people varying vote bank compulsions

The consensus result number years effort Consultative process going last 1015 years States also convinced winwin situation sake tax harmonisation across country felt better And also feeling GST better form tax leading better compliance It builds value chain Initially apprehension part manufacturing States may lose destination tax So put place 2 year statutory mechanism compensated period 5 years The states yielded lot space Centre For States VAT constituted 60 old tax revenue They conceded 50 fiscal space Centre whereas space conceded Centre 30 They still get customs duty income tax etc In working still trust deficit voting pattern fully loaded favour Centre almost veto power

Then way GST administered also raising apprehensions minds people treated fairly Centre Like delays apportionment IGST delays payment compensation cess collecting compensation cess required Best thing reduce compensation cess correspondingly So surplus compensation cess lying Centre distributed 5 years It Centre set record straight remove trust deficit

On special category status Andhra Pradesh stand took 14th FC

Special category status jurisdiction FC In book I explained Centre’s version relationship 14th FC recommendation special category

If want simple truth 14th FC make recommendation inclusion exclusion special category The issue according special category status assurance PM given months 14th FC could give recommendations

But government explanation interprets recommendations 14th FC regard special category status I given book It reader decide related

Cess becoming monster administrative system With GST assumed cess won’t longer part system But Kerala disaster cess Isn’t purpose reform lost acts

There calamity fund Centre expected come assistance states things happen always burden sharing can’t anticipate Now recourse cess things unusual

Isnt step away cooperative fiscal federalism The Council telling one state funds needed rebuilding disaster generated within State

That dissenting calling coercive federalism These ‘innovations’ States uncomfortable with

You Kerala upper end social development scale Uttarakhand lower end TN Gujarat Maharashtra higher end economic development index Odisha Bihar How possible central body including FC reconcile differences

That exactly issue regard federation In federation competing considerations You build trust amongst therefore fixed formula That’s operate system

What needed Centre able bring together States treat inequalities calamities national problem Union States participate Problem whenever State opposes Centre accused antinational Being antiunion antinational

There 3 levels debate – State interest Union interest national interest To build national consensus Union States must together If States get feeling Union abrogated sole authority national interest States resent That essence matter

How much strong leader top

You go back Constituent Assembly debates Dr Ambedkar introducing draft constitution discusses merits demerits parliamentary presidential form government says parliamentary system important India He says India essentially undemocratic therefore emphasises continuous accountability He says continuous accountability important stability That deliberate choice type issue

In 14th FC recommended forest cover determinant In five years lapsed studied recommendation helped India’s environment cause

No But it’s interesting area see impact recommendation But logic simple – forest cover The state govt contributing environment cost It cannot use resource maintain So provide The basic principle externalities The state contributing cost – gain anything It incurs cost maintain forest

Essays  March 19 2007  1238

Developing Cultures  Case Studies coedited Peter Berger Laurence Harrison Routledge 2005

Does culture way help explain fact Indian economy stagnating first fifty years 20th century began grow respectable clip 1980 amongst fastest growing world end century

Consider following hundred year trend 1900 1950 Indian economy grew average 08 percent year population also grew rate thus net growth income per capita nil rightly called colonial economy stagnant After Independence economic growth picked 35 percent 1950 1980 population growth 22 percent hence net affect income 13 percent per capita mournfully referred “the Hindu rate growth” Things began change modest liberalization eighties annual economic growth rose 56 percent This happy trend continued reform decade nineties growth averaged 62 percent year population slowed 18 percent thus per capita income rose decent 44 percent year

As benchmark recall Wests industrial revolution took place 3 percent GDP growth 11 percent per capita income growth 1820 To appreciate magnitude Indian change 1980 let illustrate If Indias per capita GDP continued growing pre1980 level income would reached present American capita income levels 2250 continues grow post1980 rate reach levels 2066 gain 184 years

How one begin explain Indias economic performance past hundred years The Indian nationalist blames first fifty years stagnation British colonialism But trade economist counter showing world economy also stagnant first half 20th century especially World War I world per capita GDP grew annually one percent2 The main culprits would say conflict autarky Disgraceful protectionism governments Wars slowed world Indian economy

Although Indian economy picked 1950 neoclassical economist would argue performed world economy experienced “golden age” driven trade expansion 1971 Like rest Third World India benefit global trade expansion closed economy pursued import substitution Moreover Nehrus socialism shackled economy fierce controls private sector pejoratively called Licence Raj hence annual GDP growth 15 percentage points even Third World average 1950 19803

This changed dramatically modest liberal reforms 1980s sweeping ones 1990s Indian economy integrated world In twenty years outperformed world economy significantly amongst fastest world4 Thus gradual technological diffusion rising capital accumulation productivity gradual education expansion help economists explain good deal story There also value time accumulated learning time “Collective learning” Hayeks term applied cumulative experience generations build embodied language technology way things5

But economic explanations enough That India adopted democracy 1950 capitalism 1991 also significant democracys redistributive pressures free power farmers subsidies dampened growth also explain Indias reform process painfully slow Economists also find puzzling liberal institutions British Raj engender faster growth colonial years The rule law relative peace Pax Brittanica nondirigiste administration railways canals—all market friendly moves all

I believe national confidence also plays important role The damaging impact colonialism may well Indian minds—it created inferiority complex recently recovered Douglass North rightly emphasized importance beliefs6Businessmen understand value confidence entrepreneurial success creating climate investment Historians emphasize power selfbelief national successRoman history Britains rise 19th century examples After Independence Indias confidence certainly rose especially democracy took root flawed economic institutions Nehruvian socialism damaged confidence Once socialist institutions began replaced capitalist ones Reform period confidence returned young Indian minds finally became decolonized I traveled extensively across India 1990s I discovered changed mood I think also explains current economic success7

I shall amplify arguments taking reader galloping tour Indian economic history From story I shall draw lessons role institutions culture development En passant I shall touch upon great questions Indian history British impoverish India Why didnt railways engender industrial revolution Did Nehrus socialism dampen Indias progress What consequence democracy preceding capitalism

Lets begin Mughals

Indias nationalist historians portrayed precolonial economy golden age prosperity fabulous wealth set Europeans great voyages discovery8 During Mughal Empire end 16th century Indias wealth indeed sustain 100 million people With plenty arable land agriculture certainly productive Western Europes even subsistenceoriented peasant got decent return9 India also large skilled workforce produced cotton also luxuries aristocracy Consequently economy produced large financial surplus used support growing Mughal Empire finance spectacular monuments like Taj Mahal10

In 1497 Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama flotilla four ships find Indias wealth But twoyear voyage commercial success Indians interested European clothes goods made far ones India But Da Gama told King Manuel Portugal large cities large buildings rivers great populations He spoke spices jewels precious stones “mines gold” He believed found Indias legendary wealth11

It took English hundred years discover wealth Initially came plunder soon discovered rewards trade They found India produced worlds best cotton yarn textiles enormous quantities12 What Indians wanted exchange Europeans gold silver insatiable appetite Hence constant flow gold India absorbed good deal bullion mined Spaniards New World Having learned cotton textiles India English turned tables brought industrial revolution Britain destroyed lives millions Indian weavers

India leading manufacturer 18th century

India leading manufacturing country world early 18th century It 226 percent share worlds GDP came around 16 percent 1820 closer share world population13 It developed banking system vigorous merchant capital network agents brokers middlemen Given enormous financial surplus skilled artisan class large exports plenty arable land reasonable productivity question didnt modern industrial economy emerge India Instead India become impoverished

Despite dynamic growing commercial sector responded market forces extensive foreign trade truth 18th century India significantly behind Western Europe technology institutions ideas Neither agricultural revolution scientific revolution occurred long run manual skill Indian artisan could substitute technological progress”14 and would needed new attitudes Notwithstanding surplus trade mideighteenth India “per capita product perhaps twothirds England France”15

There easy answer problem country prosperous people poor One explanation even 18th century India large population plenty cheap labor Prosperity comes rising productivity rise productivity depends technology When supply labor elastic economical hire people invest machines Hence Englishman observed 1807 “In India seldom attempt made accomplish anything machinery performed human labour”16 There easy answer problem country prosperous people poor One explanation even 18 century India large population plenty cheap labor Prosperity comes rising productivity rise productivity depends technology When supply labor elastic economical hire people invest machines Hence Englishman observed 1807 “In India seldom attempt made accomplish anything machinery performed human labour”

Did British Raj impoverish India

Indias nationalist historians blamed British Raj Indias poverty The classic nationalist case India rich British came colonialism weakened agriculture “deindustrialized” India throwing millions artisans work Britains trade policies encouraged import manufactures export raw materials finally drained wealth India transferring capital Britain

Nationalists claimed Lancashires new textile mills crushed Indias handloom textile industry threw millions weavers work Indias textile exports plunged leadership position start Britains Industrial Revolution fraction The indigenous banking system financed exports also destroyed Since colonial government erect tariff barriers Indian consumers shifted cheaper English millmade cloth millions handloom workers left misery British colonial rule “deindustrialised” India favorite nationalist phrase exporter textiles India became exporter raw cotton17

Britain also changed old land revenue system disadvantage farmer pay revenue whether monsoon failed This led famines The worst one 189697 affected 96 million lives killed estimated 5 million people Although railways helped trade food crops enlarged national market sucked away peasants surplus earlier stored bad years Moreover British government transferred surplus revenues back England Since India consistently exported imported second half 19th century early 20th century Britain used Indias trade surplus finance trade deficit rest world pay exports India capital repayments London This represented massive drain Indias wealth18

In recent years historians challenged nationalist picture They argued Indian industrys decline 19th century caused technology The machines Britains industrial revolution wiped Indian textiles way traditional handmade textiles disappeared Europe rest world Fifty years later Indian textile mills would destroyed Indias weavers thus victims technological obsolescence19

They also found land tax exorbitant—by 1900 5 percent agricultural output half average per capita tax burden There “drain wealth” 15 percent GNP every year The revisionist historians argued Indias payments Britain real military civilian services service capital investments Also overhead cost British establishment—the called “home charges”—was fact quite small20 If India army navy would spent True India balance payments surplus Britain used finance part deficit India compensated import gold silver went private Indian hands

India begins reindustrize

Indian entrepreneurs began set modern textile mills 1850 slowly began recapture domestic market In 1896 Indian mills supplied 8 total cloth consumed India 1913 20 1936 62 1945 7621Although India participate global trade expansion 1870 1913 Indian businessmen made large profits First World War reinvested war Thus Indias manufacturing output grew 56 percent per year 191338 well world average 33 percent” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection 1920s helped industrialists expand diversify

By Independence 1947 Indian entrepreneurs strong position buy businesses departing British Industrys share Indias GNP doubled 38 percent 1913 75 percent 1947 share manufactures exports rose 224 percent 1913 30 percent 1947

Why didnt industrial revolution occur

One intriguing questions history India failed create industrial revolution Karl Marx predicted railways would transform India usher industrial revolution Indeed First World War thought ready takeoff By 1914 India third largest railway network worlds largest jute manufacturing industry fourth largest cotton textile industry largest canal system 25 percent world trade23Although colony liberal regulatory regimefar investor friendly one replaced Independence—and 1920s infant industry also favored tariffs It merchant class hungry become industrialists Industrialization fact pick War industrys share national output doubled But enough broadly transform agricultural society Modern industry employed 25 million people population 350 million

Amiya Kumar Bagchi Marxist economist suggests reason lack effective demand colonial period limited business opportunity Indians poor buy modern goods services24 If domestic Indian market small couldnt entrepreneur supplemented producing export Morris D Morris blames supply constraints25 An Indian entrepreneur uncompetitive shortage technology skilled labor capital—all raised cost production The historian Rajat Ray argues Indian businessmen export made inferior products unacceptable world market In view technological backwardness single biggest failing26 But surely could imported technology Jamshedji Tata GD Birla others did

Unlike nationalist historians I think British conspiracy deliberately underinvest India sabotage Indian business interests Bombays textile mills built credit technical assistance machines Britain although competitive threat Manchesters mills I believe industrial revolution occur Indian agriculture remained stagnant cannot industrial revolution without agricultural surplus means feed rapidly growing urban population second international trading environment turned hostile protectionism First World War followed Depression third colonial government educate masses unlike Japanese state finally colonial mindset pervaded Indian middle classeven hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence politically enslaved

What verdict British rule

Did British impoverish India There question 18th century plundered looted Indias wealth conquerors done history But create ongoing institutions Indias detriment This nature theory colonialism True Industrial Revolution threw millions weavers work would happened way new technology reached India British government policy could cushioned impact erecting trade barriers saved enormous amount human suffering protecting handlooms would temporary palliative

Odd may seem I believe Britain “exploit” India enough Had made massive investments India Americas India would become prosperous much bigger market British goods A richer India would better customer better supplier firmer basis Empire27 Britains main failure educate Indian masses—hence 83 percent Indians illiterate Independence Britains education system India produced thin upper crust extremely well educated Indians masses remained illiterate28

Although Britain could lift Indians poverty avert famines give India institutions democracythe rule law independent judiciary free press It built railways canals harbors It gave India almost hundred years peace—the Pax Britannica Although gave modern values institutions interfere ancient traditions religion Hence India preserved spiritual heritage old way life continues Many despair divisiveness caste hold Indian way life also bulwark onslaught global culture

Independence License Raj

After Independence democracy took root India gradually masses acquired stake system periodically electing representatives even lowest castes The rulers also adopted Fabian socialist economic path Indians turn capitalism 1991 although modest liberalization economy 1980s Thus India embraced democracy capitalism makes journey modernity unique explains good deal

Jawaharlal Nehru planners trust private entrepreneurs made state entrepreneur surprisingly failed create industrial revolution Instead India experienced agricultural revolution early 1970s It thus important precondition industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but industrial takeoff eluded Its investment rate also rose 6 percent well 20 per cent yet engender takeoff Why

I think least six things wrong Indias mantra one adopted inwardlooking importsubstituting path rather outwardlooking exportpromoting route thus denied share world trade prosperity trade brought postWar era Two set massive inefficient monopolistic public sector denied autonomy working hence investments productive poor capitaloutput ratio Three overregulated private enterprise worst controls world diminished competition market four discouraged foreign capital denied benefits technology world class competition Five pampered organized labor point extremely low productivity Six ignored education children

Nehrus strategic planner PC Mahalanobis made two wrong assumptions He assumed opportunities rapid export expansion 1950s turned wrong India discovered tiny Hong Kong could earn exports whole India Indias share world trade declined 22 percent 1947 05 percent 1990 He also assumed competition wasteful also flawed idea little improvement productivity without it

Even damaging creeping controls private sector The bizarre licensing system It began Industrial Licensing Act 1951 required entrepreneur get license set new unit expand change product mix A huge number untrained clerks engineers bureaucrats Directorate General Technical Development operating basis inadequate information vetted thousands applications ad hoc basis These low level functionaries took months futile microreview application finally sent approval administrative ministry The ministry lost months reviewing data sent application interministerial licensing committee After Ministers approval investor seek approval import machinery capital goods licensing committee If finance needed State financial institution scrutiny repeated afresh The result enormous delays sometimes lasting years staggering opportunities corruption

Large business houses set parallel bureaucracies Delhi follow files organize bribes win licenses If entrepreneur finally get started made success enterprise trouble It offence punishable law manufacture beyond capacity granted license India became country world production sorely needed goods sorely punishable law29

The system ended thwarting competition entrepreneurship growth without achieving social objectives It fostered monopolies proliferated uneconomicsize plants remote uncompetitive locations employing secondrate technology Bureaucrats clue basics running business made decisions choice technology size location plants

Although becoming clear India wrong path late sixties instead changing course Nehru Indira Gandhi introduced controls She nationalized banks discouraged foreign investment placed hurdles domestic enterprise Hence industrial growth plunged 77 per cent year 19511965 40 per cent 19661980 Productivity Indian manufacturing declined half percent year 1960 198530

“19661980 effectively dark period Indian economy”31 It harder blame Nehru adopting economic wrong model socialism wisdom age dozens economists visited India hailed bold experiment32 It right blame Indira Gandhi Japans miracle evident Korea Taiwan following footsteps However ideology one part story An important reason nonperformance poor implementation Even Nehrus socialism could delivered degenerate “License Raj”

India Reforms

Although modest liberalization 1980s decisive turning point came July 1991 minority government Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms It opened economy foreign investment trade dismantled import controls lowered customs duties devalued currency made rupee convertible trade account virtually abolished licensing controls private investment dropped tax rates broke public sector monopolies As result growth rose 75 percent year three years row midnineties inflation came 13 percent 6 percent 1993 exchange reserves shot 1 billion 20 billion 1993 crossed 100 billion end 2003 This important turning point Dengs revolution China December 1978 Surprisingly elected coalition governments succeeded Rao continued reform process despite slow incremental pace made India one fastest growing major economies world33

Indians traditionally accorded high place making money Hence merchant bania placed third fourcaste hierarchy behind brahmin kshatriya step ahead laboring shudra After economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable sons brahmins kshatriyas began get MBAs wanted become entrepreneurs The business pages newspapers became livelier chief ministers states scrambled private investment judges became evenhanded industrial disputes As result India midst social revolution rivalled perhaps ascent Japans merchant class 1968 Meiji Restoration

There also mental revolution And changed attitude English illustrates new mindset Ever since British left Indians constantly carped English language But 1990s carping seemed die quietly without ceremony English became one Indian languages English lost colonial stigma oddly enough around time Hindu nationalists came power Young Indians new middle class think English skill like Windows This Hinglish Hindi mixed English spreading Encouraged flourishing private television channels supported advertisers newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace uninhibited hybrid Hindi English popular idiom bazaar rushing socioeconomic ladder The purists naturally disapprove people comfortable accepting today Indians relaxed confident people Their minds become decolonized

The world meanwhile also changed industrial information economy seemed speak Indias advantage symbolized success software business process outsourcing These “Bangalores” given Indians confidence reflect new social contract The new entrepreneurs inherit wealth risen back talent hard work professional skills A new selfbelief emerged among urban youth doesnt need approval others especially West Music composers like AR Rehman display exuberant nonchalance new young Bollywood pop stars So new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy designers fashion clothes beauty queens cricket stars

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains great deal Indian economy stagnating first half 20th century went become one fastest growing end century It tells us example disgraceful protectionism governments interwar years first half 20th century dampened world trade slowed world Indian economies It also explains India performed world average 19501980 thinking trade impoverished colonial period India closed economy denied fruits “golden period” world trade 1950 1970 “License Raj” institutions Nehrus socialism also suppressed growth Finally neoclassical economics explains dismantling controls integrating economy global economy Indian economy become competitive growing rapidly reforms

But whole story must turn institutions attitudes understand incentive structure Indian society60 Indians blame colonialism impoverishing But seen colonialism complex tale For example deindustrialize India nationalists argued handloom textiles died India world technological obsolescence Colonialisms bigger damage loss Indian confidence inhibited Indian entrepreneurs This confidence began grow Gandhis freedom movement first half 20th century industrialization pick However impact society insufficient create industrial revolution

After Independence Indias confidence certainly rose democracy took root flawed economic institutions Nehruvian socialism acted damper Once socialist institutions began replaced capitalist ones Reform period selfassurance returned Indian marketplace Todays mood India opposite existed hundred years ago Insecurity inferiority filled colonial India apparent writings Bengali writers 19th century Bankim Chandra Chatterji Today writers like Salman Rushdie Arundhati Roy exhibit matter fact assuredness almost cool reflection changed national mindset

India embraced democracy first capitalism afterwards made difference India became fullfledged democracy 1950 universal suffrage extensive human rights 1991 opened free play market forces For rest world way around In West suffrage extended gradually last century mass political parties developed democracy began impinge capitalist institutions practices

Indias democracy overwhelming majority poor voters70 per cent still live rural areas organized labor constitutes less 10 per cent total labor middle class around 20 per cent population Because democratic pressures India tried redistribute pie baked It set intricate regulatory networks private economy transformed rural industrial society It began think terms “welfare” welfaregenerating jobs The result seen throttling enterprise slow growth missed opportunities It price India paid democracy capitalism—or rather much democracy enough capitalism

Since politics short run game growth long run one never situation completely optimal This explains Indian politicians bother education results take long time come When politician promises rice two rupees kilo costs five rupees market wins election Since mid1960s politicians vigorously competed giving away free goods services voters When politicians money come creating schools improving old ones Indias damaging fiscal deficit around 10 percent GDP center states combined testimonial downside competitive politics teaches demand publicly provided goods services insatiable democracy

But Indias problems governance go far beyond need appease interests The weakening democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi 1970s caused widespread corruption political violence populist giveaways paralysis problem solving Conspicuously absent disciplined party organizations help leaders democracies mobilize support specific programs Hence excessive reliance personal appeal individual leaders win elections When power leaders tend take easy way act all

Will capitalism cousin globalization succeed establishing comfortable place India The answer depends ability deliver prosperity broadly It also depends leaders government business champion classic liberal premises free trade competition It needs leaders come say 1 people fare well competitive market place 2 winners far outnumber losers 2 capitalist democracy best arrangement found 4 globalization good thing great leap forward history My fear capitalisms success India threatened much leftists protectionists timidity defenders

The curious historic inversion democracy capitalism means Indias path future evolving daily dialogue conservative forces caste religion village leftist Nehruvian socialist forces dominated intellectual life country 40 years new forces global capitalism These “million negotiations democracy” slow pace economic reforms also mean India might stable peaceful negotiated transition future say China It might also avoid deleterious side effects unprepared capitalist society Russia Although slower India likely preserve way life civilization diversity tolerance spirituality onslaught global culture

Does culture matter

Cultural explanations vigorous industry India hundred years Colonial officials routinely blamed Indias poverty otherworldly spirituality Hindu life fatalistic beliefs Max Weber attributed absence development caste system Gunnar Myrdal Swedish economist found Indias social system attitudes important cause “low level equilibrium” low productivity primitive production techniques low levels living34

Deepak Lal another economist similarly explained economic stagnation low level “Hindu equilibrium” around caste system bought stability context political warfare monsoon failure climatic uncertainty labor shortage undervalued merchant class35 David Landes historian blames enervating heat deleterious work For reason rich countries lie temperate zones poor tropics semitropics36

While institutions culture matter undoubtedly skeptical national stereotypes easy cultural explanations sort common hundred years ago In experience successful Hindu entrepreneurs extremely otherworldly religion aggressive business The Indian farmer despite caught caste system responds quickly market based incentives Green Revolution testifies Brahmins supposed contempt manual labor plough land vigorously And Rajput Thakurs never worked living shed feudal ways sake commercial opportunity Moreover substantial nonHindus India communities also stuck rut stagnation Other Asian countries equally backward “Hindu equilibrium” explain away stagnation Finally Indians migrate countries perform better

Thus I uncomfortable “otherworldly values Hindus” “immobilizing effects caste system” “conservative habits merchant caste” I believe Sir John Hicks Economic Principle trump cases It states “people would act economically opportunity advantage presented would take it”37 It explains diffusion Green Revolution across India also demographic transitions currently underway many states

When seeking explanation nations wealth poverty preferred method begin economic factors proximate causes motivate businessman investthe size market capability suppliers distribution hurdles state competition If satisfy I seek answers institutions course intimately tied culture I found institutions evolve rapidly incentives change society transferred fairly quickly example 1990s India able dismantle many institutions Nehruvian socialism replace capitalist institutions Finally none factors provide satisfactory explanation I turn attitudes social structure

I find Deepak Lalls distinction material cosmological beliefs useful38The material beliefs civilization ways making living subject economics cosmological ones live realm culture The rise west accompanied change sets beliefs East Asias success needed mainly change material beliefs—it become prosperous without losing soul In words possible modernize without westernizing Ever since British Raj material beliefs changing India unlike cosmological beliefs

Our continuing inability distinguish “modern” “western” India surely cause grief If could accept great deal modern western culture especially material beliefs Wests property universal critical way thinking belongs rational human beings We would waste energies swadeshi protectionism hindutva preserving ancient Hindu civilization futile language debates “remove English primary schools” The debate modernisation westernisation begun early nineteenth century Ram Mohan Roy continues rage India At root fear loss Indian way life The older generation fears young whose minds decolonised confident adopting Wests material beliefs without fearing loss cosmological ones

Policy/Economy,Economics That I support BJP  NDA,132,2ta4um,Podaaaanga,156,"Every second day thread Why educated people support fount communal poison BJP Instead us endlessly circle jerking subjective stuff I wanted take slightly different approach put forth key macro economic indicators compare data NDA I era UPA I  II regimes I even plotted graphs excel imgur wont allow upload excel graphs I idea upload onto Reddit otherwise ideas welcome Also one make tables Reddit Copy pasting excel work

The Data 

Indicator	        NDA	     UPA I	       UPA II
Agriculture    278	    307	       410
Industry	      580	    910       510
Services	      760	    990	      809

On GDP growth rates nothing much choose though UPA seems done well across sectors wa achieved I cover little later

Indicator	NDA	UPA I	UPA II
CAD	340	1312	5658

On CAD UPA performance looks horrible one could attribute increasing oil prices touched peak  100 barrel certain extent portion CAD went horribly
 
Indicator	        NDA	UPA I	UPA II
Inflation WPI	458	59	         708
Inflation CPI	386	604	1018

Inflation seems horribly mismanaged UPA largely due deficit financing pumping huge funds rural sector form MNREGA The MNREGA larger picture actually bad intended recipients drove prices hurt economy whole

Indicator	       NDA	UPA I	UPA II
Fiscal Deficit	38	3086	76

Again UPA achieve funding profligate schemes MNREGA Food Safety Act loan waiver By deficit financing It essentially spent govts usually earned This also side effect fueling inflation

And come I believe even numbers illusionary

Absolute Increase Employment mn	NDA	UPA
Agriculture	                                              2125      1571
Manufacturing	                                              1172	723
Non Manufacturing	                                        911	2614
Services	                                                      1877	048
Total	                                                       6085	272

The net jobs added NDA 10 years compared UPA 12 data 2013 available  even comparable I believe UPA growth illusory  jobless growth

Factor 10 million unemployed people hitting workforce every year imperative nation find jobs them

Another factor I would liked compare data available prior 2008 I leave scope mention This indicator Gross Fixed Capital Formation infrastructure The NDA well know focussed lot infrastructure roads highway network chief amongst The NDA added roads 5 years 30 years governments combined Without govt massively investing actual infrastructure job creation economic growth going difficult manage

This new either UPA mismanagement Indira Gandhi pretty much thing She created import fueled bubble illusory growth broke quickly fueled massive inflation Windows Opportunity Memoirs Economic Adviser Krishnaswamy goes detail Indira almost wrecked national economy recklessly devaluing currency sending inflation soaring 75 late 60s Indira also established trend socialistic economy father piloted Mixed economy ruthlessly nationalising every industry coal banking wheat imposing draconian restrictions private sector Indira ALSO failed focus infrastructure first regime cut investment infrastructure

After Nehru well guide Indian economy given set challenges every succeeding Gandhi dynast absolute disaster national economy 

The problem Gandhi  Congress way caught almost every major party follows dead approach populsim throwing sops election time forgetting even basic economics

Subjective opinion In BJP I see party serious building infrastructure serious creating jobs populist marries populism sense pragmatism It arguably party right sees merit manufacturing workhorse Indian economy I see BJP method worked relative India course places like Chatisgarh MP Gujarat Goa Yes failed Karnataka yet resilience learn apply lessons throw dynast scion continue tired old politics

Sloganeering empty tokenism sops wont work without hard reforms something BJP established track record I support BJP

When born republic Constitution drafted one tallest leaders land could foresee problem ail even today BR Ambedkar warned us divide divide caste rich poor The recent Oxfam Report Inequality India testament Somewhere along line failed bridge divide

We progressed indubitably failed progress collectively Poverty hunger still ails weakest among us I remember watching one video Raghav Bahl mentioned India mixed economy actually got worst worlds Ours capitalist economy even Indiras 42nd amendment isnt socialist economy either

I Rahul fanboy I supported Modi voted BJP I concur Rahuls tweet announces MIG says cannot build new India millions brothers  sisters suffer scourge poverty

While happening India west USA Democrats making comeback recently back House diverse bunch Reps putting leash meglomaniac President The hotly debated topic eyesore Fox News AOCs 70 Marginal Tax Rate campaigned probably take forward

All three events happening time I see debate India Our divide growing cannot collectively grow take care poor weakened ones Here interesting statistic

I understand say Ambani ultra rich people notional wealth lies stocks This capitalistic thought factually correct time incomplete Ambanis wealth lies RILs stocks STOCKS PAY DIVIDENDS Ambani according reporthttpswwwbloombergquintcombusinessmukeshambanisdividendincomefromrelianceindustriestrumpshissalary made Rs 14553 crore dividend stake company last 10 years  Rs 1804 crore 2018 alone salary Rs 15 crore annually

So yeah cannot build new India millions brothers sisters suffer scourge poverty MIG sure hell seems nice idea talking execution right taxing ultra rich like AOC says cannot ruled India well This India probe Mars rank 103 119 countries Global Hunger Index divide real

Policy/Economy,The identity crisis Middle India,138,63dbev,conqueror_of_destiny,185,"It often said India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru last Englishman rule India The saying carries element truth Nehru may born Allahabad heart lay Shires Oxbridge This showed language cultural sensibilities overall parliamentary democracy guided us towards He towering intellect unlike contemporaries large bilingual intellectuals writings mainly English He could give speech Hindi knowledge tongue ended His sensibilities English credit English upper class could mingle anyone classes masses country diverse India

One Nehru’s primary concerns Independence building national identity India British loose confederation states recognized paramountcy British people subscribed vague sense ‘Indianness’ never formally defined Nor definition even required The Tamil far south unconcerned Punjabi far north Bengali Gujarati As far common man concerned mainly subscribed less set cultural values There really concept political union called India Indeed idea country called India born independence dissolution British raj However dissolution British Raj also brought partition communal horrors The lack common identity Hindu Muslim tore harmonious communities apart Nehru contemporaries realized fabric held nation together frayed edges would soon tear apart It utmost importance therefore cultivate common identity Indianness suppress alternate cultural regional identity

We part identity formation whether took form singing national anthem every morning school learning names various far flung rivers nation And large succeeded A Tamilian today cheers “Enga thalai Dhoni” man Ranchi Jharkhand much fervor Punjabi Bengali Gujarati A common identity built little talk separatism Indian heartland What separatism exists literally pushed fringes nation verge fizzling The political unification India success

Culturally though remain diverse ever unified identity something neither attainable desirable In many areas India language remains prickly subject quite common hear diatribes linguistic minorities speak language native area stay However even problem communication resolved great gift Empire English language If two people country’s opposite extremes converse would use English language great effect Indeed even resulted amalgamated language called ‘Inglish’ created cultural identity linguistic space own

Socially diverse must said divided ever Perhaps present time past near ancient India always divided society The caste system effectively divides us haves havenots havenots outnumber haves large sum The havenots virtue numbers bottom pyramid haves right top This caste based division society often reflected economic sphere well The upper castes cases well The lower castes tend among poorer downtrodden sections society Consequently aspirations haves vastly different aspirations lower half pyramid This social pyramid template every society since beginning time The upper classes middle classes lower classes various times dominant separately composition remains pretty much When aspirations one classes met society experience upheaval In case lower classes revolution For others upheaval takes form flight greener pastures It upheaval India facing today

The Indian state past sixty years done decent though means complete job providing basic I must stress word basic aspirations lower rungs pyramid The Roti Kapada aur Makaan taken care many Indians Food security achieved quite ago housing situation bad Again I must remind reader much done good deal coverage area In case better citizen nation Roti Kapada aur Makaan always taken care It something else aspires These aspirations may take form entertainment social standing certain lifestyle even choice clothing It matter debate whether aspirations fulfilled Certainly cities India hold ingredients provide aspirations And yet seen urban youth flocked greener pastures abroad like migratory wildebeest The logical conclusion case aspirations urban youth changed aspirations something Indian society cannot fulfill

And aspirations urban educated elite nation Certainly education employment readily available Admission IITNIT barring educational institute similar standing within reach A degree Engineering guarantees every one gainful employment salary ensure comfortable lifestyle Some go post graduate degree diploma management business administration A resume containing lead comfortable lifestyle excellent prospects young Indian eye future And yet sufficient ensure take flight greener pastures What greener pastures aspire to

Everyone heard brain drain 70’s 80’s Educated Indians fled abroad huge numbers stymied lack opportunities land It great loss yes one could understand left India days socialist paroxysm The licensequotapermit Raj Nehru set stifled creativity business enterprise Jobs hard come economy ‘Hindurateofgrowth’ result doctors engineers scientists fled country US helping build societies Today however nation better poised provide employment opportunities engineers doctors And yet continue leave droves What opportunities looking for

Nehru tried hard build common identity nation Today nearly fifty years death hard say succeeded There political cultural union called India There also growing population youth hardly even identifies nation people culture anymore They identify West And search identity surge westwards increasing numbers every year

When I asked wished leave nation I received many replies Some insightful well thought purely cynical selfish though unbeknownst person concerned

One worshipper Western way rational thought spoke raptures technological industrial prowess glowingly described plans build magnetically levitated high speed rail system He noted nation fed housed educated twenty five years “backward shithole invent anything note” thus conveniently discarding fact took United States hundred years reach India still suffering birth pangs

A young lady acquaintance described India selfish repressed society bullies could counted upon elect capable Prime Minister She “sick way use age old methods cannot integrated modern society Must taught even respect equally” She right extent But doubtful would ever find society respects equally bullying tolerated parochial narrow minded sense It also took self control keep reminding Donald Trump elected powerful office world

The real reason one loathe acknowledge longer identify people around anymore Indeed vast majority Indians invisible make appearance lives disgusted feel alienated They would rather acknowledge presence whose aspirations merely survive sit bar whole day drink beer discuss latest happenings International politics Fed relentless diet Americana identify Indian events Indian characters Indian food drink even Indians anymore The television shows watch American The food eat American The books read American The language comfortable American The news channels familiar show local American news Indeed would know political system USA nation  The latest agendas latest Senatorial candidates would fingertips What would minds names MP’s MLA’s back home

One absurd things I heard recent times news socialist elected Seattle city council That socialist elected USA absurd enough But makes news even absurd fact candidate campaigned socialist platform Indian raised India educated India likelihood beneficiary post liberalization reforms Government India Like everyone else generation would first demand reforms lifting India’s socialist policies yet emigrated US rediscovered socialist could bear see suffering American masses yoke capitalism It reeks hypocrisy Would thing India No In India candidate would triumphantly pointed benefits liberalization campaigned right wing party merely reforms benefitted tiny group elites reside top pyramid expense bottom But course even exist Instead chose fight American’s Roti Kapada aur Makaan – “ It easier convince 300 million literate people vote convince 1 billion illiterate people never mind people” There word describe people It ‘mercenary’ But expect people would rather celebrate Halloween Holi

It easier convince three hundred million literates vote It far difficult people convince one billion Indians countrymen vote even speak language Indeed even make effort learn mothertongue identify rest society This laziness push achieve something points deeper malaise psyche In words generation Indians ‘Aspirations Ambitions’ They feel apart world around would rather run away West anything society gave birth cannot satisfy outsize American aspirations And would They Americans name

TLDR  Our urban youth emigrate culturally American even identify Indian anymore",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/63dbev/the_identity_crisis_of_middle_india/

Policy/Economy,Debunked Do maths Indias first bullet train isnt free cost Modi claims  lazy journalist,96,717dlb,fsm_vs_cthulhu,45,"The article question httpwwwbusinessstandardcomarticleeconomypolicydothemathindiasfirstbullettrainisntfreeofcostasmodiclaims1170918001161html

Scumbag journalist 

Writes article saying Do math Does math

Faulty Basic Assumptions

A look JP¥  IN₹ exchange rate last 5 yearshttpsimgurcomNcmqjkW fluctuating around ₹06 JP¥1 part Heres longer detailed view last decadehttpsimgurcomtOxvgAM While spikes lows average seems sticking around 06 Rupees per Yen 

While Japans Inflation Rate trend graph certainly quite flat averaged last decade average remains nearzero Indias inflation rate trending downwards past decade accelerated downwards last 5 yearshttpsimgurcomSoCXbPi

The author seems correlate difference inflation exchange rate two actually linked directly For instance Indias inflation rates years 2009 2010 steep 1497 947 respectively During years Japans inflation rates 167 040 respectively The Yen actually increased value Rupee dropped value within respective domestic markets Yet exchange rate January 2009 till January 2011 2 full yearshttpsimgurcomDHgubGX remained relatively steady somewhere 0485  0550 average range 0065 One would expect see massive increase exchange rate one yen able buy significantly rupees But case So value currency international markets little domesticallyperceived inflation country

Another factor considered interest rate 01 may appear free Indian perspective Japan

Has author even considered scenarios winwin That economics zerosum game This deal great Japan It also good India 

So since author lazy schmuck heres actual math

We currently getting Japan invest USD 17 Billion project

Since author concerned exchange rates thats JP¥ 189 trillion  Which currently ₹ 109 trillion 

Note While writing I used figures like JP¥ 1892 tr ₹ 1093 tr calculations rounded last digit editing text order avoid visual confusion 4digit years like 1967 2067 etc So calculation precise looks

Over 50 years 01 interest rates amount payable end 2067 would JP¥ 199 trillion If current exchange rate remain constant would ₹ 115 trillion But assuming peak exchangerate last 10 years ie 071872  July 2012 India would repaying ₹ 143 trillion Thats STILL interest rate less 054 assuming loaned us entire amount Rupees instead Yen

So effectively worst case scenario got loan trillion rupees 50 years 05 interest rate

Now heres authors argument lack math turned head

Assuming 0 inflation Japan value currency repaid Yen equally valuable 50 years would paid JP¥ 199 trillion upfront So arent losing anything time Thats great them

But seeing Indias inflation assumed significantly 0 value ₹ 143 trillion repayment amount 2067 actually lower perceived within India Remember domestic inflation doesnt translate directly exchange rates So even YenRupee exchange rate becomes horribly high domestic inflation would actually cushion sum would pay 

Still dont get Okay try 

Heres reallife example using real data past

 I used link calculation exchange ratehttpfxtopcomencurrencyconverterpastphpA1093C1JPYC2INRDD01MM01YYYY1967B1PI1btnOKGo21
 I used link calculate inflationhttpfxtopcomeninflationcalculatorphpA6139C1JPYINDICEJPCPI2010DD101MM102YYYY11970DD201MM202YYYY22017btnOKComputeactualvalue

Lets forget trillions simplicity

Say Grandpa took loan JP¥ 189200 50 years ago 1967 01 interest rate value Rupees ₹ 3942 Today need repay loan 50 years You need pay back JP¥ 198900 According present exchangerate comes ₹ 115600

Now back Grandpas day ₹ 1156 lot money You could easily pay rent 2 months ₹ 100 In 1967 ₹ 100 average monthly salary India ₹ 1156 would nearly full years salary back Today ₹ 1156 pay 2 large pizzas In 1967 Coke ₹ 005 meaning could buy 23120 bottles Coke ₹ 1156 Today buy 115 bottles Coke amount original small glass bottles India experienced cumulative inflation 4000 last 50 years Paying back ₹ 1156 today feels equivalent paying back ₹ 3025 back 1967httpfxtopcomeninflationcalculatorphpA3025C1INRINDICEINCPI1958DD118MM109YYYY11967DD219MM209YYYY22017btnOKComputeactualvalue

Meanwhile Japan value JP¥ 198900 today dropped third 1967 value worth JP¥ 62000 timehttpfxtopcomeninflationcalculatorphpA6139C1JPYINDICEJPCPI2010DD101MM102YYYY11970DD201MM202YYYY22017btnOKComputeactualvalue Japan experienced relatively tiny cumulative inflation 224 50 years

So Grandpa paid months rent 1967 buy Japanese lender 2 pizzas 50 years later And Japanese lender actually lost money process Huh Guess thats interest rates higher currencies higher inflation rates

Now obviously author right Japans inflation remains flat 0 next 50 years Japan certainly wont lose money deal Which excellent However still means India nonnegative inflation rate actually coming top long currency exchange doesnt go absolutely berserk 

Assuming 3 inflation rate pay back ₹ 143 Trillion 2067 paying back ₹ 0326 Trillion todays terms 

assuming peak conversion rate past 10 years JP¥  IN₹ 071872 worstcase scenario

This ₹ 14 trillion far less perceived value domestically 2067 2017 

Put another way take ₹ 326 Billion today invest reaaaalllyyy shittyass mutual fund yields 3 interest thats impossibly pathetic seriously 50 years easily pay loan ₹ 143 Trillion 

If youre using Fixed Deposit scheme gives 7 interest per annum need invest ₹ 49 Billion Try herehttpwwwthecalculatorsitecomfinancecalculatorscompoundinterestcalculatorphp

So take loan ₹ 109 trillion put ₹ 49 Billion aside 7 fixed deposit account use balance ₹ 104 trillion see fit hire strippers invest solar power plants build railway What call 104 trillion bucks see fit without needing pay back You call free money Obviously wisely invest better outcomes But yes effectively free 

Now mind arent getting cash getting solid investment generate revenue pay dues positive externalities employment new skills training techtransfer economic growth connected areas increased urbanization reduced environmental impact reduced accidents lower congestion etc It also leave lot money government coffers available investment projects next decades many see decent returns investment next 5 decades

Yes Japan comes winner deal India The higher domestic inflation cheaper repayment seem Just like Grandpas ₹ 1156 seems like paltry amount seen 50 years later Obviously dont want inflation high sub4 inflation rate keep economy healthy reducing burden future taxpayers paying big loan

This btw reason invest money ensure gives returns least 57 per annum order beat inflation Because otherwise sitting bank account money actually losing value time



But wait Theres more


The 508kmlong Mumbai Ahmedabad High Speed Rail MAHSR scheduled completion December 2023 commencement date sought advanced August 2022

Initially high speed train 10 cars capacity accommodate 750 people The Times India said It increase 16 cars accommodate 1200 people

According initial estimates around 16 crore people expected travel bullet train annually By 2050 around 16 lakh commuters travel highspeed train daily basis

 The fares could range Rs 3000  Rs 5000

Source  httpwwwhindustantimescomindianewsmostlyelevatedpartlyunderseaallyouneedtoknowaboutmumbaiahmedabadbullettrainstorynzG4ROjD9IRE00FcK4fD7Nhtml

They want complete 56 years lets conservative give 10 years Lets assume next 10 years construction lowvolume trains running directly jump 1200 capacity trains 2027 ease math That leaves us 40 years repay ₹ 143 trillion using train revenues

The article claims 16 crore people may travel annually initially thats 44000 people per day itll increase 160000 people per day 2050 Basically intend increase capacity 360 40 years Since capacity isnt something increase exponentially well assume linear growth capacity 44k 160k The train completes single trip 25 hours Assume 30 minute boardingdeboarding time either end single train conservatively make 1 full trip 35 hours That means single train comfortably make 4 trips day 14 hours active duty leaving 10 hours maintenance jazz Meaning one train capacity ferry 4800 people per day


    16000044000  116000 people increased capacity 40 years
    1160004800  24 trains added capacity 40 years
    401224  20 months time takes add one train system

Basically One new 1200seater train added every 20 months 40 years starterpack 9 trains initial load 44k people per day

So averaged 40 years around 129 trains operating That gives us 21 trains making 4 trips day Side note 214 Thats 84 trips per day ways meaning assuming 14 workinghours platform 3 trains departing every hour one direction  one every 20 minutes  convenient Each trip capacity 1200 people 365 days year 40 years 

    214120036540  1471680000 passengers total

1471680000 passengers total thats 147 Billion passengers And much charged per seat per trip ₹ 3000 

That gives us total revenue collection ₹ 4415 Trillion 

Lets assume train runs 70 seating capacity average They would still collect ₹ 309 Trillion 

Operational costs around ₹ 412 cr ₹ 412 billion per yearhttptimesofindiaindiatimescomcityahmedabadYearlybullettrainoperationstocostRs412crReportarticleshow39191311cms comes total ₹ 1648 billion 40 years 

That leaves us ₹ 293 Trillion revenue need repay total loan value ₹ 143 Trillion 

That leaves cool ₹ 1496 trillion pure profit paying back every penny loan

Wait 

Youre telling basically drop ticket prices ₹ 1500 per seat act almost surely yield packed trains every day still pay loan 

I dunno Lets check 

 1471 billion trips  ₹ 1500  ₹ 22075 Trillion 
 STILL assume 75 occupancy ₹ 1656 Trillion
 Deducting operational costs leaves ₹ 1491 Trillion 

Hot damn pay train using ticket collection even price tickets ₹ 1500 using conservative estimates possible With ₹ 1656 Trillion revenue easily could allow increase operational costs ₹ 5675 billion per year whopping 38 increase operational costs compared ₹ 412 billion figure still able pay everything fine 40 years

Who right minds thinks bad idea Hell AhmadabadMumbai Sleeper buses take 8 hours charge ₹ 7001400 The Shinkansen absolutely flooded drop prices

ASSEMBLY ELECTIONSJOY FOR INC WAKEUP CALL FOR BJP

Can Congress upset odds 2019

The biggest question everybody today’s results Congress fight back Modi BJP especially 2019 around corner While performance Telangana Mizoram disappointing take heart wins Rajasthan Chhattisgarh 

For party disarray year half ago clear sense direction party high command Congress slowly staggered back onto feet fight Modi Shah duo With seemingly reinvigorated Rahul Gandhi helm taken fight BJP Modi’s bastionGujarat cobbled together alliance Karnataka snatched Rajasthan Chhattisgarh back BJP 

While party trying hard capitalise anger masses Central government’s policies decisions Congress still lot work ground level seriously wants come back power 2019 While results might show Congress winning three states distinct real possibility voters fed state BJP governments due antiincumbency still going vote Modi become PM 2019The Congress’s performance Rajasthan also considered relatively disappointing chaotic seat distribution infighting rebel Congress leaders costing party another 15 odd seats

What next BJP

While results aren’t going make BJP workers happy BJP still remains pole position come back power 2019 With called ‘Third Front’ still nowhere near fruition Congress’s efforts pitch RaGa NaMo exactly gathering steam opposition parties means Modi continues popular political leader India currently The extradition Christian Michel related Agusta Westland scam recent court order allowing extradition Vijay Mallya UK also serve timely boost BJP’s anticorruption rhetoric slippery slope Nirav Modi Mehul Choksi sagas The BJP also made effort hide Hindutva agenda starting renaming Allahabad Prayagraj Faizabad Ayodhya BJP led state governments Rajasthan Uttar Pradesh also cleared way building gigantic statues Lord Shiva Rama respectively Hindutva pitch get brazen leadup 2019

While BJP might smug chances 2019 keep eye grumbling middle class farmersboth unhappy poll promises kept The agrarian distress lack job creation taken shine Modi’s ‘booming economy’ pitch BJP anxious ensure doesn’t snowball Furthermore central government’s rift RBI frequent clashins Supreme Court created image overzealous central government keen take control independent central agencies 

Will KCR lead formation Third Front

TRS’s emphatic victory state Telangana K Chandrashekar Rao’s victory speech might mean resurgence chances formation Third Front consisting regional satraps including Mamata Banerjee Mayawati The Third Front traditionally cluster regional parties choose neither align Congress BJP However Third Front always talked alternative India’s twoparty stronghold never managed give serious fight Congress BJP recent history The times Third Front Federal Front provided serious threat Congress BJP 1996 1998 staked power Centre twice HD Deve Gowda Quite predictably government collapsed soon due infighting horsetrading MPs

Policy/Economy,Demolishing Some LCA Tejas Falsehoods,531,4r5hgo,Bernard_Woolley,120,"The Tejas old design It taken 32 long years develop And despite development long isnt truly indigenous Its heart engine foreign origin So weapons avionics Furthermore deficient performance Indian Air Force IAF wants RafalesSu30MKIsF16s instead

Every time Tejas achieves important milestone criticisms repeated ad nauseum popular media Twitter internet forums bhelpuri stalls Jhumritalaiyya Its infuriating see effort magnitude one produced many successeshttpwwwibnlivecomblogsindiasauravjhatheradianceoftejasabrightprospectformakeinindia10879748651html panned time So Ive taken liberty put together handydandy LCA Tejas mythbusting guide counter them

And without wasting time Ill jump right in

False Argument 1 The Tejas late It development 32 years

The figure technically true deprives narrative muchneeded context The Tejas’ origins indeed traced back 1983 concept Light Combat Aircraft LCA conceived However IAF finalise air staff requirements ASRs 1985 initial funding come 1986 The project definition phase—the phase technical requirements defined conceptual design prepared end 1988 The final design completed 1990 Full funding issued 1993 development prototype commenced earnest See list milestoneshttpwwwtejasgovinhistorymilestoneshtml reference

Following several years delay development process—delays least partly traced back overly optimistic RD timeline projections scope creep US sanctions Indiahttparticleseconomictimesindiatimescom20130531news396557831drdochiefvksaraswatlcaproject following 1998 nuclear tests—the Tejas first flight 2001 From project proceeded pace different comparable fighter aircraft development programmes worldwide It slated achieve final operational clearance FOC stage aircraft considered fully ready squadron service early 2017 fifteen years date first flight At time expected ready carry multiple functions beyond visual range BVR airtoair combat shortrange dogfighting precision ground attack variety guided unguided weaponry

That compares well contemporary fourthgeneration fighters like Eurofighter Typhoon JAS39 Gripen The first technology demonstrator would later called Typhoon first flew 1986httpsenwikipediaorgwikiTimelineoftheEurofighterTyphoon The definitive version AESA radar still service todayhttpswwwflightglobalcomnewsarticleseuroradarnearsflighttestphaseforcaptoreonty416564 30 years line The Tranche2 version drop precision bombs fire BVR missiles wasnt available 2008httpwwwrafmodukequipmenttyphooncfm Another European fighter Swedish GripenC fullspectrum capabilities started entering service 2002 also fourteen years first flight 

The Tejas FOC capabilities late 2016 The fact ADA managed achieve similar better timelines Tejas first flight without benefit half century experience building advanced fighters industrial ecosystem enables hightechnology proceed swiftly achievement given enough credit

False Argument 2 Because inordinate delays development Tejas deficient

Just development delayed doesnt mean design one 1983 The IAF updated requirements quite often kept demanding additional capabilities throughout design development phase It Catch22 situation constant change requirements kept design uptodate also led several years delays need redesign retest recertify subsystems every modification Off top head I remember IAF demanded following modifications pretty late program

 Open avionics architecture
 Precision bombing capabilities
 Heavier A2A missiles R73 vs R60
 Internal EW suite included selfprotection jammer
 Inflight refueling
 More capable radar missiles LCA Mk1A

With modifications Tejas went simple pointdefence interceptor fullblown albeit shortlegged multirole fighter 

False Argument 3 The LCA falls short several performance parameters like empty weight range turn rates etc The IAF allowed 53 concessionspermanent waivers design

Like 32year delay scary looking quote paints false picture fighter aircraft programmes work

First important remember Tejas carry tasks intended quite competently It fight aircraft beyond visual range equipped AESA radar DerbyDerbyER missiles could end becoming capable BVR platform IAF service The addition Israeli helmetmounted sight coupled missiles whose seekers wide field view R73 Python IVV make fearsome dogfighter compensate minuscule shortfalls aerodynamic performance It drop laserguided bombs ground targets great precision It also easy fly In words IAFhttpwwwbusinessstandardcomarticlecurrentaffairsairforcedrdopleasedwithtejasperformanceatbahrain1160222003211html fighter’s control harmony comparable best world… The intuitive cockpit layout highly reliable life support systems provide comfort well excellent situational awareness There many triumphs many fact recount here

Secondly every fighter project concludes specifications arent met deficiencies performance It’s never big roadblock induction service And said done 53 small number far design concessions go pretty small portion entire range capabilities Even simpler aircraft like C17 httpcommunityseattletimesnwsourcecomarchivedate19910528slug1285732 enter service deficiencies These either compensated using improvements areas offset performance shortfalls accepted interest availability combat 

Again I shall go back Eurofighter Typhoon illustrate point Remember I mentioned first flew 1986 Twentytwo years later couldnt independently drop laserguided bombhttpwwwtheregistercouk20080701eurofighteraustereairtogroundwhatjoy target precision Basic BVR combat capability available Tranche 2 models procured 2008httpwwwrafmodukequipmenttyphooncfm 14 years first flight Even close air combat capabilities decidedly limited The helmet mounted sight HMS—a system allows pilot cue weapons onto enemy aircraft simply turning head offers quantum jump dogfighting capabilities—did enter service 2010httpswwweurofightercomaboutus

The F35 hobbled similar issues terrible program management several yearshttpwwwvanityfaircomnews201309jointstrikefighterlockheedmartin It didnt begin turn corner 2012 began rapidly demonstrating capabilities expected it

The companies running projects aero giants decades experience behind How one expect ADA never developed fighter entire existence deliver capable product experiencing fewer failures 

Thirdly IAF works deficient designs time The Gnat Su7 hobbled short ranges limited payloads procured large numbers The MiG21 initially inducted underwhelming Its range limited missiles didnt work The Bison still riddled issues The Jaguar deficient navattack suite It practically useless long range strike role IAF HAL developed implemented DARIN upgradeshttpstkstaleswordpresscom20100307thedarinstory The MiG27s navigation system never performed satisfactorilyhttpwwwlivefistdefencecom201007specialreportstoryofindiasmig27html reliability terrible But none troubled IAF Why LCA failing achieve handful design parameters something raise huge hue cry about


False Argument 4a The LCA isnt really indigenous Many subsystems foreign origin

But many critical subsystems Indian origin The first one comes mind carbonfibre composite airframe It highend product reduces weight thus permitting carriage substantial external payload aids maintenance brings manufacturing time The fact technology involved manufacture exported Airbus testament success

Another example digital flybywire FBW system developed scratch ADA scientists India work notes equipment impounded Lockheed Martin 1998 No country earth one developed complex system gotten work perfectly first try It works well first tested F16XL US nuclear tests improved testbeds handling qualities several flight regimes There reason Tejas test pilots call aircraft fly

There many examples The avionics The mission computers The navigation equipment displays humanmachine interface The EW systems This stuff isnt trivial yardstick

Now coming foreign components aboard aircraft With exception Americans extent Russians every country used foreign subsystems extensively aircraft designs The GripenhttpwwwairframercomaircraftdetailhtmlmodelJAS39Gripen American engine British airframe design Swiss carbonfibre Italian radar American flight control system cockpit critical components purchased Britain This spite Swedes industrial base far advanced Indias extensive experience developing coldwar fighters Draken Gripen The Rafale Typhoon use American ejection seats Their flight control system uses actuators Moog American company The Russians buying Damocles podshttpswwwflightglobalcomnewsarticlesrussianfighterstousethalesdamoclestargetingpods220747 Su35s French stopped military exports invaded Crimea Nearly every Chinese fighter service today uses Russian engine Russian ejection seat slew Russian weaponry If aircraft qualify indigenous surely Tejas too

The choice Indian design agencies faced quite stark tried build every little component inhouse thus reinventing wheel every step Or used technologiessubsystems available easily market initial stages made attempt indigenise lifecycle product Its obvious latter sensible path take

In final analysis Tejas aircraft designed Indians India tailored Indian requirements If doesnt make indigenous I dont know does
	

False Argument 4b Okay I get But aircrafts heart engine fully imported Surely utter failure front

Yes It protracted development cycle good reason A jet engine arguably represents pinnacle modern technology making challenging system world develop scratch It produce ungodly amounts power size operate edge physics allows The GE F404—which ended replacing Kaveri LCA—weighs shade 1000 kg develops close 80 kN wet thrust Assuming propels LCA Mach 09 sea level 1100 kmh developing 24400 kW 32700 hp Thats 32 hp per kg In contrast Formula1 car engine generates 8 9 hp per kg far one get piston engines

What take generate much power One needs critical components like turbine blade assemblies see inlet temperatures 1400°C subject extreme forces A backofthe envelope calculation using rectally extracted figures tells single high pressure turbine blade weighing 50 gm rotating 16000 RPM end 500 mm diameter disk subject centrifugal force 3500 kgf Imagine two Honda Civics hanging tiny blade large two fingers held together There transverse load component well 80 kN thrust distributed turbine blades 

In order sustain loads exotic materials precision manufacturing techniques required Steel melts 1400°C starts rapidly losing strength less 500°C obviously option Modern engines instead use nickelbased superalloys Moreover material cant simply cast forged machined shape The blade produced via directional solidification grown single crystal looks like lab production shop The shape intricate There internal channels route cold air taken compressor surface blade keep cool

The fan compressor combustor gearbox assemblies bearings  theyre complex And precision manufactured ensure microscopic imbalances dont end leading excessive vibrations could end destroying engine aircraft flight Then requirements like safety fuel efficiency minimum total technical life reliability add multiple layers complexity design

Now imagine magnitude effort required develop something like practically zero infrastructure little terms  preexisting knowledge base And skinflint bureaucrats refusing approve requests funding test equipment manufacturing tools without documentation submitted triplicate subject audit audit

Now let us talk costs The GTRE spent Rs 2000 crorehttpeconomictimesindiatimescomnewsdefencers2101crorespentondevelopmentofindigenouskaverienginehereswhytheresbeenadelayarticleshow48282481cms approximately 640 million equivalent US dollars exchange rate inflation variations happened 1989 taken account developing Kaveri This seems like lot see advanced nations spend billions programmes almost never develop cleansheet designs They always building existing knowledge existing designs 

Jeff Immelt CEO GE sayshttpwwwbusinessinsidercominterviewwithgeceojeffimmeltontransformingge201512 If could make something 60 people garage GE shouldnt But make jet engine theres like one half people world make jet engine And really good If want compete youve got put wayback machine go back 25 years invest 1 billion 25 years maybe maybe emphasis mine youre going able compete us

Think second It requires 25 years And billion dollars And youre likely fail succeed

The Chinese pouring money espionage resources jet engine development efforts budgeted 300 billion yuanhttpwwwreuterscomarticleukchinaengineidUSLNE89T00W20121030—about 45 billion todays US dollars—over next 20 years engine programs alone still facing significant hurdleshttpwwwreuterscomarticleukchinaengineidUSLNE89T00W20121030 Why people feel India would get significant results spending thousand crores

In case Kaveri isnt complete write A naval derivative Kaveri Marine Gas Turbinehttpwwwbusinessstandardcomarticleeconomypolicybuiltforairforcekaverienginechosenbynavy1090908000891html may end powering Indian Navy vessels It also consideration power Indian UAVhttpwwwbusinessstandardcomarticlenewsiansnowkaverienginetopowerindigenousuav1150730016501html 

There civilian spinoffs For example Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited BHEL useshttpwwwdrdogovindrdoEnglishDRDOBROCHURE2015pdf investment casting technology developed GTRE manufacturing blades gas turbines used power generation

False Argument 5 In globalised world point reinventing wheel The IAF simply dump buy GripenF16MiG35

What true cell phones cars isn’t true military equipment In long run peace war IAF would best served fielding fighters designed built India Thats way equip large fleet relatively small budget There advantages developing technology inhouse less dependence foreign suppliers leading increased strategic independence Creation stronger local economy industrial ecosystem The freedom tinker design optimise suit local requirements without running afoul IP agreements OEM Spinoffs civilian world And forth And going indigenous indeed way forward IAF live fielding underperformingproblematic designs beginning It make peace fact aerospace RD slow painful process fraught risk

Thats practically everyone else The Chinese seek latest greatest toy initial designs Q5 JH7 J8 J10 failed match US Japan India fielded If J10B J20 flying today PLAAF PLAN flew inferior aircraft decades industrial capabilities matured As Tejas programs achievements quite impressive country developed fourthgeneration fighter good GripenC scratch It uses homegrown technology Gripen including critical subsystems like digital FBW composite airframe large portion avionics etc Many applied IAFs legacy aircraft upgrade packages To throw away handful challenges Lockheed Boeing offering transfer manufacturing lines India would incredibly utterly stupid If Tejas cancelled repeat thirtyyear saga next time India tries build fighter

Policy/Economy,Understanding Petro Dollar possible decline Fiat Currencies affects India Why maybe time look elsewhere hold foreign reserves,56,6z7u08,concernadian,45,"The whole thing came recently discussions I people use dollar international trade would happen major economies world stopped using Dollar What Impact BRICS Why US many wars middle east supposedly oil never really take oil How US rich 800 military bases around world defence budget larger rest world combined About countries still hold US dollar reserves US trillions dollars debt much debt US economy still afloat So I thought putting together anyone else may want learn Now I gleaned reading matter I economist anyone wants correct anything I would welcome accept criticism reference material substantiating point

 1944 countries entered Bretton Woods Agreement basically said world’s currrecies would backed US Dollar US dollar would backed gold country could convert currency US dollars redeem US gold exchange rate 35 dollars per ounce gold Since US largest gold reserves time 75 entire worlds gold everyone agreed This also allowed US treasury fix exchange rates dollar different currencies set interest rates interbanking transactions etc However multiple wars US ’60s caused domestic inflation US value Dollar fall This caused panic countries started redeeming gold US treasury The US gold fell 20000 tonnes 8100 tonnes quickly Thus 1971 Nixon closed gold window ie suspended ability nation redeem US gold dollars took gold backing US Dollar While allowed US retain gold reserves made need US dollar among countries non existent So everyone started move away Dollar After US economy started spiral price gold became 135 dollars per ounce On top Arab world hiked oil prices Now US desperately needed stabilize spiral So brokered deal Saudis oil producers would trade oil nothing US Dollars convince OPEC middle eastern north African oil producing countries also invest OPEC’s oil profits US treasury buying US Treasury bonds This basically means OPEC buying US debt Not US printing Dollars amount Foreign investments US treasury made Oil producing nations oil profits So basically profits every barrel sold OPEC make way US treasury become value dollars printed Ultimately profits oil stronger dollar lesser profits oil weaker dollar Thus US gets double benefit every barrel oil way In exchange US would sell Saudis advance weapons gold demanded So basically weapons gold sale exchange trading oil dollars props US dollar Gold still propping US dollar indirectly forcing oil producers trade dollars Thus petrodollar born This caused world need US dollar If wanted buy oil needed US dollar either converting currency selling stuff US The latter preferred cheaper exchanging currency also grows economy So US became benchmark international trade since country hope grow economy without using energy aka oil can’t oil without US dollars As long countries need oil US print Dollars thin air balance oil barrels explained without actually even owning single drop oil Other countries need gold balance currency US need control oil need control currency traded keep economy afloat later US foreign policy Similarly US bokered deal Latin American countries trade US Dollar also give precedence US EU Japanese products trade So countries decide shun dollar trade currencies would eventually cause OPEC switch well Dollar could collapse

How Well US basically printing enormous amounts money thin air This money used domestically much larger extent globally If international oil trade dollar stops people stop needing dollar use currency So internationally circulating dollars would come back US Now many dollars little amount treasury would cause hyperinflation economic spiral However logical next step would destroy excess dollars coming abroad would keep country’s economy afloat While okay remember dollar printed The foreign investments treasury profits oil trade dollars That would go away well essentially leaving nothing treasury dollar valued Hence dollar literally worth money printed on

Second since US currency basically petrodollar power depends control oil So right whoever controls middle east major power Today Saudi Arabia controls Middle East US controls Saudi Arabia USSaudi brotherhood sort makes impossible countries influence Russia tried decades establish strong foothold middle east unsuccessful It also dictated US foreign policy far last 5 decades Like I said US needs control oil reserves currency oil traded Hence wars hear oil actually oil per se intimidation tactics countries announced would longer accept dollar currency international oil trade Egs When Ayatollah Iran announced intention denounce dollars oil trade use currency instead US backed Iraq go war Iran even provided Weapons mass destruction use Iran later used excuse invade Iraq prosecuted Saddam Hussein When Iraq invaded Kuwait  major producer oil able pay loans Kuwait later asked Euro used oil trade rather Petrodollar US invaded Iraq When Gaddafi asked gold based Dinar instead US dollars oil trade US invaded Libya When Chavez Us staged coup Venezuela However starting nonpetro currency would break link oil Middle east would become less relevant Economic power interest energy concerns It still important less economic geopolitical chessboard US today It may actually solution achieving peace middle east

However another thing happens Middle East controls prices oil tied Dollar Recently Middle East OPEC basically Saudi Arabia decided drop international prices economic reasons Now countries oil production major source revenue trade dollars eg many N African countries Venezuela seen economy completely stabilise destroyed These countries sick US Saudi controlling markets way affects countries adversely Hence countries switching international trading system gold based currency cause economies stabilise

The international reserves EU etc hand seen increased holdings OPEC countries worried increasing power countries international banking system They would glad get rid holdings

Now non Dollar currency would cause fall US dollar value In lieu another thing needs considered A lot developing countries international trade deficits Now trade deficits currency country debt owed internationally accepted currency eg Dollar If debt dollars conversions interest rates borrowing determined according rules US treasury Again rates US treasury linked value dollar Most countries giving loans prefer dollars historically Dollar strong trusted collapse hence money owe safe The countries taking loans also convert debts dollars easier country debt owed cannot change value debt owed manipulating currency dollar determined conversion currencies fixed rates safe everyone However slight problem If owe debt 1 dollar someone pay debt depend value dollar currency particular instant So dollar gotten stronger wrt currency shall pay money dollar gotten weaker owe less money currency Hence fall dollar would beneficial countries owe debt dollars bad countries loaned debt dollars

Also taking debt dollars becomes cheaper value dollar falls since US treasury interest rates directly tied dollars hence becomes cheaper borrow dollars Also I said grows weaker still yo owe less money

One thing consider regarding fall Dollar Uptil oil producers buying US treasury bonds due Bretton Woods deal Other countries US corporations Now US treasury gives fixed rate interest investing treasury This rate turn linked value dollar Stronger dollar interest US Treasury bonds foreign countries invest Now means foreign countries would much rather invest money US Treasury assured fixed rate interest invest 3rd world countries take risk maybe losing However value dollar fall countries would much rather draw US treasury invest startups different countries domestically etc

The side coin would countries dependent US investment Should value dollar fall investment received US would lesser value

On hand one thinh Like I said investments dollars governed US treasury rules Now basically US banks cut taxes money transfer conversion artificially keeping low fuel domestic world trade etc  If dollar collapse people wouldn’t trade dollars They would trade currencies The inetrbanking across world would governed rules currency trade eg BRICS nations follow tariffs etc Shanghai Bank reserves held So effect would depend rules bank deal detrimental beneficial depending bank’s policies compared dollar

Also countries holdings US treasury would lose entire value foreign reserves On hand coountries like BRICS reserves international banks would retain value foreign reserves banks

What mean

Indian Currency would also fall fall dollar current state Now usually run around perception Indian currency backed gold That’s true The truth 99 today’s currencies US Dollar Euro Indian rupee fiat currencies ie value determined gold hold economic strength government Only average 4–7 country’s currency today backed gold US Dollar  45 Indian rupee  5 The rest held terms foreign reserves countries like form US Dollar around 70 US treasury bonds world bank IMF currencies around 25 BRICS foreign reserves etc Currently rs 1000  rs 50 gold around 670 held form US dollars Rs 280 currencies You might ask Well remember Bretton Woods agreement At time US 75 world’s gold backed dollar dollar backed currencies currency country backed directly indirectly dollar gold Now difficult keep gold country convenient countries hold foreign reserves dollars especially fixed exchange rates provided Hence portion currency held dollars However Nixon shock 1971 dollar removed gold backing So automatically currencies backed dollar 99 world currencies also became fiat currencies result However dollar still good trusted one thought much especially since dollars printed thin air However prospect trust dollar fading started worry experts Because senseless printing dollars exchange fiat currencies total amount currency nowhere near compensated gold reserves even gold world put together It would form 10 currency world Now putting disturbing detail aside Dollar collapse 670 rupees 1000 would become worthless So isn’t wise hold US dollars No many countries woken fact

China secretly amassing large amounts gold OPEC countries started removing capital US treasury See oil producers receiving US gold exchange trading oil US dollars accumulated holdings countries’ treasuries Now crazy gold received bought material assets like real estate etc even countries Now simply sell US treasury bonds buy assets gold real estate recent years Now start depleting treasury cause fall value dollar turn causing countries withdraw invest elsewhere That coupled Russia China trade Roubles Yuan India Iraq trading oil outside dollar Germany China trading outside Dollar strenghtening BRICS bank etc Dollar showing steady decline So India also wisen start replenishing treasury gold sell holdings dollars euros invest currencies rise This one reason BRICS could important India countries BRICS whether like 

Another thing using another currency would would take away power US slap economic sanctions whichever country choose This one major reasons Putin teamed China  order bypass US sanctions

Edit The thing worries nations  international trade foreign reserves dollars gives US single handed say economies Just like Nixons unilateral decision changed fate currencies decisions also change economies US dictate rules dont follow  sanctions So countries want take back power making decisions hands

Next petrodollar based commodity depleted Oil reserves declining world moving towards sources  gree energy nuclear energy etc So petrodollar decline destined However would US next They could shift backing currency nuclear reserves new crazy idea someones hat That inevitably affect countries want say it

On hand Chinas attempt start gold backed currency may pan like I said gold world sufficient back currencies world Also since currencies still large amount dollar backing fall dollar would make percent currency valueless therefore even reserve another foreign currency could still cause fall Indian currency though might little mitigated On hand fiat currencies run investors trust currency So even dollar falls fiat currency foreign reserves dollar may fall confidence currency still high Sadly currency would Chinese Yuan So policy fix I still trying work solution This post evolution My thoughts still evolution I would really like economists come hold serious well informed sane discussion this

 I add points occur brought forward online offline discussions

Policy/Economy,Sardar Legacy Spiritual Translation Two Marathi Articles,3,9tsmlb,ArchangelleSnek,3,"The credit integrating almost princely states barring three 15 August 1947 undoubtedly goes Sardar Patel But tired body mind postindependence postGandhi assassination

Its one thing like historic fables another consider history There often efforts sell fables history But time look true history Currently certain fables sold history Some Sardar Patel Hindutvavadi subsequently antiMuslim leading country instead Nehru problems ie Pakistan JammuKashmir wouldve solved already Due wishes masses misunderstandings considered history Theres effort sell fables history

First lets tackle lethel delusion That Mahatma Gandhi put weight behind Pandit Nehru Sardar Patel wouldve first Prime Minister A liked fable halls Whatsapp university Reality however begs differ Pandit Nehru wasnt chosen Prime Minister last minute It going consideration since 1929 At time Purna Swaraj Declaration Independence India consideration officially announced 26 January 1930 Its leadership came easily Nehru 2nd popular leader Indian National Congress Gandhi Then challenge elections per Government India Act 1935 For option handover party presidentship Nehru The popularity necessary win elections Gandhi Nehru Sardar Patel main fundraiser chairman Congress Central Parliamentary Board time However meant Nehru bigger responsibility since President face party That reason 1942 Gandhi declared successor The whole party stood strong resolve 1946  year independence  Maulana Abul Kalam Azad resigned presidentship Nehru


Its interesting check delusions people claim Sardar shouldve Prime Minister After release prison 1945 good health He struggling diabetes bloodpressure mind gloomy family issues He severe heart attack 4 March 1948 barely month Gandhi assassination Even doctors given hopes Sardar survived took toll health He said next news wont sickness death He died December 1950 He didnt live see first general election India Nehru 15 years younger Sardar belonged generation Gandhi Jinnah three died shortly independence Sardar Patels words enough remove doubt desire Prime Ministership Desire demands youth health We none He even conceded crowd Bombay rally come Jawahar me

This tell us unrealistic claim Sardar PM


Now let us talk partition Sardar Patel one first people agree partition proposal Mountbatten Nehru accepted later Maulana Abul Kalam Azad hand staunchly opposed partition till end He opinion India shouldnt divided He written India Wins Freedom It might politically incorrect speak highly Azad current political climate But documented history Patel first one accept truth isnt right make Hindus suffer dream Undivided India Nehru Gandhi followed accept bitter reality So three equally responsible partition It  politically convenient blame partition Gandhi Nehru But isnt reality 

Finally lets talk love Hindutva He none documented many historians journalists Narhar Kurundkar Govindrao Talvalkar Ramchandra Guha Rafiq Zakaria even American Vincent Sheean He major role giving religious roles Indian Muslims Minority Institues also special rights thanks Patel He never opposed leadership Khan Abdul Gafar Khan Northwest region oppose Shaikh Abdulla Kashmir Not never felt limit rights Indian Muslims creation Pakistan It also history admonished Uttar Pradeshs Chief Minister  Govind Vallabh Pant idols Rama placed Babri Masjid 1949 He opinion resolving matter talks Theres also example Patel giving different treatment Hindu Muslim rulers Princely states Hindu Maharaja Travancore intended stay independent So theres reason claim Patels politics motivated religion  Infact outlook towards RSS changed Gandhi Assassination Even though ties RSS Gandhi Assassinations never proved opinion ban along Hindu Mahasabha 



A reader called accuse favourite JRD said Sardar Patel become Prime Minister India would followed different path could better economy today I spoke end call change heart Why Lets see

History tells us Gandhis economic policies opposed Nehru Patel two also difference opinion Nehrus economic policies layer naive socialism Which gave birth stateowned enterprises It spread much goverment making wristwatches Nationalization core economic policies Its hated idea profit 

JRD Nehru disagreement point JRD opinion governments job run airline company It noted JRDs favourite child Air India nationalized Nehru Patel agreed JRD opinion businesses left businessmen JRDs opinion context Sardar Patel younger mand become Prime Minister India would followed different path could better economy today

Now caller didnt take account Patels health Nor JRD speak Nehrus popularity politics His focus comparison economy

Now lets come present Nehrus economic policies criticised many political parties including one currently power The criticism includes inefficieny irresponsibilty unnecessary hirings expenses etc 

Narasimha Rao took stand love stateowned enterprises Him Manmohan Singh opned doors economic liberalization Rao throughly Congressman But didnt hesitate throw policies predecessor Atal Biharis government came close Raos He pushed privatization sold state enterprises operating loss As member BJP right Nehru 

Now Vaypayees party came power 2014 This part businessfriendly progressive So given PSUs get evem freedom Sins Congress resulted loss banks air india state enterprises The BJPs admiration Patel meant even economic improvements would done As sign admiration goverment decided build monument Patel So far Congressis ignored Patel people decied build statue tall could ignore Thats pay tribute heros

Around 3000 crores Rupees spent glorious monument Who paid The caller didnt know 

So list generous people contributed monument Rupees

 Indian Oil  900 Crores

 Oil Natural Gas Commission  500 Crores

 Bharat Petroleum  450 Crores

 Hindustan Petroleum  250 Crores

 Power Grid  125 Crores

 Gujrat Mineral Development Corporation  100 Crores

 Engineers India  50 Crores

 Petronet India  50 Crores

 Balmer Lawrie  6 Crores

Does list ring bell All Government owned companies Who born Nehruvian economics policies  opposed Sardar Patel And monument funded companies

Policy/Economy,India bullying Bhutan,46,6q4rou,rorschach34,36,"I came across post FB feed Bhutanese woman criticising India International Relations forum It great read different perspective altogether It would great guys share views post 

WARNING  Long wall text



WHO IS BULLYING BHUTAN

On 26th June 2017 The Times India posted video YouTube claiming show Chinese Indian troops jostling shoving The Times commentator said “Indian land” “Indian side” Sikkim border He accused China “aggression” Chinese troops “extremely aggressive”

A days later emerged dispute nothing Indian land The ChinaIndia confrontation taking place ChinaBhutan border Yet Chinese Indian media quickly roused patriotic fervour railed other

Chinese media said India would “kicked out” “taught bitter lesson” “suffer greater losses 1962 One Chinese editorial mocked India’s claim defending Bhutan accused India treating Bhutan “vassal state” forcing support India

Meanwhile Indian headline read “China The World’s Bully” another article called China “a geopolitical bully…The mere fact vastly bigger country like China indulging antics peaceful neighbour like Bhutan shows extent Beijing stoop occupy territory illegally slicing like salami like done India”

Through welter mutual recriminations accusations Bhutan’s media remained remarkably quiet reserved “no aggressive posturing” reported Hindustan Times And The vast majority Bhutanese interest remote barren high altitude Doklam Plateau even heard it

But 89 sqkm parcel strategic importance India sees Chinese presence “dagger” pointed narrow vulnerable 21km wide “chicken’s neck” links northeastern states And Bhutan’s initial quiet restraint good enough India Bhutan quickly fell line
On 3rd July FirstPost headlines read “Bhutan vents first major disclaimer Chinese sides India…” The article went say “Bhutan first time taken major stand Chinas incursions … Bhutans stand Beijing… goes show countrys unwavering alliance support big brother India”
And characterization raises big question Who precisely bullying Bhutan And exactly Indian troops Bhutanese land first place Just defending poor little Bhutan big China’s bullying “aggression” Who fact seriously threatening Bhutan’s sovereignty independence – China India

When “friendship” turns control

In fact India maintained strong military presence throughout Bhutan half century exercising power influence every corner Bhutanese life Even remote strategic areas northern Bhutan far anything Indian Indian soldiers exercise authority control movement local Bhutanese Convoys Indian military trucks travel freely across Bhutan cannot checked contents Bhutanese authorities The Indian army occupied Haa Dzong decades given indication handing back Bhutanese The Dzongs since time Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel founder Bhutan seat power symbol governance
It noteworthy Indian troops’ efforts block Chinese road construction Bhutan border portrayed Indian media stopping China building roads India – revealing little respect Indians really Bhutanese “sovereignty” But spin surprising In Bhutan IMTRAT Indian Military Training General Indian Ambassador residing two prized real estates capital said powerful men country even determining get published national media

When Bhutan obtained Asian Development Bank funding strategic highway linking east west avoid necessity Bhutanese travel troubled strikeprone often violent Assam West Bengal India vetoed plan The highway cancelled Bhutan remains dependent India’s grace mercy internal eastwest transit Just weeks ago angry mob Indians beat Bhutanese truck driver set truck fire involved road accident
But Indian interference infringement Bhutanese sovereignty extends far beyond militarystrategic sphere every aspect Bhutan’s political economic life

Thus Bhutan sovereign independent nation world diplomatic relations five permanent UN Security Council members – US UK France China Russia – India jealous exclusive hegemony Bhutan fearful competitive influence won’t allow it
Japan long friend Bhutan helping fund many developmental projects Bhutan The Japanese wished embassy Bhutan foster closer ties development projects However firm plans agreement build Japanese Embassy Thimphu abruptly cancelled due India’s disapproval

When China invited Bhutan exhibit Shanghai EXPO 2010 offering free pavilion would central installation EXPO India forbade Bhutanese participation Independent sovereign nations world took part EXPO sans Bhutan India even forbade Bhutan went participated EXPO even building pavilion India regularly nixes Bhutanese official commercial missions visits China though conducts impunity apparently due Indian disapproval potential competition overweening influence

More ominously India blatantly interfered Bhutan’s elections political processes India strongly objected Bhutan’s former Prime Minister forging extensive new diplomatic ties carving independent foreign policy furious Prime Minister simply met talked China’s Premier Rio  20 conference And India decided get rid him
Just days 2013 elections India removed subsidies liquefied petroleum gas kerosene thereby doubling tripling prices essential commodities signal disapproval existing government The cynical tactic worked new government far compliant obedient India’s interests elected

Hydropower – cooperation colonization
But cornerstone IndiaBhutan “cooperation” three decades hydropower cheap power boon India’s growing economy accounts fully 40 Bhutan’s revenues 25 GDP Indian financing switched 70 grant 30 loan 30 grant 70 loan higher interest rates also direct cause Bhutan’s escalating debt even deepened Bhutanese dependence India

Since July 2006 Bhutan India agreed develop 10000 MW hydropower ten large projects benign sheen apparent cooperation quickly faded commissioned projects delayed costs mushroomed Costs jumped US 240 million Mangdechhu doubled Punatsangchhu–II tripled Punatsangchhu–I US 500 million 15 billion end sight
And costs obviously don’t include massive environmental damages future generations Bhutanese pay A recent report India documented severe impacts water bodies resources forest wildlife loss heavy pollution The report reinforced Bhutan’s government statistics notes hydropower failed develop local capacity employment contracts going Indian companies
According IMF Bhutan’s government debt stands whopping 118 GDP 67 six years ago India far largest creditor accounting 64 Bhutan’s total debt By comparison India’s ratio government debt GDP 70 China’s 46 Why ratio matter Because it’s used investors measure country’s ability make future payments debt thus affecting country borrowing costs Higher borrowing costs worsen debt further

A recent British report global debt lists Bhutan one “among 14 countries fast heading towards debt crisis” The report details hydropower’s rapid loss economic viability concludes “Should hydropower sector’s financial performance continue deteriorate Bhutan’s solvency could threatened”
How convenient India And conditions attach bailouts pleas loan forgiveness
In day age sovereignty independence much likely undermined economic political control albeit far subtle hidden ways So definition “bullying” days must go far beyond oldfashioned geopolitical border disputes however minor insignificant still make good press TV images jostling Chinese Indian soldiers

Time ask hard questions – can’t publicly asked Bhutan

It’s time long overdue question benign India’s intentions Bhutan How much “cooperation” actually “exploitation” “domination And much India’s foreign aid Bhutan nearly US1 billion year actually signifies mounting control interference one side growing dependence erosion sovereignty other

But course Indian control Bhutanese expression politics questions never asked Bhutan’s supposed free “democracy” Just imagine Bhutan’s daily Kuensel newspaper staterun Bhutan Broadcasting Service radio television dared publish article Unimaginable How ironic India world’s largest democracy prides free speech utterly suppresses “friendly neighbour”
And here’s another question equally impossible ask How might benefit Bhutan warm bit China even establish diplomatic relations huge northern neighbour cooperate economically welcome selective Chinese aid investments Bhutan’s infrastructure
After connection China already goes far beyond political economic deep cultural spiritual affinity For example Bhutan shares directly China profound wisdom texts traditions Mahayana Buddhism China today experiencing unprecedented Buddhist revival creates natural intuitive bond Bhutan

In fact Bhutan already benefitting directly resurgence Buddhism China From one end Bhutan giant Shakyamuni Buddha statue Kuensel Phodrang Thimphu giant Guru Rinpoche statue Takila Lhuentse monasteries temples ceremonies rituals maintained sponsored supported Chinese donations contributions

For fawning gratitude praise adulation Bhutanese officials regularly heap India “special relations” Bhutan word acknowledgement appreciation officials ever utter steady quiet Chinese support precious Bhutanese culture traditions Support incidentally comes “no strings attached” crippling debt burden

And shared culture tradition major reason surge Chinese tourists flocking Bhutan greatly outnumbering tourists country And Chinese pay top dollar expensive tourist visas visit Bhutan thus making China far largest contributor Bhutan’s tourism industry Indian visitors come free requiring visa kind Sorry say ask hotel owner country least favourite least respectful troublesome guests unfailingly say “Indians”

The Prime Minister Bhutan agreed India promised sign South Asian Motor Vehicles Agreement MVA This would open Bhutan cars India Nepal Bangladesh strengthening India’s hold Bhutan Just imagine Bhutan’s roads filled Indian cars taxis buses trucks Indian tourists would come busloads totally running Bhutan’s carefully planned ‘quality quantity’ tourism policy helped protect Bhutan Indian presence would increase Bhutan’s roads would destroyed increased traffic resulting DANTAK presence come ‘repair maintain’ roads pristine environment would destroyed It interesting note Prime Minister Bhutan agreed sign agreement even National Assembly Bhutan voted Showing willing whatever Indians want
And despite absence diplomatic relations Bhutan’s commercial relations China already quietly flourishing beneath surface – way yakherders Bhutan’s northern borders Thimphu merchants dependent Chinese imports whose quality often far exceeds comparable Indian products

In short might Bhutan benefit ways one slipping away total domination one neighbours instead strategically playing leveraging ChinaIndia competition advantage
But questions let alone policies solutions like unwritten “no go zone” Bhutanese politics media Indeed telling mark sinister extent penetration Indian control subjugation Bhutan politician journalist dare touch questions tenfoot pole

Interestingly India unwittingly aided suppression free speech human rights utter failure western human rights groups even notice Rather west seems intent drawing attention human rights violations countries like China grown rapidly economic powerhouse global reach threatens western interests Conveniently India poses threat escapes western scrutiny

Yes China may occasionally though rarely “flex muscles” minor border disputes India accuses But compared Bhutan’s actual groundlevel experience interaction China isn’t India’s domination subjugation Bhutan far intrusive pervasive insidious extending every portion Bhutan’s social political economic fabric

From Outside Looking In

Don’t take word I ordinary Indian citizen exercising freedom speech Wouldn’t help could see Indian bureaucracy outside view It said unbiased opinion comes uninvolved So let’s Let’s see others think Indian bureaucracy

In October 2010 conclusion Commonwealth Games India Eric Ellis wrote post titled ‘A uncivil service‘ The Age talks Indian bureaucracy Unfortunately nothing good say He writes following –

The Delhi games showed world done daunting civil service takes control – result wasn’t pretty Corruption waste inefficiency obfuscation cancerous lack accountability officialdom – Olympian scale

Delhi’s dramas may revealing observers briefly touch India sadly common issues daily confronting long bedeviling billion Indians foreign investors urged invest money business Some economists calculated India’s bureaucratic inefficiency costs country 1 2 points annual growth

India’s daunting civil service supposed pride nation – ask privileged nabobs – instead malfunction misgovernance hold India back Enter average government office India one struck mountains yellowing paperwork years filing unfinished work ground sheer scale chaotic India’s myriad issues overwhelm


Another account Lant Pritchett Harvard University sheds brighter light Indian bureaucratic problem In paper 2009 titled “Is India Failing State“ described Indian bureaucracy one serious problems world today AIDS climate change He makes point foreign investments welfare schemes India matter never improve India’s economy long inefficient Indian bureaucracy These bureaucrats like tumorous growth eat away welfare funds like parasite

Now comes GST The grand scheme supposed propel Indian economy nobody knows heights  

Most restaurants online places Bangalore shamelessly add GST final bill justification mandatory Now I know mandatory food prices Practically none adjusted prices take tax component used added Case point freshmenu Great food great service everything Had noticing since time cant keep anymore

Not food malls etc show price without GST youre rude shock cashier tells final amount Didnt used amount earlier either way youd thought

I used admire current government lot Liked statesman Modi used appear Still respect foreign policy seems going right direction But end daymonth I take look wallet And frankly Ive let Cant enthusiastic government thats continually taking steps rip money I pay taxes regularly happily knowing itll used nation extent I keep paying 

The previous government used news various scams level corruption used mindboggling But sorry say never directly affected acquaintances Im way justifying least let middle class grow independently This government seems hell bent killing And done legally one really say anything 

Ill go limb say middle class consumption driving economic growth country since last 15 years measures govt taking theyre sure kill making middle class conservative spending And honestly Im actually wishing goes next election Well aware theres option actually vote hoping one comes up

The reality different narrative In reality PVN massive issues overcome

 A minority govt
 A partisan opposition even today Atleast today plank supposedly development back garibi hatao support PSUs death 
 Look seat strength opposition  JDCPI held 102 seats BJP 120 These two combined alone could defeat motion

If think UPA tough NDA tough todaythink PVn minority govt hardsell reforms dirty word back fight deeply vested interests If crony capitalist state today 1990 pretty much open house Rules policies made Dhirubhais

How Read on

To fair Rao great economist heck barely economist played political game well He instance put forth idea liberalising vocal sector say mines promptly backtrack As though surrendering putting place moremilder reform

Look howspectacularly played New Industrial Policy 91 It breathtaking move India virtually away Nehruvian era relics licensing control industries It could boomeranged sly fox Announce exact day At around 4 PM ensure made next days print news budget 91

What look like Mr MMS passed reform If boomerang Who could sacrificed FUCK I mean look admire sheer political statecraft wily old fox

Look broadly well handled whole reform process He first announced broad slew measures shut IMF promptly delayed introduction bills overall went slow actually bringing action And rolling thunder movement hit one broad policy front mild reforms Wait fall quell outright bribery needed introduce marginally morepowerful reform On went

One thing never pick battle knew would lose So never went big PSUs never big vested interests never farm social welfare schemes He brilliantly picked battles knew would win He admired Willy Brandt modelled wily old fox

The final piece puzzle Despite politician never openly spoke reforms overall aims This kept everybody guessing confused basically free wished  I think brilliance explained simply saying something used say often delaying taking decision decision This evident way handled quite spectacularly Fertilizer crisis He reduce fertilizer subsidies still political hot potato So fox Again push via MMS shit storm hit MMS offered resignation fox graciously refused AND sets committe mollifies protestors passes reforms 10 cut original increase

I mean level political guile statecraft astonishing

It fucking pity didnt govt absolute majority LS didnt get second term sadly Gandhi loyalist fault If had

Not even touching deft political moves I mean guy played spectrums like violin Left Check V P Singhs faves Montek Singh  Rakesh Mohan key advisors BJP Check There always dark speculation though allowed Babri Masjid taken trade BJP support reforms remain unfounded speculation He really supreme political master without single reform would passed

I must point sort angel something No He maybe personally corrupt dont know associated nay intimately associated deep rat bastard like Chandraswami PVN flaws shouldnt take away monumental achievements

Why 91 budget solandmark Here top reasons why

 Rupee devalued devalued again
 New trade policy favouring exporters bad word maaibaap socialistic model Indira Rajivnot Nehru
 Dismantled license raj
 Put forth austerity budget cool aimed straight away cut deficit 34 points
 He near abolished export subsidies

 “Is going Subramanian Swamy That wily little fox planning along”

 “Is going Pahlaj Nihlani He makes many interesting cuts probably he’ll good cutting interests too”

 “Is going Arundhati Bhattacharya The first woman RBI chairman That would sell boyz would sell well indeed”

 “Is going Tanmay Bhat He announce interest rate cuts Snapchat He’ll snap economy Bhat bring back shape”

But dear media ‘experts’ don’t seem talking real replacement change epic proportions going happen central bank So I present Monetary Policy Committee

Don’t take word important RR makes sly mention  NPA problem farewell letterhttpsrbiorginScriptsBSPressReleaseDisplayaspxprid37259 All one breath squeezed cryptic messages  ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° forced resign  ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° Governor RBI

 Inflation target zone monetary policy committee set policy yet formed Moreover bank clean initiated Asset Quality Review already brought credibility bank balance sheets still ongoing International developments also pose risks short term


OK RR sexy But n00b question What RBI Governor exactly


Before start talking big change talk little job Reserve Bank India Governor It would make easier explain transition Governor MPC

Check uribiys comment httpsnpredditcomrindiacomments4osapvnowthatraghuramrajanisleavingletstalkd4f7ll5 He explains part lucidly

Think RBI big bank lends smaller banks banks turn lend Commercial Banks also get money deposits etc lend people Thank uMyselfWalrus The Governor takes call interest rate RBI charge banks lending In turn banks would add tiny percentage interest give loans people like  The difference interest rates deposits  lending banks make profits central bank keeps control cheap expensive loans market The governor also sets Statutory Liquidity Ratio SLR banks That’s basically amount securities Gold bonds assets banks need disburse loans proportional amount

Apart setting interest rates also sort Bank Manager He keeps machine running smoothly speak He also decides much money printed denominations The Governor also gets put supercool signature currency notes He makes sure cheques get cleared fair exchange funds happens banks basically keeps watch banking sector regular audits 

The Governor incharge maintaining order foreign exchange market making sure country working towards goals set Foreign Exchange Management Act FEMA He also power issue directions banks recent one ordered cleanup balance sheets declare NonPerforming Assets NPAs This Asset Quality Review mentioned farethewell letter well Details NPA problem read herehttpwwwpolicypeepulcomblog2016511weneedtotalkaboutourbanks

Basically RBI governor gets control much money floating around market By increasingdecreasing interest rates control spending within market feel like finance god The one single job RBI Governor past years resist pressure successive governments  reduce interest rates much 

Or least part job gets news


OK So RBI Governor epic Finance God gets screw government right RIGHT

Hey That’s harsh

The Governor actually job ensuring economic stability Heshe ‘she’ that’s possible supposed think longterm ensure citizens don’t go insane spending spree create artificial financial bubbles burst later bite ‘em Eg The 2008 Housing Mortgage crisis US

The Government hand creature life 5 years In five years desperately trying woo voters get vote political party next election What would make people happier money spend ergo cheaper accessible loans 

The government day keep asking RBI Governor lower interest rates money flooded market Bubbles What bubbles Well deal burst The RBI Governor refuses time propping economy shoulders creature called ‘debt’ is… well… TERRIBLE idea

Well whatdoyaknow that’s change


Alrighty Tell big ‘change’

The Finance Bill 2016httpindiabudgetnicinub201617fbbillpdf passed last budget session Parliament controversial amendment FCRA act Clause 233httpwwwpolicypeepulcomblog2016511lastweekinparliament allowed foreign funding political parties But another amendment Reserve Bank India Act Clauses 216 220 created entity called “Monetary Policy Committee”

Earlier Governor whole  sole authority decide interest rates He could veto anything thought doesn’t benefit Indian economy It dictatorship way around Now MPC one setting rates making fiscal policies country

The MPC six members three RBI three ‘eminent personalities’ appointed central government The RBI peeps consist Governor Chairman Deputy Governor  one officer nominated RBI central board The 3 ‘personalities’ selected period four years following peoplehttpimgurcom2ZTbQRm 

Each member gets one vote If tie RBI Governor gets casting votehttpimgurcomxJT8Hi8

Every member give written statement explaining voted favouragainst resolution However proceedings Monetary Policy Committee shall remain confidentialhttpimgurcomNtBtUkW

These bare bone facts I presented You interpret whatever way want I going go ahead give take it


Democratic way functioning


Most global banks process committee decide rate monetary policies In US Federal Open Market Committee seven board members appointed President period 14 years In England MPC nine members 5 Bank England 4 appointed Minister Finance

In India debate forming MPC began February 2014 The RBI back recommended committee Five members Three RBI Two Government appointed In 2015 Government recommended committee Seven members Four Govt appointed Three RBI After much haggling powerplay seem reached compromise equal number members sides 

Jaitley mentioned Lok Sabha Finance Bill 2016 debate MPC formed consultation RBI itsallgood 

Or it

Earlier Governor incharge making right call He solely responsible bad decisions takes economy suffers result So also meant Governor much careful lowering interest rates taking major steps Now there’s committee place responsibility decisions taken would diluted six people Shared Responsibilityhttpplatostanfordeduentriescollectiveresponsibility

Let’s assume scenario resolution place lower interest rate Three people government appointees vote favour three RBI appointees including Governor vote Its tie Now governor gets casting vote Logically governor would vote keeping line first vote

But heshe decides vote favour What would exactly mean terms attributing responsibility making bad decisions There always factor new governor would someone totally favors Government takes decisions based recommendations 

Or worse takes decisions favour Government

Policy/Economy,Mohan Bhagwats Vijay Dashami Speech R,59,2i69rn,once_upon_raconteur,277,"The full speech available httpsamvadaorg2014newsfulltextofspeechbyrsssarasanghchalakmohanbhagwatonvijayadashmi2014nagpur

I read entire speech would like go point point

Today see even issue ecology discussed details past many decades yet find passing day ecological destruction approaching much faster closer us Because environmental destruction world facing newer deadlier natural calamities consistently But except changes vocabulary half hearted attempts symptomatic treatment meaningful change visible policies nations large multinational companies

Good raises issue environmental conversation As seen Uttarakhand Pune Landslide several natural calamities damaging environment catastrophic Hopefully government listening I worried doesnt seem listening Context httpqzcom255772the11environmentaldisastersnarendramodiblessedinhisfirst100days

In history past one thousand years Bharat example made genuine efforts direction path truth nonviolence  Neither questions raised one’s faith different campaigns run destroy idols worship tradition raising disputes validity respectability other’s faith basis systems restricted dictates book

Really Babri Kandhamahal happened Pakistan Furthermore arguments directed towards Abrahamic religions since follow central book However Dharmic religions India immune religious dogmatism

With similar expectations mind months ago people Bharat brought drastic change government This change government even six months old But positive signs emanating time time give hope emergence Bharat international horizon appears people’s desire life secure progressing aspects soon start reflecting governance In short period policy initiatives taken central government national interest fronts economy national security international relations many areas raised good hopes

I told nonpolitical event Why praising BJP government 

The new policy makers also take best advantage vision experience great Bharatiya leaders right tradition Swamy Vivekananda Yogi Arvind Swamy Ramtirth Gurudev Ravindra Nath Thakur Lokmanya Tilak Mahatma Gandhi Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Swatantrya Veer Savarkar Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar Acharya Vinoba Bhave Second Sarsanghachalak RSS Shri ‘Guruji’ aka Madhav Sadashiv Golvalkar  Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Jayprakash Narayan Pt Deendayal Upadhyay 

Notice even single Muslim named How people like Abdul Kalam Azad Again ties ideology 

There serious upsurge jehadi activities southern parts Bharat especially Kerala Tamil Nadu No effective policy imperatives efforts visible curbing activities  Near surrender fanatic elements appeasement policy adopted ruling parties states put life local Hindu communities law order situation well national security serious threat region 

Really Hindus way life threat Tamil Nadu Kerala Or RSS chief subtly want hint rising Muslim population states wants tie rising terrorism state 

Though alert transparent sensitive rule abiding administration necessary ending exploitation ensuring development equally important role society eradicating exploitation poor active cooperation striving democratic way end exploitation running various types help support activities order take fruits development deprived people We feel necessary put ban meat exports beef particular cow smuggling immediate future

I completely till last sentence How ban meat exports beef particular going help poor India Will eradicate one source income 

Each one us must test act whether big small simple ground member great Hindu society sondaughter Mother Bharat brother sister We must ensure Hindu temple cremation ground community water source must remain open Hindus We ensure Hindus participate functions celebrations well festivals great heroes personalities

So much RSS national entity nonHindus antinational

Since inception Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh engaged great mission building work force swayamsewaks energized pride national Hindu identity empowered inculcating great qualities personality prepared sacrifice everything even life great goal constituent dedicated disciplined organisation

Just little Hindutva

The entire speech political nature nothing Vijay Dashami He pushing India reflects RSS vision I find deeply disturbing

So used spiritual country Off top head I recall least 4 major religions began Hinduism Buddhism Jainism Sikhism Who knows probably I dont know And core religions irrespective religions followers interpreted things religions supposed GOOD About nice kind compassionate loving forgiving  

The prevalent view India west people western countries guys materialistic somehow spiritualistic I couldnt disagree  

Rather I see values virtues simple kindness love nicety acceptance love certain socalled spiritual virtues rise far amongst western world India It like people rising arms ideas racism sexism homophobia reason west Indians meanwhile still dealing Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships While kids western worlds growing accepting kids different economical background someone gaylesbian parents someone anxiety issues whathaveyou India drumming noise ancient India achieved terms scientific advances Indian culture everyone else somehow beneath us  

Now dont get wrong  I NOT trying say west perfect Indians dicks anything like Indians outside major metroes still kind helpful people Ive met  long dont discuss things piss eg religion caste system etc And yes west LONG way go become accepting look MAGA crowd whole feminist cult But said I really wonder country waking fact becoming evil day day ironically attempting tell world good virtuous ancient civilization ones vilified ignorant western people slowly leaving us behind much like tortoise tortoisehare story

These notes

 On Book

This books two people met college going married woman ran away middle engagement ceremony engaged

As author states something essential connects This easy They connected deformed ideas love shared identity could shed

She panics discuss problems idea future melts away right front And thereafter arbitrary things communicate anyone meets boyfriend takes look moved falls love And even falls love desire motivates And self absorbed way And girlfriend control 

 January 
Theres lot talk reactions gets breaks marriage Dad confused mom angry disappointed Which brings next point She really really confused ended disappointing one one disappoints ever Because always behaved like perfect daughter And perfect daughter She know image mind maintains it

Then get see first meet What realize reads lot time appearances She thinker But thinks lot Really But internal discipline truth maintenance She falls love legend He cricketer She heard cannot controlled tamed gets insecure around know behave And tries dominate Do like ignored  Rolls eyes

And scene breaks engagement She runs away middle stress building And starts thinking feeling sad keeping thoughts disappointed life general She thinks turning like unhappy sad emotionless married couples And idea freaks And control run away Even middle wants come back run save She running away instead thinking done really wants come get back So How How world possible

 February 
From lot discussion somewhat apparent resented involvement family life There psychological projection involved well Their families trying conduct affairs way know best But involvement Needhi realizes mind Which say idyllic vision marriage head world figure So image broke understand The image changed sadder got None talked anyone else  


There theme careers Abhay joined family business Needhi know life Both probably liberal arts students attracted  differences Abhay cricketer works family business So require team work Needhi independent person This kind person would something innovative grows The problem Needhi grow Even Abhay problems deal since follow rules never becomes apparent also immature Now major points Abhay self assured traditional teamplayer Needhi open new experiences independent thoughtful person gentle demeanour


Yes She existential problems life Who I Why I What I What purpose life What bring happiness All good questions ask answer worthy pursuit Here incompetent That problem She says wants weaker memory wants less control freak That remembers every little thing without able let go even control also inability let go She concept independence ends world begins She even blames Abhay loving enough stopping love breaks engagement So problem led freaking engagement discussed two months engagement someone elses fault In fact blames try stop running away even though wanted stop proof stopped loving angry running away stopping her

 March

This Abhay eMails And within email get know one thing never picks calls She accept cowardice needs explored Why pick calls Why respond texts Why respond This probably confrontational formal asked point blank Why And responds Maybe partially loves never saw way But responds loss feeling coward return calls texts And So Once self absorbed image breaks starts feel distance This would repaired creative engagement stress

She wrecked brains answer questions However Abhay talks something hints avoidance She avoids calls She avoids confrontation She avoids meeting Abhay girl avoids getting engagement Needhi avoids everything Needhi void inside avoiding

Needhi answers regarding anything Abhay concrete event precipitated change feelings Anamika kissed Abhay stop Again hints lack self regulation There two components meaning event pleasure event Both controlled different subsytems brain And meant would stop kiss go flow This created dissonance head wrecked everything apart They decide meet This probably heart heart treated intimate thoughts something built 

 April
The first thing jumps us avoids kind conversation topics matter She talk things matter point Abhay say accept I dont know answer So stupidity three months Just could avoid facing uncomfortable situations In end faced uncomfortable situation something awakened conversation Abhay They talked They talked bothering little bit love happened

She talks things make uncomfortable gets emotional absolutely refuses discuss things says point What realize point answering question Where go So keeps ruminating discussing talking things know discussion She basic conflict resolution skills All feelings know feelings 

After two discussions one March April things feels little better This things moved Abhay discussed imposed constraints Needhi accept even Anamikas kiss affected Which buried deep psyche memories came back later discussed This one things feels talk things go away

 May
May Tinder month Here meets three people The first one someone genuinely cares sees confused intimidated guides process The mistake makes ask goes telling genuinely thinks helpful She feels imposing And like Then surprised enjoyed good time She ghosts him

Then MNC guy really high She really fascinated work really enjoys discussion Now could ticket even makes mistake nothing She talks things This ofcourse mistake every one makes presentation image another person presenting image thoughts All say oh god exciting hell would broken lose

Then Dhruv Perfect guy Does everything Even stops calling tells He perfect every way feel spark And one supposed feel spark Talk Dhruv wonderful person Oh God This amazing Haha And says something And talks marriage And comforts lean And thats 

 June
They chat June start discussing things behave things normal near normal Abhay chatting simply wedding coming girlfriend Needhi takes opportunity give chance conversation life Now two understanding one talks problems simply worry coming across weak In fact signal come closer She calls breaking ice She could people not

She talking coworkers fairly self obsessed She ability talk people presents interpretation events rather talk actual facts

There talk awkwardness basically makes think hell Where maturity Talk elephant room

July 
The one thing stands Needhis need awkwardness Awkwardness assuming convention adhering needing maintain pretending nothing happens outside script For Needhis talk famillies adhering script even one adherence script Just one chooses She feels awkwardness non chalant yet friendly still overcompensate She feel easy alcohol comes solves problem Bekhuudi A disinhibited state Jaam ki zaroorat hai jaise bekhoodi ke liyey bas ek sanam chahiyey aashiqui ke liyey

Needhis friend confronts conversation whether really moved And pushes pulls Slowly She says moved maybe pretending moved There issue imposing image pretending things certain way dont know things already are

Then finally happens They see prime Abhay non challant everything course girlfriend Needhi becomes vulnerable partly already weakned state identity broken Abhay already So hungry awe Abhay And Non challant As says And weak beautiful Abhay takes look primal love reactivated And thinks love partially is

 August
She mix depression anxiety fever She thinks moving move The body different self image  She says wants something body respond Of course wont This textbook creative stress Change happen manner And point confront everything And Abhay never really gotten back would move deal everything happens

Abhay talks distant girlfriend What going mind occupied Needhi Simran automatically put backseat He keeps blabbering gave enough introduces us new concept What mean giving So one thing

She felt better run away temporarily But devastated There confront fact life would like imagined freaked Now confront fact still loves Abhay life freaks And time major something But gets without anything She basically slave feelings Later find blurts everything That does

 September
She reminiscing times together Needhi freaks always endgame mind Abhay scolds tutors lectures gets defensive But point reminiscing All good memories coming back

She admits never problems time Why Because nothing really All love enjoy feeling keep performing identity

The one thing I keep missing really badly career She shit together This form existential standpoint also fact identity work This precisely ego settle sacrifice It know do

 October
She finally gives First rumination She finds hundred reasons together finds hundred reasons together

Trust comes They trust issues yes course unable deal anything binding reality act whims 

Even though making Abhay dance tune blames kissing Anamika precipitating She takes note fact want deal suppressed memory

 November
Abhay clearly still love also torn apart He completely broken She left without explanation whim without anything really responsible towards Abhay So wants tells cannot trust made good decision fully They know decision is

Abhay made feel guilty already manipulated unknowingly making promise going wake every day trying gain trust So know idea trust emerges either The important part Needhi bad effect Abhay children discuss parents responsible adults

Their idea moving past trauma forget really bad Cheating abandoning Well What fuck Really Also I promise promise mine Mine Also What fuck Conditional love Its conditional contract

 December
She feels 19 again

They set promises one playing devils advocate

They marrying since commitments concept growth going break brutally And viciously funny book know fuck going She breaks tells marry going marry without changing anything So happened really Nothing This almost reads like episode Sillicon Valley

AskIndia,Policy Creating Jobs Indian Economy,163,66u52j,ringtring,82,"An AskIndia thread asked question I replied without reading persons entire post  turned trolling So Im reposting comment It starts historical background ends comparative description countries performed



My Answer Clothes Shoes

1 Industrialization Historically models industrialisation followed two pathways
  Slow Steady Where Western Advanced economies like USA  UK undertook economic development tandem political development They begin universal franchise This helped fiscal economic development limiting initial demands state period capacity weak
  Accelerated Growth economic successes mostly East Asia began authoritarian explicitly Korea China de facto Singapore Thailand Taiwan gave way political transformation degree economic success achieved

2 Where India Stand India attempted economic development also granting universal franchise beginning The countries group Botswana Mauritius Jamaica Trinidad Tobago Costa Rica — perennial democracies At independence India one poorest nations regardless political system per capita GDP 617 PPP This implies
  The Indian state ever burdened demands redistribution since early life  leading poor state capacity see today healthcare education law enforcement
  There distrust Private Sector overreliance Public capacity
  Exit winding declaring bankruptcy plugging inefficiencies hard diverse stakeholders vested interests poor institutions

3 What Kind Jobs India Need  India needs generate jobs formal productive provide bangforbuck terms jobs created relative investment potential broader social transformation generate exports growth Apparel Footwear sectors fit bill

4 How Apparel Footwear worked East Asian Economies In successful East Asian economies countries GDP growth booms averaged 710 per cent growth exports two sectors exceptional For comparison 20 year period postliberalisation economy
  CountryYear TakeOffAnnual avg export growth 20 years post take per cent ApparelAnnual avg export growth 20 years post take per cent Leather FootwearAnnual avg economic growth 20 years post take per cent

Malaysia197033427569
China197818627798
Vietnam198517816166
India19801275456

5 Why India underperformed For lot historical religious sociocultural reasons However pertinent contemporary times include
  Logistics Costs Time getting goods factorytoport greater Furthermore Indian ports unequipped handle large capacity containers We use Sri Lankan ports transshipments
  Labor Regulations Labor costs low regulations strangulate formalization high overtime pay requirements de facto EPF contribution taxes lowpaid workers inflexible firing policies

  Tax Tariff Policies Indias domestic tax policies unbalanced promote cottonbased fibres instead manmade fibres bulk global demand Similarly global demand nonleather footwear Indias share global exports leather footwear double nonleather footwear ie wrongly focuses leather footwear

  Export Market Discrimination EU US impose customs tariffs Indian apparel footwear exports 10 0 Bangladesh So Indian firms shift operations outside India

AskIndia,Well articulated anti congress Whatsapp forward Bhakton ki nayi peshkash,2,7zckca,Bikihuigormint,5,"


Received family whatsapp group

A brilliant answer Bala Senthil Kumar question answered popular QA site Quora

 What view saying Congress looted India 70 years

It isnt looting wealth bothers much sheer fact Congress merely replaced Brits ways  became masters broken weak people simply willing suck authority Nobody gave India confidence This part bothers much especially MK Gandhis style winning us freedom giving enemy higher moral ground

So India grown apologetic impotent nation children taught revere impractical passive cowardly notions like nonviolence everything nature tells us fight survive Of course I know philosophy fighting strong But comes mastery shamelessly bowing masters

So saw change guard The Brits went new masters came form Congress Party Hierarchies remained class system remained subservience remained Where heck dynamism go

Then thrown socialist mindset people waiting alms government wealth redistribution programs instead empowered We got protectionist policies prevented prosperity competition throwing us away path meritocracy Hindustan Motors started around time Toyota Tata Steel started around time Nippon Steel Nippon Steel produces around five times much Tata Steel without native resources ore No need talk Hindustan Motors Toyota Japan coming twin nuclear strikes devastated way India Brits Do need compare different growth paths two nations been

Only thousands died start Green Revolution Only China attacked us realize need become militarily stronger Only backs wall India liberalize economy Under Congress every move made towards kind development come inevitable circumstances backs wall

India never allowed truly independent strong proud peoples full potential No wonder many us left droves thrived various countries elsewhere This loot I would feel wronged  denying India best talents minds didnt create conditions dignified development

Incredibly immense sacrifices fighting heroes also swept aside avalanche worship Gandhiji Why So Brits would feel good The Congress party reporting British Intelligence 5 years became independent country Subhash Boses familys movements During criminal probe Bofors scandal Congress External Affairs minister delivered letter foreign body deny evidence cooperation Indian investigating agency Years later whole bunch Congress members cronies used letterhead Indian Parliament petition USA issue visa Narendra Modi man would become Prime Minister 

The Congress clear obsession white people need constantly please When Hillary Clinton asked India wean Iranian oil Congress government promptly obliged even though Iran India close friends long time No surprise pasta aunty Italy supremo Think would got respect Nigerian black woman I dont think Thats deeply ingrained slave mentality ranks Congress

It loot Indias pride dignity dynamism die hard spirit bothers much much loot wealth This country produced enough wealth support British Empire 200 years It easily produce much ensure prosperity health well people This abundant powerful country prevented developed forward thinking awesome nation could example world

If India weak apologetic nation long precisely Congress Why put weasels fools aligning I could even tolerate ruthless despotic dictatorial mindset It slimy backstabbing self serving Lutyens mindset really irks I would give anything destroy smugness decimate put firmly behind us

The economic loot nothing compared bloody well make pay it

AskIndia,The long fascinating story Dadra Nagar Haveli got integrated India,18,25ix5m,iKidA,2,"India big complicated country big complicated history This means reasonably efficient attempt trying make sense Indian history must unfortunately gloss hundreds thousands little stories went making modern India Take instance liberation Dadra Nagar Haveli

 On night July 22 1954 group nearly fifteen volunteers United Front Goans UFG leadership freedom fighters Francis Mascarenhas Vaman Desai assembled outside border discuss details assault They marched across border approached Dadra around midnight When neared police station recognised subinspector Aniceto Rosario archenemy He responsible ill treatment UFG members police custody Daman sought revenge At time addressing group 100 150 villagers warning illegal entry outsiders fields They also told disobeying orders would met serious consequences The volunteers managed crawl village mixed locals assembled meeting The remaining went round began close behind police station

Much violence followed More herehttpwwwnavhindtimesinilivehow18thjuneroadgotitsname And newspaper clipping herehttpnewsgooglecomnewspapersnid1755dat19540724idwXUjAAAAIBAJsjidsL4EAAAAIBAJpg56733493515

Two weeks later Nagar Haveli also captured liberators declared little enclave Free Dadra And Nagar Haveli independent country international recognition course run proIndian government called Varishtha Panchayat Some time afterwards Panchayat asked India help run enclave 
 In response requests Varishta Panchayat Administrator NagarAveli Dr A Furtado proposed resign Government India agreed make available services senior officer Indian Administrative Service Administrator areas Shri K G Badlani took new Administrator effect 17 October 1960 It also proposed elect new Panchayat replace present Panchayat consists nominees This new Panchayat would act Legislative Council liberated areas

From Ministry External Affairs report herehttpmealibnicinpdf2487000 PDF

Meanwhile Portuguese government took India International Court Justice The court passed judgement upheld Portuguese claim sovereign territory overrun curiously passed another judgement prevented Portuguese actually anything Indian invasion  Copy judgement herehttpwwwicjcijorgdocketfiles324521pdf PDF

Understandably countries insisted ruling went respective favour

Thus seven years 1954 1961 Free Dadra Nagar Haveli existed state political limbo nicely helped along government India Mr Badlani

And 1961 Portuguese India fallen annexed Indian forces DNH requested merged India The popular telling happened next follows DNH quickly created legislature elected IAS officer KG Badlani Prime Minister Dadra Nagar Haveli one day That day signed territory Republic India And handover formalized tenth amendment Indian Constitution Amendment details herehttpmail01tinyletterappcomNowHereThisnowherethis6107667316410047134intranetcaiapdfc66b2a0b7a1c64faa8c152659fdd94b72 PDF

As person emigrated Germany I want chip personal view takes make come back India 

tldr I wont back May future

Long version

uozonised compiled good list issues exists improved

Infrastructure I come Hyderabad capital city infrastructure shit It took 10 years massive amount build metro top metro underground The roads already congested fools installed metro pillars roads congesting even The city sewage still Nizams era nothing substantial done improve Every year rainy season roads buildings submerged water

Ride bike one hour take clean cloth swipe face black layer come Thats pollution city Auto public busses emit black gases exhaust You literally breathing shit day day Just creating better transportation make place livable You need plan future build something sustainable There greenery city becoming concrete jungle Every year I visit Hyd I regret roaming streets black smoke

Please make city livable Yesterday news cutting trees Aarey park mumbai make way Metro We need progress build infrastructure considering nature way round It takes strong inspectmake every person riding vehicle follows correct emission standards

Healthcare  
Healthcare completely different topic Last year challenge get MRI Cervical Spondylosis problem father asked get done Osmania Hospital I visited 20 days tried get appointment Neuro doctor MRI without paying bribe sadly I gave got done private hospital

Have ever visited pregnant ward govt hospital If dont puke I would congratulate Imagine women carrying child 9 months delivering among 20 women congested room pathetic conditions Healthcare literally knees

 Did know 2 years back Indian mangoes banned germany using chemicals ripe 

You know done Just good officer good inspection keep premises clean healthy Checkout amsterdam cycling documentaries govt responded public demand created cycling infrastructure people bikle freely resulting massive decline health problems

Academics 
The plight private schools looting parents came mainstream due Delhi govt Kudos bringing awareness Private schools robbing public schools getting closed due lack funds Govt money run schools make 3k crore statue I saw days back UP school serving rice salt midday meal Are fucking pathetic situation give currydal rice future generations Dont get started quality education Why cant govt schools English subject Why teach regional language I saw many govt school students confident start college

In Germany I study free PG I work professors also get paid handsomely I research You know student I pay 52€4000 INR one semester6 months take part play many times Open following link chrome translate httpshsphhsportunihamburgdesportangprogrammhtm It would mind boggling know every student city take part many sports You would overwhelmed see sport infrastructure country I never played sport except cricket thankfully Germany I played many sports cant even imagine almost free 

You also take many courses want paying 110€8k INR 6 months When earn 25k€ every month 110€ 6 months nothing Why would I leave come back nothing I get sick breathing shitty air

Policies Check startup culture Berlin Munich area In India many IITs lakhs students graduating every year What stopping Govt creating Startup fund make policies encourage fresh minds create fresh Ideas They startup fund I guess gone wind 

Me My elder brother younger sister CS students We actually working startup would headquartered Germany branch India Do know get better funding exposure fucking awesome Every city Startup hacksmeetupspitches I dont want start startup red tape Indian bureaucracy To honest Its shame country like India lagging behind Startup world

Employment Better startup policies better infrastructure better education directly leads creating opportunities No magic wand I 20s working company lakhs people like sadly working shitty 95 job big company Just look around see jobs created Zomato Swiggy cash brought market consumers Imagine startups like massive scale It would change face country Our economy needs open welcoming

My brother used work East Asia came back India regrets every day The daily commute traffic jams pollution literally killing As first comment umrfreeze2000 says There two types people emigrate better paylifestyle better work I Emigrated You know Its Illegal make work Sat  Sunday If exceptional situation arises I work Saturday company get permission Labour office

 I get 6 weeks Paid holidays  public holidays
 I travel 27 countries Just pack bags hop car Los gehts
 I get PR working 3 years 2 years German B1 certificate No Shitty visa issues like US A 
 I become German citizen 68 years
 I take many sickness leaves want Its right I dont saying
 If wife working expecting child gets 14fourteen months paid maternity leave As father also take paternity leave
 My whole family covered Health insurance covering fever cancer 
 Children go awesome schools learn take music subject sport free
 If I ever got fired I get arbeitslosengeldJob Loss money 15 years I guess
 Better infrastructure better health Hospitals better care better money better air 

Lastly I guess written nonmuslim personsorry bring Religion As muslim father urges come back India ever given cancer spread recent years I desis saying face antinational paki Germany least I expect India I stopped going Indian festival gatherings I fear dickhead ask I came intention Some years back I could trust fellow Indians I lost hope Just reference check tweet httpstwittercomrohinisghstatus1180165971006197765 cancer country acquired You dont know humiliation facing days Every damn thing turned whataboutery The current regime spined propaganda minority appeasement What minority appeasement muslims situation worse SCSTs without reservation

Sports,Key Points From Draft New Education Policy 2019,693,bwb5ao,gryphus-scarface,248,"Link  httpsmhrdgovinsitesuploadfilesmhrdfilesDraftNEP2019ENRevisedpdf

The document 3 parts

1 School Education

2 CollegeUniversity Education

3 Additional Key Focus Areas

In interest keeping discussions focussed understandable I split 3 posts
This part 1

Part 2 httpsoldredditcomrindiacommentsbx1lr7keypointsfromtheneweducationpolicy2019


Summary

This policy easily biggest change education system since old policy came It many ways entirely unrecognisable many ways simply formalising informally already done

The first biggest change primary education ages 36 formal part school education public school must offer The second change goes hand hand abolishing 102 system In many ways 102 system completely ignored way students mind developed thus made poor learning system The new system 5334 These stages follows

 5 years Foundational Stage 3 years preprimary school Grades 1 2

 3 years Preparatory Latter Primary Stage Grades 3 4 5

 3 years Middle Upper Primary Stage Grades 6 7 8

 4 years High Secondary Stage Grades 9 10 11 12

The new Foundational stage supposedly meant age fluid Your age matter long within age group 38 The Policy recommends foundation stage textbook based education instead play based activity based education It also emphasises introducing variety new stimuli force childrens brains develop holistic manner These stimuli include  music classical modern singing listening art regional national sketching etc literature folk tales literature region national quality authors modern classical This massive departure present system new emphasis arts excellent To add new bilingual policy introduced Students learn languages shown much better cognitive abilities dont new system makes students learn 2 languages right start One mother tongue order preserve The language may vary region requirements The three language policy remains better enforced The final changes primary education integration anganwadis schools shifting primarily health workers full scale trained teachers satisfying needs students The NEP requires full development peopleskills variety things like weekly assemblies daily showandtells This improves speaking ability something IMO Indian students historically terrible New extras include group reading stories learning morality ethics along proper framework puzzle solving various types etc make sure child significantly better development Students fall behind left instead teachers required identify help studies suggest students fall back early almost never recover

The next Preparatory stage lays emphasis shifting informal style Foundation stage formal textbook oriented education Middle stage It bridge stage Please policy emphasises technical education must take place native language mother tongue first This students learn mother tongue noticeable advantage learn say English The policy also good writeup emphasis English hurt India lot The preparatory stage also keeps focus arts expects students fully develop skills beyond textbook education The policy also demands abolishing called cocurricular activities instead integrating core curriculum This makes things like PE yoga art music core part education It also requires every student specialise least one subjects Another new concept selection best students help worst students The best students selected teacher become part sort national training system

The third stage Middle Stage By time students mind would developed enough It time start fully formal education Subjects start splitting generic versions detailed subjects like science  physics  chemistry  biology Students point slowly start also learn technical subjects English The idea students able think mother tongue lot advantages able understand present ideas English

The fourth final stage High Stage At point students developed lot Their mind starts thinking bigger picture mode start planning rest life In order support students allowed freely select courses specialise They still required understand complete art courses paramount abilities regardless final courses choose

Some important courses come 12 years include  course ethics morality Indian languages history regional literature

The next major changes come school management system Schools form complexes A complex comprised nearby schools complex whole offers stages Complexes given funds resources like teachers These resources may split among schools necessary This important types teachers relatively rare thus provides optimal utilisation resources Sometimes resources like libraries may also shared The exact details shared vary depending schools locality population density backwardness population

Schools also get new level autonomy previously missing Teachers allowed final deciders courses taught

In order improve attendance schools number things Depending area buses may provided Roads redone transport easier Older students provided free bicycles The mid day meals also extended offer basic breakfast students Adequate safe infrastructure including working toilets clean drinking water clean attractive spaces conducive learning electricity computing devices internet important provide schools

To reduce inequality primary goal new policy In order school complex committee overseeing demographics students arent attending Specific groups called include Muslims unwillingness attend women general The policy requires people castes religions integrated schools The teachers also required emphasise equality preventing acts discriminate eg allowing SCSTs sit upper caste students etc The schools required join community eradicating inequality They required talk parents try change behaviour This could groundwork eliminating reservation system The policy sets target 2030 majority students equalised pulling richer higher caste pulling poorer downtrodden Special Education Zones set disadvantaged regions across country The Central government support extra investment perchild expenditure ratio 21 rupee spent State Zones A special National Fund created specifically providing scholarships developing resources facilities students Under Represented Groups

The next set changes aimed teachers The primary aims improve teacher pay status society It recognises teachers already heavily burdened lot work government work may offloaded onto teachers They also educated better stricter standards set Teachers required reeducate joining workshops vertical mobility teacher improved Teacher education gradually moved multidisciplinary colleges universities By 2030 minimum degree qualification teaching fouryear liberal integrated BEd degree teaches range knowledge content pedagogy
Developmental opportunities form local State national international teaching subject workshops well online teacher development modules available teachers Substandard standalone Teacher Education Institutions TEIs across country shut soon possible New teachers register authority quickly shifted school complex integration schools necessary

The next major changes comes testing system The new system run National Testing Agency newly set 2017 entrance exams They conducting tests new tests like aptitude tests  They deemphasise rote learning instead encouraging understanding subject The policy claims 2020 schools internet connected computers It thus pushes degree digitisation allowing continuous evaluation computers Board exams 10th 12th longer Instead exams 3rd 5th 8th called Census exams The idea reduce importance Board exams Teachers also involved governance schools school complexes

This policy also paves way better recognition top talent students For eg student really good Math attending special summer schools improve performance As already mentioned top students also required tutor students hard time coping There also new emphasis Olympiads This improve Indias ranks international competitions

The RTE act sees changes It extended full duration school ages 318 The RTE act reviewed policy notes

As private institutions misinformation Private institutions undergo changes similar system reach students The main changes fees regulated Fees needs rationalised cant arbitrarily high Once set fee increments must go inline inflation reasonable increases opposed random increases Schools also required law nonprofit must verified regularly submitting financial details Private schools also prohibited word public name So prepared see lot name changes

Schools also accredited regulated slightly free manner However required release details public A framework guidelines ensuring school safety security children developed made part eligibility conditions school education institution recognition registration Every principal teacher made aware provisions relevant Acts Rules Regulations etc relating child rights constitutes violation including module teachers’principals’ educationtraining programmes refresher courses Selflearning online programmes child rights developed benefit students teachers parents Credible mechanisms students report breaches rights appropriate actions taken perpetrators developed implemented collaboration local police The Adolescent Education Programme National Population Education Programme integrated curriculum schools phased manner please note Adolescent Education Programme sex education

Also addition alternative forms schools like gurukulas patashalas madrassas encouraged long follow modernised syllabus fully transparent

The first changes implemented 2020 major changes place 2022 The first benefits seen 2025 2030 fully transitioned benefits place


Comparison With Current System

The existing system failed primarily 2 ways Languages poorly integrated many schools even offer three languages policy notes Hindi speaking states TN primary offenders Now students required learn languages per Three Language Formula The way old system failed testing NCF 2005 laid heavy focus eliminating rote learning introducing system discovery based education encouraged The 10th grade NCERT textbook science testament Yet system failed tests cared well student could mug vomit arbitrary facts The new policy try fix much improve remains seen

The minor ways failed integration extra curricular subjects Many schools actually refused teach subjects considering time waste The new system makes core part education system improvement

Please discuss doubts feel free ask


TLDR

1 Learning learn

2 Mother tongue primary language learning

3 Focus trilingual policy English longer primary language

4 Equality students

5 Arts Sports Music literature etc primary importance student specialise one addition courses choice

6 Digital Education

7 Freedom choice higher stage education

8 Board exams removed favour frequent census exams

9 Testing focus aptitude understanding frequent tests la CCE CBSE

10 102 eliminated favour 5334 full focus primary 38 years education",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwb5ao/key_points_from_the_draft_new_education_policy/

Sports,Bala movie A mix new old Analysis,16,du8jny,nibirdeka,4,"I expecting nothing movie Bala majorly 2 things First I checked twitter found people negative reviews well Twitter negative everything days secondly I walk movie Dreamgirl I like Ayushmann I found Dreamgirl pretty average movie felt like culmination comedy circus scenes Thus I sceptical

I totally wrong Bala Ayushmann khurana trademark movie Ofcourse director Amar Kaushik entire cast responsible success But movie merely good script selection Ayushmann marvelous job frustrated insecured bald guy I could relate frustration The portrayal realistic 

Now directly coming themes movie touches Contains Spoilers

1 Insecurities  The movie uses Baldness primarily dark complexion insecurities people world hellbent shaming It sees Baldness skin tone completely different way Baldness touching masculine charm skin colour determining feminine side It explores two ideas 

Another insecurity explores millennials quest enhanced pseudo identity social media platforms Bala gets upset baldness thinks presentable Instagram Tiktok The material socialisation social media long get likes videos intellectual brainstorming statuses etc Yami Gautams character comes frame viral star modeling aspirations

2 Status quo  Javed Jaffrey remarks movie looks dont matter men patriarchal society marriage girl stay husband irrespective choice cause tied In marriage constantly challenges notion Bhumi Pednekar lawyer encourages women leave ger husband justifying husbands cheating weight Yami Gautam files divorce suit finds Bala bald lied hair It tries break away marital trap women 

3 Religion  Bollywood attempted touch religion films like PK OMG Balas addressing religion inclusive Initially criticises Lord Krishna beautifing dark toned fair skinned girl In end analyses situation completely different way Krishna trying change fair skin Lord trying make realise beautiful This positive interpretation understanding Indias religious practices commendable many times associate reformation total denunciation religion Indias secularism always plurality separation church religion state

4 Pop culture

It touches upon pop culture shames dark skinned women mocking certain Bollywood songs It doesnt resort blame game time subtle misogyny evident everywhere rather tries remind us subconsciously indoctrinated thought beauty means fair

5 Staying true yourself

Both women lead true archetype Bhumi although felt upset kid shamed dark doesnt let affect way life She finds social media irrelevant project different self tries live life ideals Yami hand product social media She aware beauty appeal uses build brand around tiktok like modern day influencer She admits externalities way life without nothing That bedroom scene Ayushmann much needed theres nerd culture developed shames people much  So someone uploads selfie Tiktok video Can mind business dont like If one self aware potential knows market exploiting social media sin It still better hypocrite Ayushmann tries fake Yami faking She aware externality aspect 

6 Activism The best cinematic aspect Bala movie preachy It subtle activism It doesnt call names direct blame highlights normalisation practices Like fairness obsession body shaming even new ones like social medias edited reality It depicts shallowness filmy Balas need gratification comes fact wants emulate Bollywood behaviour 

7 High school nostalgia Bala tried hard hair back appreciation received school A lot people stuck school days particular identity school Some good sports later ended deadbeat job case Bala popular kid class People obsessed highschool nostalgia want go back days escape monotony employment real life offers

The important point Is Bala traditional Bollywood hero Well Bala certain flaws He bald Btown hero rarely He insecured Our heroes maybe big time fraud films never insecured Bala different Bollywood hero Bala doesnt get girl He gets rejected Bhumi love someone else Also doesnt follow Bollywood style falling love second girl read rebound movies Kuch Kuch Hota Hain Yammi ends divorcing Bala

But follows conventional hero arc end Because movie Balas victory insecurities It catharcis last fairness cream presentation It reversal fortune average comedian well loved one He follows athenian ideal hero way Except doesnt visit underground Bhumi feels sympathetic towards Bala fights case initially felt like loves benefit doubt fighting well might relate Balas baldness way suffered societical taunting skin tonned

Bala might deviated mainstream Bollywood norms althout commercial movie adheres policy The Indian Hero resurgence

Let start education

Our curriculum  innovation creativity killed trained educated way work huge MNCs operated westerners Individuality killed people corrupted sheep mentality Higher education big joke country pursue masters post docs couldnt land jobmost cases We still slave mindset within us  want work someone doesnt matter like job work get paidThe syllabus designed british still following it

Moving economy

India Pakistan cheapest countries live world africanot venezuela India What essentially means go country wealth possess India become poorer httpspoorerNo  No wonder Americans use Indians cheap labour Even cheapest country live  many living poverty line speaks lot wealth distribution country All come stats regarding GDP please lookup GDP per person thats essentially matters

We call secular country ram mandir dispute constantly made headlines Let honest I dont care wins regarding really priority cant wait progressed important areas healthcare bad condition state BPL people pathetic want construct temple anyways Im asking build hospitals place instead temple thats foolishness makes sense cant spend healthcare education first afterwards think temple

The defense budget 318 lakh crore great army powerful second largest government fails realize biggest war happening inside India We spend much preparing war countries fail fight internal problems Why cant budget healthcare education increased reducing budget defense Now might argue countries like USA spend large defense difference already developed dont much problems within whereas still third world country

All media hype surrounding India rising superpower complete bogus want us believe making progress make good use pathetic situation The real rising superpower china look technological advancements  

Moving sports 

The popular sport India cricket Now let remind cricket introduced british us still play game widely moved sports cricket number one sport 2 countries  India pakistan ruled british We indirectly still slaves play sport gave us even 100 years 

Having population 14billion representation olympics wont even equal countries population less 10 million Thats pathetic condition sports India

People dont care dont watch dont play sports simply arent told refrain playing others mentality changes progress sports cant blame government funding people arent watching fund 

Moving women safety

Women safety big joke India Indian culture teaches us respect women situation pathetic

Clearly lack education lack sex education

We wrote kamasutra talking sex taboo Indian schools treat sex foreign topic schools outright skips topic When say sex taboo increases curiosity mind people people crave dont getunderstand like adding oil fire bollywood movies objectifying women corrupts weak minded thus give sexual feelings  

Sex education important understand control ones feelings 

I created Fake facebook id womans picture profile picture I got 879 friend requests within day indians I got 100 pms asking nude pics This level desperation ultimately lead becoming rapists molesters NohttpsmolestersNo   wonder women dislike Indian men

And finally I want end bollywood

Sports,People RIndia Let’s talk Narcissistic personality disorder abusive relationships I put experience Would like know people experiences things went recovered,63,c3otkm,tez_launda,57,"  

A months back I posted question rIndia seek people’s opinions experience broken engagement In post I mentioned experiences happened vague 

Putting things perspective engagement ended simply I shared past struggles future career ambitions ‘to wife’fiancée  Struggles general related sports injury past relationship career decisions My sole motivation let know past first I honest wanted ‘to be’ know marriage Practically speaking can’t discuss weaknesses struggles insecurities SO definitely something wrong relationship

Anyway previous post many people replied Most said I dodged bullet held responsible whatever happened

Now coming present I closure Moved better things life But days months post breaking engagement really really horrible A nightmare I wish one go through

What I realized almost 5 months I went Narcissistic Abuse All time I suffering thinking something wrong I responsible events But girl fiancée covert narcissist They worst kind human ever stay world This inference psychologists Almost 45 months ending engagement one day I simply browsing internet abusive relationship word popped narcissism It struck like big slap face The realisation came I went ditto 100  match someone endures narcissistic relationship  

A brief account happened pre post engagement 

It simple case arranged Indian marriage Girl’s family keen marriage Initially girl presented charming acceptable match Only issue take things slowly I asked marrying said I honest mature etc etc I everything wants prospective partner Also wants continue job can’t cook want go office party booze support parents financially etc I cool everything I even support parents since parent 

But suddenly 23 weeks slowly things changed She slowly started avoiding communication started telling lies blatant manipulation showed controlling behaviour became passive aggressive She would give silent treatment nowhere We supposed go together work city home town get engaged next day back During whole journey 67 hrs one side talked Just acted I committed crime When I asked what’s wrong said everything fine I reacting She acted totally normal front other

In end I knew something wrong I asked parents side meet sort issue Here said She said I worry lot I take much tension I mamma’s boy I work govt sector want someone IT I 4 years older wants someone age I immature I fun I nerd etc etc She used past experiences spin around real issues She blamed still affair ex blamed physical relationship past said I low confidence Her father questioned confidence I able job responsibility Her mother told daughter love marriage I make feel safe In end compared Karela bitter vegetable mostly one likes said karela compared mango  She put statement WA dp pointing towards “why mean coz I thought If I look unapproachable approach me”

How I realised narcissist 

She said feels emotions Her twins bio clearly mentions narcissistic She master manipulator pathological liar I caught many number times extreme abusive personality Blamed mother scolding mother never The classic stages narc relationship case Initial charm slow manipulation torture reason final discard everything blamed I undergone therapy wards couple psychologist psychiatrist All pointed issues mental state Nothing wrong expect damaged till brinks destruction She said beginning temper issues People perceive excessive attitude She extremely jealous people She never said anything good friends She made sure I don’t meet one friend colleague She never shared anything deep although asked everything When I asked would immediately change topics There many mind fukkary  

Anyway I moved The scars always haunt whole experience actually changed better As I know I pretty chill guy quiet fun actually real traveller achieved lot life also works “Gazetted Officer GOI” She works associate American bank biryani city  After I went dating spree met almost 56 girls Many said one thing sure I good heart I need preserve 

Would like know anyone experienced narcissism NPD firsthand experiences For proper mental disorder people NPD epitome soul destroying bth

I absolutely NOT want pay notice period shortfall

How I go this



It indeed long please read details

The sequence events summary

1 I resigned official email date 1st January 2019 requested relieving date Manager
2 My Manager confirmed resignation acceptance  proposed last working day 28th February 2019 email HR copy
3 Per discussion Manager I completed handover projectsdocumentation I complete last work day formalities  wait full final settlement
4 On March 25th HR tells I pay notice period shortfall waiver 1 month citing notice period contract 3 months  I served 2 months 
5 I try explain date NOT proposed I followed notice period advised manager  discussed  manager
6 They say  Whatever written contract takes precedence Moreover HR cites Manager explicitly mention email notice period waived I pay I clear dues retirals processed
7 Furthermore HR says matter upto discretion management  Management  Centre head premises I worked at
8 My manager spineless I brought levelup manager American communication chain  I would meeting centre head 910 days India right now



x200B

I worked company past 6 years Out total 11 years total work experienceThe company Indian division giant European MNC

About decade ago Indian division mostly manufacturing facility Gujarat

Our centre head someone veteran setup  mostly runs centre basis factorydrivenmindset loads hierarchy  well set grooves network managers  
That MNC functions outside India PL centre shows profit every year I guess counterparts dont interfere

Since I received Notice period shortfall recovery email HR March 2019 I escalating issue  seeking waiver since suggestion 2 month notice period

x200B

HR Managers manager overall input It small amount You part ways good note

The HR managers manager borderline threatened escalation with

Do want us tell get call background check anytime future

x200B

He also mentioned process follow  ultimate discretion lies management now

So I figured pointless talking himI digging ITSystems charge fellow resigned recently He served notice period  whatever reason manager let go 2 days earlier record emailStill asked pay 2 days worth notice period recovery amount dues clearedHe paid since supposed leave abroad next job  small amount didnt want hold larger settlement dues that



It simply blows mind company like actually hell bent making money notice period shortfalls especially parting mutual  hasnt even caused business harmloss lack transfer work

I absolutely NOT want pay notice period shortfallHow I go this

I thinking about

1 Writing ombudsperson reporting helpline intercompany disputes  get global heat this
2 Writing many functional head  Global HR email addresses I gather get escalated much cannot pressed down
3 Getting lawyers opinion I would really like avoid legal proceeding since would call lot work time money

India How rich nation became poor rich again

Essays  March 19 2007  1238

Developing Cultures  Case Studies coedited Peter Berger Laurence Harrison Routledge 2005

Does culture way help explain fact Indian economy stagnating first fifty years 20th century began grow respectable clip 1980 amongst fastest growing world end century

Consider following hundred year trend 1900 1950 Indian economy grew average 08 percent year population also grew rate thus net growth income per capita nil rightly called colonial economy stagnant After Independence economic growth picked 35 percent 1950 1980 population growth 22 percent hence net affect income 13 percent per capita mournfully referred “the Hindu rate growth” Things began change modest liberalization eighties annual economic growth rose 56 percent This happy trend continued reform decade nineties growth averaged 62 percent year population slowed 18 percent thus per capita income rose decent 44 percent year

As benchmark recall Wests industrial revolution took place 3 percent GDP growth 11 percent per capita income growth 1820 To appreciate magnitude Indian change 1980 let illustrate If Indias per capita GDP continued growing pre1980 level income would reached present American capita income levels 2250 continues grow post1980 rate reach levels 2066 gain 184 years

How one begin explain Indias economic performance past hundred years The Indian nationalist blames first fifty years stagnation British colonialism But trade economist counter showing world economy also stagnant first half 20th century especially World War I world per capita GDP grew annually one percent2 The main culprits would say conflict autarky Disgraceful protectionism governments Wars slowed world Indian economy

Although Indian economy picked 1950 neoclassical economist would argue performed world economy experienced “golden age” driven trade expansion 1971 Like rest Third World India benefit global trade expansion closed economy pursued import substitution Moreover Nehrus socialism shackled economy fierce controls private sector pejoratively called Licence Raj hence annual GDP growth 15 percentage points even Third World average 1950 19803

This changed dramatically modest liberal reforms 1980s sweeping ones 1990s Indian economy integrated world In twenty years outperformed world economy significantly amongst fastest world4 Thus gradual technological diffusion rising capital accumulation productivity gradual education expansion help economists explain good deal story There also value time accumulated learning time “Collective learning” Hayeks term applied cumulative experience generations build embodied language technology way things5

But economic explanations enough That India adopted democracy 1950 capitalism 1991 also significant democracys redistributive pressures free power farmers subsidies dampened growth also explain Indias reform process painfully slow Economists also find puzzling liberal institutions British Raj engender faster growth colonial years The rule law relative peace Pax Brittanica nondirigiste administration railways canals—all market friendly moves all

I believe national confidence also plays important role The damaging impact colonialism may well Indian minds—it created inferiority complex recently recovered Douglass North rightly emphasized importance beliefs6Businessmen understand value confidence entrepreneurial success creating climate investment Historians emphasize power selfbelief national successRoman history Britains rise 19th century examples After Independence Indias confidence certainly rose especially democracy took root flawed economic institutions Nehruvian socialism damaged confidence Once socialist institutions began replaced capitalist ones Reform period confidence returned young Indian minds finally became decolonized I traveled extensively across India 1990s I discovered changed mood I think also explains current economic success7

I shall amplify arguments taking reader galloping tour Indian economic history From story I shall draw lessons role institutions culture development En passant I shall touch upon great questions Indian history British impoverish India Why didnt railways engender industrial revolution Did Nehrus socialism dampen Indias progress What consequence democracy preceding capitalism

Lets begin Mughals

Indias nationalist historians portrayed precolonial economy golden age prosperity fabulous wealth set Europeans great voyages discovery8 During Mughal Empire end 16th century Indias wealth indeed sustain 100 million people With plenty arable land agriculture certainly productive Western Europes even subsistenceoriented peasant got decent return9 India also large skilled workforce produced cotton also luxuries aristocracy Consequently economy produced large financial surplus used support growing Mughal Empire finance spectacular monuments like Taj Mahal10

In 1497 Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama flotilla four ships find Indias wealth But twoyear voyage commercial success Indians interested European clothes goods made far ones India But Da Gama told King Manuel Portugal large cities large buildings rivers great populations He spoke spices jewels precious stones “mines gold” He believed found Indias legendary wealth11

It took English hundred years discover wealth Initially came plunder soon discovered rewards trade They found India produced worlds best cotton yarn textiles enormous quantities12 What Indians wanted exchange Europeans gold silver insatiable appetite Hence constant flow gold India absorbed good deal bullion mined Spaniards New World Having learned cotton textiles India English turned tables brought industrial revolution Britain destroyed lives millions Indian weavers

India leading manufacturer 18th century

India leading manufacturing country world early 18th century It 226 percent share worlds GDP came around 16 percent 1820 closer share world population13 It developed banking system vigorous merchant capital network agents brokers middlemen Given enormous financial surplus skilled artisan class large exports plenty arable land reasonable productivity question didnt modern industrial economy emerge India Instead India become impoverished

Despite dynamic growing commercial sector responded market forces extensive foreign trade truth 18th century India significantly behind Western Europe technology institutions ideas Neither agricultural revolution scientific revolution occurred long run manual skill Indian artisan could substitute technological progress”14 and would needed new attitudes Notwithstanding surplus trade mideighteenth India “per capita product perhaps twothirds England France”15

There easy answer problem country prosperous people poor One explanation even 18th century India large population plenty cheap labor Prosperity comes rising productivity rise productivity depends technology When supply labor elastic economical hire people invest machines Hence Englishman observed 1807 “In India seldom attempt made accomplish anything machinery performed human labour”16 There easy answer problem country prosperous people poor One explanation even 18 century India large population plenty cheap labor Prosperity comes rising productivity rise productivity depends technology When supply labor elastic economical hire people invest machines Hence Englishman observed 1807 “In India seldom attempt made accomplish anything machinery performed human labour”

Did British Raj impoverish India

Indias nationalist historians blamed British Raj Indias poverty The classic nationalist case India rich British came colonialism weakened agriculture “deindustrialized” India throwing millions artisans work Britains trade policies encouraged import manufactures export raw materials finally drained wealth India transferring capital Britain

Nationalists claimed Lancashires new textile mills crushed Indias handloom textile industry threw millions weavers work Indias textile exports plunged leadership position start Britains Industrial Revolution fraction The indigenous banking system financed exports also destroyed Since colonial government erect tariff barriers Indian consumers shifted cheaper English millmade cloth millions handloom workers left misery British colonial rule “deindustrialised” India favorite nationalist phrase exporter textiles India became exporter raw cotton17

Britain also changed old land revenue system disadvantage farmer pay revenue whether monsoon failed This led famines The worst one 189697 affected 96 million lives killed estimated 5 million people Although railways helped trade food crops enlarged national market sucked away peasants surplus earlier stored bad years Moreover British government transferred surplus revenues back England Since India consistently exported imported second half 19th century early 20th century Britain used Indias trade surplus finance trade deficit rest world pay exports India capital repayments London This represented massive drain Indias wealth18

In recent years historians challenged nationalist picture They argued Indian industrys decline 19th century caused technology The machines Britains industrial revolution wiped Indian textiles way traditional handmade textiles disappeared Europe rest world Fifty years later Indian textile mills would destroyed Indias weavers thus victims technological obsolescence19

They also found land tax exorbitant—by 1900 5 percent agricultural output half average per capita tax burden There “drain wealth” 15 percent GNP every year The revisionist historians argued Indias payments Britain real military civilian services service capital investments Also overhead cost British establishment—the called “home charges”—was fact quite small20 If India army navy would spent True India balance payments surplus Britain used finance part deficit India compensated import gold silver went private Indian hands

India begins reindustrize

Indian entrepreneurs began set modern textile mills 1850 slowly began recapture domestic market In 1896 Indian mills supplied 8 total cloth consumed India 1913 20 1936 62 1945 7621Although India participate global trade expansion 1870 1913 Indian businessmen made large profits First World War reinvested war Thus Indias manufacturing output grew 56 percent per year 191338 well world average 33 percent” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection 1920s helped industrialists expand diversify

By Independence 1947 Indian entrepreneurs strong position buy businesses departing British Industrys share Indias GNP doubled 38 percent 1913 75 percent 1947 share manufactures exports rose 224 percent 1913 30 percent 1947

Why didnt industrial revolution occur

One intriguing questions history India failed create industrial revolution Karl Marx predicted railways would transform India usher industrial revolution Indeed First World War thought ready takeoff By 1914 India third largest railway network worlds largest jute manufacturing industry fourth largest cotton textile industry largest canal system 25 percent world trade23Although colony liberal regulatory regimefar investor friendly one replaced Independence—and 1920s infant industry also favored tariffs It merchant class hungry become industrialists Industrialization fact pick War industrys share national output doubled But enough broadly transform agricultural society Modern industry employed 25 million people population 350 million

Amiya Kumar Bagchi Marxist economist suggests reason lack effective demand colonial period limited business opportunity Indians poor buy modern goods services24 If domestic Indian market small couldnt entrepreneur supplemented producing export Morris D Morris blames supply constraints25 An Indian entrepreneur uncompetitive shortage technology skilled labor capital—all raised cost production The historian Rajat Ray argues Indian businessmen export made inferior products unacceptable world market In view technological backwardness single biggest failing26 But surely could imported technology Jamshedji Tata GD Birla others did

Unlike nationalist historians I think British conspiracy deliberately underinvest India sabotage Indian business interests Bombays textile mills built credit technical assistance machines Britain although competitive threat Manchesters mills I believe industrial revolution occur Indian agriculture remained stagnant cannot industrial revolution without agricultural surplus means feed rapidly growing urban population second international trading environment turned hostile protectionism First World War followed Depression third colonial government educate masses unlike Japanese state finally colonial mindset pervaded Indian middle classeven hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence politically enslaved

What verdict British rule

Did British impoverish India There question 18th century plundered looted Indias wealth conquerors done history But create ongoing institutions Indias detriment This nature theory colonialism True Industrial Revolution threw millions weavers work would happened way new technology reached India British government policy could cushioned impact erecting trade barriers saved enormous amount human suffering protecting handlooms would temporary palliative

Odd may seem I believe Britain “exploit” India enough Had made massive investments India Americas India would become prosperous much bigger market British goods A richer India would better customer better supplier firmer basis Empire27 Britains main failure educate Indian masses—hence 83 percent Indians illiterate Independence Britains education system India produced thin upper crust extremely well educated Indians masses remained illiterate28

Although Britain could lift Indians poverty avert famines give India institutions democracythe rule law independent judiciary free press It built railways canals harbors It gave India almost hundred years peace—the Pax Britannica Although gave modern values institutions interfere ancient traditions religion Hence India preserved spiritual heritage old way life continues Many despair divisiveness caste hold Indian way life also bulwark onslaught global culture

Independence License Raj

After Independence democracy took root India gradually masses acquired stake system periodically electing representatives even lowest castes The rulers also adopted Fabian socialist economic path Indians turn capitalism 1991 although modest liberalization economy 1980s Thus India embraced democracy capitalism makes journey modernity unique explains good deal

Jawaharlal Nehru planners trust private entrepreneurs made state entrepreneur surprisingly failed create industrial revolution Instead India experienced agricultural revolution early 1970s It thus important precondition industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but industrial takeoff eluded Its investment rate also rose 6 percent well 20 per cent yet engender takeoff Why

I think least six things wrong Indias mantra one adopted inwardlooking importsubstituting path rather outwardlooking exportpromoting route thus denied share world trade prosperity trade brought postWar era Two set massive inefficient monopolistic public sector denied autonomy working hence investments productive poor capitaloutput ratio Three overregulated private enterprise worst controls world diminished competition market four discouraged foreign capital denied benefits technology world class competition Five pampered organized labor point extremely low productivity Six ignored education children

Nehrus strategic planner PC Mahalanobis made two wrong assumptions He assumed opportunities rapid export expansion 1950s turned wrong India discovered tiny Hong Kong could earn exports whole India Indias share world trade declined 22 percent 1947 05 percent 1990 He also assumed competition wasteful also flawed idea little improvement productivity without it

Even damaging creeping controls private sector The bizarre licensing system It began Industrial Licensing Act 1951 required entrepreneur get license set new unit expand change product mix A huge number untrained clerks engineers bureaucrats Directorate General Technical Development operating basis inadequate information vetted thousands applications ad hoc basis These low level functionaries took months futile microreview application finally sent approval administrative ministry The ministry lost months reviewing data sent application interministerial licensing committee After Ministers approval investor seek approval import machinery capital goods licensing committee If finance needed State financial institution scrutiny repeated afresh The result enormous delays sometimes lasting years staggering opportunities corruption

Large business houses set parallel bureaucracies Delhi follow files organize bribes win licenses If entrepreneur finally get started made success enterprise trouble It offence punishable law manufacture beyond capacity granted license India became country world production sorely needed goods sorely punishable law29

The system ended thwarting competition entrepreneurship growth without achieving social objectives It fostered monopolies proliferated uneconomicsize plants remote uncompetitive locations employing secondrate technology Bureaucrats clue basics running business made decisions choice technology size location plants

Although becoming clear India wrong path late sixties instead changing course Nehru Indira Gandhi introduced controls She nationalized banks discouraged foreign investment placed hurdles domestic enterprise Hence industrial growth plunged 77 per cent year 19511965 40 per cent 19661980 Productivity Indian manufacturing declined half percent year 1960 198530

“19661980 effectively dark period Indian economy”31 It harder blame Nehru adopting economic wrong model socialism wisdom age dozens economists visited India hailed bold experiment32 It right blame Indira Gandhi Japans miracle evident Korea Taiwan following footsteps However ideology one part story An important reason nonperformance poor implementation Even Nehrus socialism could delivered degenerate “License Raj”

India Reforms

Although modest liberalization 1980s decisive turning point came July 1991 minority government Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms It opened economy foreign investment trade dismantled import controls lowered customs duties devalued currency made rupee convertible trade account virtually abolished licensing controls private investment dropped tax rates broke public sector monopolies As result growth rose 75 percent year three years row midnineties inflation came 13 percent 6 percent 1993 exchange reserves shot 1 billion 20 billion 1993 crossed 100 billion end 2003 This important turning point Dengs revolution China December 1978 Surprisingly elected coalition governments succeeded Rao continued reform process despite slow incremental pace made India one fastest growing major economies world33

Indians traditionally accorded high place making money Hence merchant bania placed third fourcaste hierarchy behind brahmin kshatriya step ahead laboring shudra After economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable sons brahmins kshatriyas began get MBAs wanted become entrepreneurs The business pages newspapers became livelier chief ministers states scrambled private investment judges became evenhanded industrial disputes As result India midst social revolution rivalled perhaps ascent Japans merchant class 1968 Meiji Restoration

There also mental revolution And changed attitude English illustrates new mindset Ever since British left Indians constantly carped English language But 1990s carping seemed die quietly without ceremony English became one Indian languages English lost colonial stigma oddly enough around time Hindu nationalists came power Young Indians new middle class think English skill like Windows This Hinglish Hindi mixed English spreading Encouraged flourishing private television channels supported advertisers newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace uninhibited hybrid Hindi English popular idiom bazaar rushing socioeconomic ladder The purists naturally disapprove people comfortable accepting today Indians relaxed confident people Their minds become decolonized

The world meanwhile also changed industrial information economy seemed speak Indias advantage symbolized success software business process outsourcing These “Bangalores” given Indians confidence reflect new social contract The new entrepreneurs inherit wealth risen back talent hard work professional skills A new selfbelief emerged among urban youth doesnt need approval others especially West Music composers like AR Rehman display exuberant nonchalance new young Bollywood pop stars So new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy designers fashion clothes beauty queens cricket stars

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains great deal Indian economy stagnating first half 20th century went become one fastest growing end century It tells us example disgraceful protectionism governments interwar years first half 20th century dampened world trade slowed world Indian economies It also explains India performed world average 19501980 thinking trade impoverished colonial period India closed economy denied fruits “golden period” world trade 1950 1970 “License Raj” institutions Nehrus socialism also suppressed growth Finally neoclassical economics explains dismantling controls integrating economy global economy Indian economy become competitive growing rapidly reforms

But whole story must turn institutions attitudes understand incentive structure Indian society60 Indians blame colonialism impoverishing But seen colonialism complex tale For example deindustrialize India nationalists argued handloom textiles died India world technological obsolescence Colonialisms bigger damage loss Indian confidence inhibited Indian entrepreneurs This confidence began grow Gandhis freedom movement first half 20th century industrialization pick However impact society insufficient create industrial revolution

After Independence Indias confidence certainly rose democracy took root flawed economic institutions Nehruvian socialism acted damper Once socialist institutions began replaced capitalist ones Reform period selfassurance returned Indian marketplace Todays mood India opposite existed hundred years ago Insecurity inferiority filled colonial India apparent writings Bengali writers 19th century Bankim Chandra Chatterji Today writers like Salman Rushdie Arundhati Roy exhibit matter fact assuredness almost cool reflection changed national mindset

India embraced democracy first capitalism afterwards made difference India became fullfledged democracy 1950 universal suffrage extensive human rights 1991 opened free play market forces For rest world way around In West suffrage extended gradually last century mass political parties developed democracy began impinge capitalist institutions practices

Indias democracy overwhelming majority poor voters70 per cent still live rural areas organized labor constitutes less 10 per cent total labor middle class around 20 per cent population Because democratic pressures India tried redistribute pie baked It set intricate regulatory networks private economy transformed rural industrial society It began think terms “welfare” welfaregenerating jobs The result seen throttling enterprise slow growth missed opportunities It price India paid democracy capitalism—or rather much democracy enough capitalism

Since politics short run game growth long run one never situation completely optimal This explains Indian politicians bother education results take long time come When politician promises rice two rupees kilo costs five rupees market wins election Since mid1960s politicians vigorously competed giving away free goods services voters When politicians money come creating schools improving old ones Indias damaging fiscal deficit around 10 percent GDP center states combined testimonial downside competitive politics teaches demand publicly provided goods services insatiable democracy

But Indias problems governance go far beyond need appease interests The weakening democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi 1970s caused widespread corruption political violence populist giveaways paralysis problem solving Conspicuously absent disciplined party organizations help leaders democracies mobilize support specific programs Hence excessive reliance personal appeal individual leaders win elections When power leaders tend take easy way act all

Will capitalism cousin globalization succeed establishing comfortable place India The answer depends ability deliver prosperity broadly It also depends leaders government business champion classic liberal premises free trade competition It needs leaders come say 1 people fare well competitive market place 2 winners far outnumber losers 2 capitalist democracy best arrangement found 4 globalization good thing great leap forward history My fear capitalisms success India threatened much leftists protectionists timidity defenders

The curious historic inversion democracy capitalism means Indias path future evolving daily dialogue conservative forces caste religion village leftist Nehruvian socialist forces dominated intellectual life country 40 years new forces global capitalism These “million negotiations democracy” slow pace economic reforms also mean India might stable peaceful negotiated transition future say China It might also avoid deleterious side effects unprepared capitalist society Russia Although slower India likely preserve way life civilization diversity tolerance spirituality onslaught global culture

Does culture matter

Cultural explanations vigorous industry India hundred years Colonial officials routinely blamed Indias poverty otherworldly spirituality Hindu life fatalistic beliefs Max Weber attributed absence development caste system Gunnar Myrdal Swedish economist found Indias social system attitudes important cause “low level equilibrium” low productivity primitive production techniques low levels living34

Deepak Lal another economist similarly explained economic stagnation low level “Hindu equilibrium” around caste system bought stability context political warfare monsoon failure climatic uncertainty labor shortage undervalued merchant class35 David Landes historian blames enervating heat deleterious work For reason rich countries lie temperate zones poor tropics semitropics36

While institutions culture matter undoubtedly skeptical national stereotypes easy cultural explanations sort common hundred years ago In experience successful Hindu entrepreneurs extremely otherworldly religion aggressive business The Indian farmer despite caught caste system responds quickly market based incentives Green Revolution testifies Brahmins supposed contempt manual labor plough land vigorously And Rajput Thakurs never worked living shed feudal ways sake commercial opportunity Moreover substantial nonHindus India communities also stuck rut stagnation Other Asian countries equally backward “Hindu equilibrium” explain away stagnation Finally Indians migrate countries perform better

Thus I uncomfortable “otherworldly values Hindus” “immobilizing effects caste system” “conservative habits merchant caste” I believe Sir John Hicks Economic Principle trump cases It states “people would act economically opportunity advantage presented would take it”37 It explains diffusion Green Revolution across India also demographic transitions currently underway many states

When seeking explanation nations wealth poverty preferred method begin economic factors proximate causes motivate businessman investthe size market capability suppliers distribution hurdles state competition If satisfy I seek answers institutions course intimately tied culture I found institutions evolve rapidly incentives change society transferred fairly quickly example 1990s India able dismantle many institutions Nehruvian socialism replace capitalist institutions Finally none factors provide satisfactory explanation I turn attitudes social structure

I find Deepak Lalls distinction material cosmological beliefs useful38The material beliefs civilization ways making living subject economics cosmological ones live realm culture The rise west accompanied change sets beliefs East Asias success needed mainly change material beliefs—it become prosperous without losing soul In words possible modernize without westernizing Ever since British Raj material beliefs changing India unlike cosmological beliefs

Our continuing inability distinguish “modern” “western” India surely cause grief If could accept great deal modern western culture especially material beliefs Wests property universal critical way thinking belongs rational human beings We would waste energies swadeshi protectionism hindutva preserving ancient Hindu civilization futile language debates “remove English primary schools” The debate modernisation westernisation begun early nineteenth century Ram Mohan Roy continues rage India At root fear loss Indian way life The older generation fears young whose minds decolonised confident adopting Wests material beliefs without fearing loss cosmological ones

I think step right direction However lot scope improvement I couple points add Please correct I’m wrong share valuable insights Also comprehensive study articlespapers welcome


 For starters rates quite confusing I spoke CA guy thinks lot confusion So I think say beta phase After implementation govt would need sort various issues make sure increases efficiency Also I think rates various items decided haste randomly So addressed implementation


 I think doesn’t solve central issue Police state borders make excuses stop trucks demand bribes One relatives truck transporter If driver doesn’t pay bribe police simply break headlights charge fine This lot common In respect GST barely helps faster movements goods Since petroleum Alcohol kept GST police stop trucks check items

 It’s far one tax one nation The proposed tax structure includes Central GST State GST Interstate GST “Given current structure person business three States get six registrations make number regulatory filings

 The Central GST Bill allows central government set antiprofiteering authority law designate existing authority carry functions  The authority responsible ensuring reduction tax rates account implementation GST results commensurate reduction prices  India bad experience new monitoring bodies I afraid simply turn another method officials stronghand honest business extort money proper oversight antiprofiteering body CVC railway established catch corrupt officials It yet catch single official know much corruption This lead govt govt means corruption inefficiency

 I think take atleast 23 years clarity rates various legal issues Till would chaos inflation generally increase After govt make right iterations might see benefit GST

 Lastly In India reforms generally work different way Govt takes 3 steps ahead much brouhaha takes two steps back So left one step right direction better zero steps ahead

 I going write truth unfair evaluationthere things u must know
 
 1 GGSIPU pays Rs 25 per answer book one bundle 30 answer books makes Rs750  evaluating one bundleGGSIPU norms say evaluator must take 3 hours evaluate one bundleso day evaluator evaluate maximum two bundleswhich makes total earning Rs1500 per day  conveance Rs600 per day making total amount  Rs 2100
 Now actually happens university two evaluation centres one first third year second final yearnow actually happens isan evaluator reaches centre A 930 get bundle issued heshe checks one hour deposit university employees take back three hoursso leave bundle rush B centre get another bundle issued 1100  check 1200 rush back centre A return previous bundle get new bundle issued therethe process repeated evaluator ends checking two bundles evaluation centres thus earning Rs 4200 day instead Rs 2100  day
 imagine answer book u wrote 3 hours evaluated less 2 minutescoz evaluator right marks front sheet total also fill additional evaluation sheet marksand maximum 1 half hour 30 answer books This done around 20  evaluators comes evaluation
 
 2 To evaluator university ask every evaluator fill form contains maximum four subject evaluator taught current semesterthis form need signed hod head institution alsonow beauty teachers teaches two subject college forms evaluators fill four subjectsnow imagine four subject centre A four subject centre B mean know 8 subjects thus makes elligible check copies 8 different subjectscoz one subject answer books get next subject issued
 
 3 Approx 80  evaluators prepare solution know solutionthey giving average marksthat reason students writing anything get marks often pass exams
 
 4 Most senior sincere teachers go evaluationthe people evaluation primarily consolidated salary getting anything Rs20000 Rs 30000 salary parent collegeso find opportunity earn extra moneyjust imagine evaluators earn around Rs 50000 even evaluationthis explain reasons
 
 5 The fact evaluators actually evaluate answer books90 evaluation done monitary benefits associated itso university takes serious counter measures continue happen

Non-Political,Hinduism conversion neutrality Indian Secular State nonpolitical theological exploration,1,2qlsrb,He-Hell,9,"tldr

 Pagan traditions Semitic religions fundamentally different manifestations religiosity 

  Traditions difficult proselytize consider traditions false 

 Semitic religions believe religions indeed false encourage facilitate conversion 

 The Indian state sees Hinduism another semitic religion 

 The Indian state allowing conversion working within Christian theological framework It neutral  



Full length

In India two different kinds religions Pagan Dharmic Indic traditions Hindu Jain Buddhist traditions Semitic Abrahamic religions Islam Christianity 

Hindu traditions exist passed one generation Such traditions actively seek converts entertain notion people follow false gods false religions 

Such traditions see things like devas puja pr bhakti familial traditional practices They followed order maintain continuity different generations contain grand timeless truth The practioners traditions might try justify actions Durga bhakt would say worshiped killed powerful demon  Such justifications mostly offered outsiders nonbhakts nonhindus theologically consistent 

Observing ancestral practices need justified logically nothing logical writing sonnet using 14 lines Why 14 Its tradition There nothing scientific logical 

 Semitic religions namely Islam Christianity spread partly ancestral practices partly conversion

 Islamic Christian theologians try always successfully course logically consistent  think grand timeless truth Using Godgiven faculty Reason want understand nature Creation Creator Conversion makes sense Muslims Christians think false religions false gods And people worship false gods punished die True God To save “heathen” Muslims Christians encouraged engage proselytization conversion 

The heathen needs saved spiritual blindness
 

Indian secularism defined equal respect equidistance religions The secular state sees Hinduism another Semitic religion internally consistent theology containing singular grand Truth So Brahmin another kind Priest Gita another kind “religious” text like Quran Having confused tradition religion Indian state allows proselytization thinking possible convert people one tradition 


By allowing proselytization conversion Indian state accepted that

1	There True gods False  gods
2	It possible necessary understandable people “saved” eternal damnation worshiping false gods 
3	Hindu traditions compete financially theologically “marketplace damned souls” level footing Islam Christianity
  
None statements holds  neutral scientific scrutiny  Do humans souls Can souls damned Are True False gods Do Islam Christianity contain timeless truth 

Within framework Hindu “theology” notions false gods punished worshiping goads make sense

However statements make sense within framework Christian theology 

Faced two completely contradictory theoretical positions false gods false gods Indian state cannot neutral It either allows conversion done past 60yrs accepts semitic notion false gods heathens etc bans conversion gives undue advantage pagan traditions 

Faced two different kinds religions Indian state cannot afford equidistant show equal respect

However fate last week elder brother passed away Obviously entire family shook still recovering During rites sure mother elders paranoia kicked mothers majority edlers wish drop education support elderly mother starting work unskilled labor He however allowed pursue open degree degree local college continuing work I still count silver lining The family also debt according thinking cannot afford remaining son pursuing degree 4 years time

Absolutely preposterous move isnt unprecendented families low income little education Since hard times I refrain bashing

As I see two options First persuade mother let continue studies IIIT future better A educated kin advised mother I told advice fell deaf ears understandably His classes starting week given brother passed away days ago timing really bad Plus leaving mother alone time also sounds horrible 

The second option give mothers wishes stay home go work pursue study part time I talked student phone He confused torn like I said keen studying also wants mother hard times His mother family insisting go work isnt really helping Given almost end July colleges finished admissions worried wasting year 

In IIIT chose Electronics major keen pursuing career technology I vouch ambitious puts required work It would shame talentpotential goes waste due harrowing situation found   I try best pursues first option however reality reality needs prepared worst Given work 48 hours week rest time pursue degree options terms universitiescolleges still open admission let pursue degree part timethe closer sciencetech better Are programs undergraduation What options

Science/Technology,NPEngineering Education In India Hot Intake Cold Results,46,4gbzmf,hganjoo,18,"Under new NDA government rush establish glut premier technical institutions A proposal six new IITs ratified addition nine new ones already established 2008 The total number candidates JEE Mains 125 lakhs year The All India Council Technical Education recognizes whopping 6378 institutions undergraduate engineering study humongous intake 3178 lakh The AllIndia Survey Higher Education AISHE report year 201314 pegs proportion undergraduate enrolment engineering technology computer fields combined 2008 second combined field Arts Humanities Social Sciences

However quantity mean quality Does offering longreaching career choices students old enough vote drink parents sync current market research scenario fare well context Indian higher education

Indicators Concern

Employability

The National Employability Report published Aspiring Minds 2015 presents worrying numbers paint sorry picture It found meagre 1791 engineers employable software services sector abysmal 367 software products sector In nonIT roles statistics alarming 65 555 engineers employable design roles electrical mechanical engineering respectively 

The report comments candidates lack basic programming algorithmic knowledge nonIT core roles lack clear grasp fundamentals often thing required recruiters In fact says 60 engineers lag behind possessing specific domain knowledge 

The goto option burgeoning class aspirers engineering represents “easy path” focus end results eclipses learning processes Moreover choices specialization made based entrance examination ranks taste specialised curricula actual field work particular subject Such illinformed decisionmaking bound generate outpouring reluctant engineers confused illequipped respective areas 

Output

The important outcome technical education research development Contributing advancing technology terms academic research patents important development indicator RD output direct effects economic prosperity standard living 

The SCImago Journal  Country Rank rates publications countries terms research output different fields Ranking countries citationsperdocument published indicates average number times paper cited works find India ranked middling 40th among 87 nations least 1000 engineering publications 1996 2014 

According data collected Organisation Economic Cooperation Development OECD selected indicators innovation among labs higher educational institutions 2014 find India comes 31st 48 ranked entities terms patents filed per GDP percentage including combined number EU comes India 

We see India languishes middle terms patents citation counts academic publications What forces afoot drag India’s comparative performance mediocrity despite colossal undergraduate intake Let’s crunch numbers get bottom it

A Chain Causes

Postgraduate Education

Research output also measures health postgraduate doctoral education countries signalling willingness undergraduates continue field choosing A report published 2013 South Asia Development Sector World Bank says 9456 engineering students India undergraduates 54 Master’s programs lowest Brazil 

At time 2014 report published Student Exchange Visitor Program SEVP United States says huge majority 81 Indiabased graduate students STEM fields 

This data points prevalent scenario limited information social pressure compels undergraduates pick engineering higher education machinery fails retain numbers postgraduate levels least India  Students afford fly abroad especially US search better options education employment 
The AISHE 201314 report also says 9 respondents enrolled postgraduate courses went pursue PhD field links us next issue 

Throttled Funds

The dearth doctoral students engineering fields owes small part inadequate compensation Junior research fellows take home Rs 25000 per month senior PhD candidates get Rs 28000 Moreover insufficient funds allocated science engineering research making production high quality matter challenging 
International Science Engineering Indicators published National Science Foundation USA include proportion GDP expended RD based India ranks 40th among 60 nations studied lowly 081
 

Teacher Numbers

Above saw small percentage students transition postgraduate doctoral studies fields extension number qualified teachers college level falls denting prospects proper education subsequent generations students creating vicious loop negative feedback 

Two statistics comparisons mentioned World Bank report signal severe shortage teaching resources engineering education arena

Using general higher education statistics MHRD reports 2011 report estimates average faculty per institution 19 studenttofaculty ratio 24 The latter ratio depicts even spreading teaching resources high value means lesser attention every individual student’s learning objectives To put number perspective AICTE recommends ratio 12 undergraduate level 15 graduate level 

With betterpaying avenues regular jobs fresh graduates stay away lengthy arduous path academia teaching

Conclusions

The lack postgraduates doctoral researchers best teachers prevents blossoming rewarding academic atmosphere thus makes departments accumulate reluctant untrained teachers making unattractive best talents  This stunts exposure good teaching research undergraduates turn contributes disillusionment insufficient interest technical knowledge low employability rates departure technical fields work study post first degree feeding crippling dearth skills results higher levels

I understand new govt comes power appoints people govt offices When UPA came power 2004 replaced state governers sympathizers Now BJP come power thing except Mr Najib Jung Fair enough pretty much consistent

But one thing I dont get BJP appointing unqualified people institutions national importance How serve purpose Isnt philosophy Make In India If want India develop need qualified guardians institutions national importance

I understand India academia highly influences leftist ideology I personally despise Im libertarian  procapitalism comes economic ideology 

BJP Far Right Wing procapitalism economic philosophy core But recent appointments justify If right wing market capitalism BJP give autonomy institutions instead screwing reputation highhanded appointments

I understand top brass BJPRSS feel curricula Indian education system Indian culturetraditions They also feel history subject biased But want change shouldnt school level 

Anyway institutions like IITTIFRIISScIIMs mostly science technology  technology So messing them

India already doesnt Univ top 300 ranking QS world ranking With recent highhanded appointments Im sure quality take nosedive

Science/Technology,An Exposition Solution NGO problem,1,28fy7b,nerds_revenge,1,"Disclaimer I author This excellent essay written RudradevBRF  

NGOs nonprofit organizations whose ostensible role fill gaps social service education community services sanitation health conservation natural resources etc government either resourcepoor overburdened fill India mandated fill reasons smallgovernment conservative political philosophy many developed Western countries

There many organizations would fit todays definition NGO fact done lot good India Amul farmers cooperative Gujarat transformed dairy industry Baba Amtes organization helped leprosy patients suffered unjust marginalization ostracism rural Maharashtra The Chipko movement spearheaded tribals preserve forest resources The IDRF RSS forefront many disaster relief missions As long movements indigenous draw support local volunteers function coherence deepstate interests able contribute important desirable services kinds

The problem course arises foreign resources used support NGOs working India I couple stories illustrate means new problem India suggest potential solution problem filling gaps services given foreignfunded NGOs way system

The first case involves close relative mine As newlyminted engineer early 1950s came Bombay join Government India concern The concern time inducting new technology American help part USAID program An American sent train Indian engineers use new technology part foreign assistance package This common arrangement first decade independence GOIs mission statement emphasized advancements science technology industry

This American spent early years Dehra Dun passable job speaking Hindi He genuine expert field employed fulltime major US corporation trained young Indian engineers well He would also sit office hours late night typing messages telex machine The Indian engineers including relative would sometimes wonder jasoosi kar raha hai kya On one occasion one Indians brought matter IAS officer charge concern His reply Is teaching well Then learn Why worried otherwise

And indeed learning lot American young men Indian traditional values respected guru fact many went successful illustrious careers benefit knowledge So let go

It wasnt 20 years later relative discovered chance newspaper clipping old American trainer receiving medal US President Gerald Ford It turned American OSS man served distinction Burma Second World War deputation CIA many countries since including India

The point story sort thing going long time ever since India became independent Foreign assistance came India GOIs request help fill gaps governance advanced training GOI equipped plug Often assistance package came strings attached manned foreign intelligence agents example More surprisingly GOI KNEW accepted probably monitored foreign agents activities tried ensure didnt get eyes anything sensitive interest greater good GOI policy determined better CIA guy training Indians new technology training Thats priorities shook out

One almost understand appetite sort arrangements new desperately poor nation willing pay high price improve future prospects However know Indias prospects improve substantially following decades Corrupt selfserving regimes led successive Dynasty potentates showed little interest building selfsufficiency plugging gaps governance indeed providing governance Thus deemed necessary evil 1950s fade obsolescence 1960s 1980s 2000s instead transformed extremely powerful wellestablished institution right The industry foreign funded NGOs came dominate every aspect social judicial economic environmental activism across length breadth India Over decades usurped mandates extending far beyond originally stated purpose supplementing government services All course never held commitment upholding interests Indian deep state

The NGO monster reached pinnacle strength Sonia Gandhis regime last decade finding ultimate embodiment National Advisory Council parallel nationallevel policymaking apparatus indebted manner foreign interests supplement elected Government India utterly sidelined In meantime every constitutionallymandated institution Indian deep state financial internal security armed forces judicial systematically undermined eroded This fact IB warning us urgent need roll back

So second story suggests possible solution problem There persistent lacunae social environmental services GOI yet fill India know Its also true GOI vast roster priority issues fix macrolevel however indefatigable Mr Modi might might well never get around taking lacunae How ensure filled agents sterling sense commitment Indian deep state

The second story involves gentleman named Mike neighbour NYC I met 84 died five years later

Mike firstgeneration Italian American immigrant grew supporting eight siblings small town upstate New York Great Depression This doublewhammy Italians racially discriminated WASP majority economic circumstances time engendered sort starvationlevel poverty near absence hope terms access education employment US known since second world war ended

The solution came Franklin Delano Roosevelt US President Mike revered almost greater human Apart sweeping series macrolevel fiscal reforms Roosevelt introduced volunteer initiative called Civilian Conservation Corps As part New Deal CCC provided unskilled manual labour jobs related conservation natural resources governmentowned lands creating employment deprived also implementing general natural resource conservation program every state territory

Over 3 million young Americans participated CCC provided food shelter clothing well small stipend however something far important It provided population brink despair sense commitment motivation serve community nation public responsibility It restored dignity generation would otherwise reduced begging streets In case Mike many lakhs ItalianAmericans brought invaluable infusion nationalist spirit brought margins society mainstream Learning skills went along conducting minor maintenance public utilities helping keep streets parks clean sanitary Mike eventually joined US Navy fought Pacific Diesel Mechanic LST The GI bill also Roosevelt initiative gave Mike opportunity get automobile engineering degree afterwards transforming life family beyond recognition

What could wasted life social marginalization economic victimhood transformed asset nation every way As one consequence Italian immigrants signed fight US Second World War total strength Mussolinis forces

A similar initiative CCC taken NSDAP Germany around time creation Arbeitsdienst It derided fascist dominant Western narrative today contributed great deal spirit millions young men grew crushing deprivation Weimar Germany found willing sacrifice everything Reich

Can begin imagine time marginalized sections society arent deliberately kept marginalized benefit NGOs profit ongoing despair Where service left undone GOI isnt left foreign agents regard national interest indeed transforms generation Indians act rendering work foremost proponents national interest future",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/28fy7b/an_exposition_and_solution_to_the_ngo_problem/

Science/Technology,Serious Post Bye,380,f161mw,Snoopyrun,124,"Its time I dont see relevance trying go drudgery I beg patience part go post

At 30 years age set path career I utterly useless I cant even provide let alone take care others

I 30yearold socalled general category lowerclass family man Haha pathetic isnt it

x200B

I good student till Xth slow downhill started scores Struggling pass 12th state medium 70 pass 50 mathematics

x200B

Then coming lowerclass family enough choices go  either Medical ENgineering I prepared Medical taking 1year gap Nothing substantial came In end I go engineering Because sadly country gap years strict nono stakeholders I could waste 1 year

x200B

Did BTechhttpsBTech engineering Applied Electronics  Instrumentation one good private colleges Bhubneswar Odisha Yes Odisha  might guessed economic conditions Passed Average CGPA 71

x200B

No jobs came engineering field At last I recruited service company name starts I go   This 6 years back

Why

Because alternate way I sole breadearner family My dad retired job

Trained Mysore  I programming background I found really hard go training especially advanced chapters I take retest final exam since I failed first one In retest I literally take help kind souls took pity shared answers I passed retest minimum pass marks

GOt posted Mangalore Here literally opposite side India I cam  I felt alone Loneliness became best friend I avoided getting projects   support development Because I knew heart I could it

After gap almost 1 year I forced managers support project In team seeing utterly bad skills put 1st level support person  triage one  someone acts first point contact customers records issues creates incidents tickets passes onto teammates Literally 1 year

Then slowly put application support SQL work along niche technology called TM1

Being absolutely weak technologies let alone niche technologies  could really improve upon situation   Thus kept bare minimum work state one frankly I could doa anything else

I remained project 45 years took transfer Bhubaneswar Here I avoided getting projects 1 year forcibly put support project Informatica Unix TM1 Cognos used I one present

HEre well seeing lack skills I put bare minimum level My lead literally scolded many times I become numb

Below excuses points validate inactions  plain naked truths

NOw hell I would asked 

what I it

What I learn new skills

What I even get another job

The answer nothing NOthing  Why

because I listless

I lack memory right retain anything I keep forgetting common things points let aline study become proficient programming language

I lack logical reasoning person learn actually code

I lack mathematical skills

Now would believe I told I scored 100100 Xth Computer Science exam  consisting OOPS Blue Java

But I know utter waste  worth 2 paise India hypercompetitive world

x200B

Since 6 years I remained severely depressed OCD patterns coming well My memory faded My enthusiasm gone anything Nihilism mind I tried come  I saying lightly I tried take away mind dwelling things escape multiple options person get enjoyment  songs podcasts movies etc But nothing works I feel existential dread I done life deserve moment happiness says going movie hearing podcasts Guilttripping finest

Sometimes middle day I see something think something I break Tears tears even bright day At night tears friend

You might think friends family help The answer I really friends call 2 speak sorrow get shoulder cry on

My family well  high hopes My dad mum put everything get good education I state They slowly coming conclusion I utter failure

My lifeline shredded inactions lack skills lack intent improve situation And much time passed And I honestly dont see point it

Sometimes I wish loved ones mind I cease exist  memory mine faded instant  go pain would feel I take away life

What sorry pathetic selfish piece shit stain I You thinking arent Yes I I much more

But literally way go I see career paths I good anything I lack memory I lack interest field proficient in

All doors shut now

Today walking road I suddenly wished would happen I walk right front ofo trucks passing by

At least people would spared seeing utter wastrel I become fall further

Thus I prepared everything end swiftly  I put nominations mothers name 1 account I I everything would need one email  waiting drafts sent

I written goodbyes prayed  please forget ever son To erase memories I written farewell loved ones

Now thank dear readers going post You empathy I pray grow heart

There problems way govern country today political parties today entrenched histories dynasties Hindutva regionalism casteism communism crony capitalism et cetera able find solutions India needs move forward

Indian humanist Party IhP facebook page finding solutions We yet political party may years even decades reach critical mass We see IhP forerunner political party one day govern India humanist principles build happy prosperous clean green united safe country

The principles humanism include primacy fundamental human rights using evidencebased rationality make policy decisions

This atheist organization The word humanist used refer secular humanism commitment interpretations religious texts ideologies lead conclusion violating fundamental human rights justified considered unacceptable

We believe people freedom belief freedom belief government political parties involved propagating inhibiting religion That role believe best left individuals communities The two principles humanism applied actions party are

1 The primacy fundamental human rights
2 Using evidencebased rationality empathy foundation decision making

Its time India move Hindutva inspired vision humanist inspired one

This 50year project

The RSS started nearly century ago 1925 community volunteers create Hindu rashtra alternative Congress vision secular India In 1984 BJP Hindutva inspired party two seats last 35 years replaced Congress dominant force country’s politics

Our goal learn replicate successes RSS BJP enjoyed help India transition Hindutva inspired vision humanist inspired one one believe feel effective achieving goals The goal actualize original vision Congress 1947 build inclusive secular progressive modern nation learn mistakes one possibly focus group identities rather treating voters individuals We believe led communal voting blocks polarization inevitable emergence majorityminority narrative unhelpful frame almost political conversations today

Metrics driven

We set communicate measure progress tangible measurable goals They include rankings internationally recognized reports

1 World Happiness Report current ranking 122145
2 Human development index current ranking 130189
3 GDP per capita current ranking 120181 per World Bank
4 Education index current ranking 112188
5 Life expectancy current ranking 125183
6 Corruption perceptions index current ranking 78180
7 Global peace index current ranking 136163
8 Press freedom index current ranking 140180
9 Gini coefficient inequality current ranking 99158 per World Bank
10 Gender equality report 87144

We find ways ensure state local equivalents metrics defined monitored measure objective performance PMs CMs local officials find way ensure thirdparty audit numbers gives assurance public transparent honest progress lack progress made fronts We never knowingly present factually incorrect data public

We agnostic respect economic ideology

Capitalism created wealth prosperity many nations general rule would like move liberalized economy believe improve quality citizens country compared government controlled environment However unchecked capitalism create perpetual inequalities society extremely damaging effect environment pollution levels ultimately health life expectancy And therefore believe must state support vulnerable members society state protection environment We make case case decisions therefore based discussion debates pros specific economic policies In cases use data expert advice make decisions best balance competing demands economic growth reducing poverty inequality protecting environment

We committed internal democracy

As party regular elections determine lead party every 5 years There term limits 10 years respect leadership However change manifesto would use 23rds majority 75 quorum party members

National security

We work towards peacefully agreeing internationally recognized borders neighbors  China Pakistan Bangladesh This could bilaterally help external bodies United Nations The final decision unlikely one make everyone happy sides border many lives lost countries want find productive ways engaging neighbors We cross border invade land attack people We improve intelligence defense capabilities order make lack strategic options decision would entail We use torture indefinite imprisonment instrument state policy We continue treat Kashmir integral part India don’t believe plebiscite politically feasible stance party hold India wants get elected Our goal normalize situation respect safety economic growth people Kashmir trust Indian government enough voluntarily vote Section 370 benefit greater integration rest India

Caste reservations

We absolutely stand caste discrimination time believe reservations solution caste discrimination The vast majority jobs informal private sectors reservations don’t apply The government accounts 34 jobs But result controversy percentage jobseducational places reserved entire brand politics emerged focuses reservations cemented caste identities place indefinitely perhaps eternity This led zerosum castebased electoral politics distract issues clean drinking water jobs law order etc And people suffer opinion vulnerable individuals associated lower castes

Over 70 years independence Dalits perhaps among poorest 200 million people world We believe solution caste problem world class primary education When penniless immigrants enter Scandinavian countries children get free education high quality within generation able live lives dignity possibility This along stringent focus ensuring violence individual promptly acted believe sustainable effective solution legacy caste system We also recognize yet politically viable solution many Dalits understandably feel something taken away people community assumption caste prejudices fade away persuasive evidence

Our approach would therefore leave reservations currently exist untouched We would instead focus energy investing education law order till trust levels built among Dalits etc viability pathway buying proposal disbanding reservations system way ending caste system all

Freedom speech standard discourse

We believe freedom speech foundation healthy democracies We work improve Press Freedom Index 140180 We never use jail legal means certainly violence curb individual body criticisms work get elected Even making factually incorrect statements deliberately lying We unscripted unmoderated press conferences major newspapers channels least month subject policies decisions full frank inquiry We restrictions freedom speech exception credible incitement violence deliberate lies defame private individuals businesses

Individuals businesses net assets Rs 1000 crores liable protect defamation except individuals also threshold This prevent rich individuals businesses use expensive lawyers stifle criticism practices common people We believe insulated effects malicious rumors benefit talking corporate industrial corruption openly disproportionate benefit society We work removal blasphemy laws laws seditious antinational speech We believe gods exist country run fairly strong enough withstand criticism We never brand anybody disagrees us antinational assume different idea best people country share views matter

Science business

We make concerted attempt place forefront technological advancements world profit worldclass businesses We want India place contribute technologically superior products like Apple Samsung Nokia Sony We want India place Nobel Prize winners Sciences come We’re fed developing nation We want contributing nation

Science/Technology,PSA A Guide Jobs field Computer Science Engineering Students prefinal  final year,292,bggn06,FanneyKhan,52,"  

Statutory Warning I work lot students final prefinal year engineering interview experiences I’ve gathered personal experience While making thread I consulted multiple people work product based service based startup companies know work experience pay scale I’ve also used LinkedIn salary Glassdoor Salary  reviews support words I willing modify anything think wrong

I see lot threads every week asking job scene India get I try put everything I know post 

Companies 

I classify companies 3 types

1 Product Based
2 Service Based
3 Startups

 Product Based Companies

What they

These companies make products sell software integration Most “apps” see examples product based companies Generally believed product based company engineer aim get working making product using product cases You directly involved developing testing product company made chances exposed best technologies greater

What need

Usually product based firm training job Nobody going hold hand tell The training bunch online videos MOOC documentations supposed read figure Since job profile going like expect someone code You strong hold least one programming language companies also demand good ObjectOriented Programming skills

Selection Process

Most good companies hire campuses good colleges There online platform like Hackerrankhttpswwwhackerrankcom given 2 3 questions The first question going easy question test write code The 2nd 3rd question aim test CS concepts mainly Algorithms The 2nd question medium difficulty usually brute force way solve optimized way Coding brute force method get half marks complex test cases timeout The 3rd question usually meant test knowledge implementing algorithms problemsolving skills

Some companies like Uber CodeNation etc hire platforms like InterviewBithttpswwwinterviewbitcom really look college come But always clause minimum 60 academic score product based companies Some companies take stretch even cutoff 10th 12th marks

Linkedin jobs Glassdoor jobs also good place look response portals little slow India

Interview Experience

Once clear coding round shortlisted interview In interview given problem The problem CS problem algorithms Data Structures design problem You given time think don’t usually expect code solution computer You write pseudo code MUST always share thinking

Some interviewers going give vague question expect ask questions clarity No question stupid question Each interview lasts anywhere 10 minutes 40 minutes Nobody expecting complete correct verifiable solution cannot give totally wrong solutions

You might additionally quizzed resume They might ask indepth questions every project written ask justify need project chose technologies learn difficulties faced etc Sometimes might even ask questions related technologies mentioned resume

You might anywhere 1 6 rounds HR round

Some companies use rounds filter candidates ie certain number candidates go one round companies give score every round decide end So stay calm don’t overconfident you’re clearing rounds

How I prepare this

If you’re college focus class Subjects like Algorithms Data Structures qualifiers get interview Once inside quizzed Algorithms 8085 remaining 1520 asked DBMS  Computer Networks depending companies

If focus subjects get onto platforms like InterviewBithttpswwwinterviewbitcom  HackerRankhttpswwwhackerrankcom HackerEarthhttpswwwhackerearthcom start solving If solve significant chunk questions start solving questions CodeChefhttpswwwcodechefcom LeetCodehttpsleetcodecom  rdailyprogrammer You also take MITs course Design Analysis Algorithm herehttpsocwmiteducourseselectricalengineeringandcomputerscience6046jdesignandanalysisofalgorithmsspring2015 Some favorite questions Dynamic Programming Trees Hashing Graphs

Salary  Benefits

You can’t put cap salary product based firm You get anywhere 6LPA 12LPA base salary It depends companies Check GlassDoor reviews know company see interests align company’s interest Have look official websites know products research go attend interview 

 Service Based Companies

What they

They’re companies use products available market provide service client Some service based companies developed products also money companies comes providing service customer Ex  Cognizant TCS etc

What need

These companies looking someone wear multiple hats When interviewing fresher service based companies likely hired umbrella role “Associate” “Engineer” You might get development testing support Support isn’t kind work call center primarily engineering job either The pay less role fun depending much put work You wide array options come career nobody expect lot At least like product based companies 

Selection Process

Call interviews usually walkin interviews aptitude test You search websites carter jobs freshers TimesJobshttpswwwtimesjobscom FirstNaukrihttpswwwfirstnaukricom etc You looking openforall kind test TCS annual hiring tests follow TCS know dates Infosys hiring opentoall aptitude tests You also find information Careers section companies Some smaller companies offer walkin interviews found job fairs

Tests like AMCAThttpswwwmyamcatcom also help get interview calls AMCAThttpswwwmyamcatcom tests basic arithmetic aptitude English comprehension skills logic reasoning skills etc You get score wait companies call interview AMCAThttpswwwmyamcatcom 

There also “coaching” institutes teach basic programming offer 100 job guarantee Most time jobs service based companies The coaching fees anywhere 10k 25k 

Do research pay service don’t take word it

A good entry point reference If know someone working company get referral get interview This much valid great percentage hiring happens referrals also Many service based companies leverage attitude skills Some exploit desperation get lower pay

Interview Experience

There isn’t standard practice interviews service based company It basically depends interviewer I know people asked lot theory questions based field engineering even though company nothing field But I also know people asked HRround questions like “Why want join company” “How would tackle X scenario” 

So pray favorite Gods Goddesses go interview Read interview experiences company Glassdoorhttpswwwglassdoorcoinindexhtm GeeksForGeekshttpswwwgeeksforgeeksorgcategoryinterviewexperiences get rough idea kind questions might ask Don’t nervous

How prepare

Basic aptitude sometimes basic coding companies look Basic coding means able understand forwhileifelse ifelse constructs maybe write code sort array Refer IndiaBixhttpsindiabixcom aptitude take programming language tutorial Hackerrankhttpswwwhackerrankcom You’re better Chttpswwwhackerrankcomdomainscpp Javahttpswwwhackerrankcomdomainsjava find difficult start Pythonhttpswwwhackerrankcomdomainspython But eventually move ChttpswwwhackerrankcomdomainscppJavahttpswwwhackerrankcomdomainsjava one Aim getting 3 4 stars Hackerrankhttpswwwhackerrankcom

Salary  Benefits

Salary range 3 lpa 6lpa depending company interview There scope coming job also scope getting frustrated job Your job MIGHT something simple forwarding tickets something complex like fixing code managing service fault But get field dedication work patience It easier climb management service based company product based company While easier isn’t necessarily faster It’s slow process take time So lack patience looking specific field work like development job isn’t you

Its relatively relaxing fish ocean expectation upper management isn’t high You’ve standard benefits like insurance variable pay  bonus cab facility etc But don’t expect pampered P

 Startups

What they

These usually small new companies prototype stage They’ve got service market They’re MOSTLY productbased company They’re new they’re young they’re making lot money currently promise something big future

What need

Young talented people work without lot handholding It helps you’ve worked technologies looking A lot companies use opensource tech something need go classes trained Obviously must able take lot responsibility write good quality code mentor looking every line code

You given lot independence lot responsibility too

Selection process

If startup coming oncampus they’re going go product company way kick Hackerrankhttpswwwhackerrankcom tests There single way startup hires Sometimes able get calling asking internship emailing HR contacting HR LinkedIn In smaller companies even get touch founders via LinkedIn ask opportunity

A lot startups AngelListhttpsangelco starting point I think right add startups innovative Some “startups” aren’t really centers innovation money making Today open coaching class train students technology get away calling startup So research company If new company people isn’t usually great company start unless really interested working product have

You also keep look Internship Fairs A lot HR teams attend fairs hire graduates  students

Interview Experience

Your interview experience mostly likely similar product company interview strict There mixture skill attitude considered But complete noob don’t expect hired startup can’t afford train fully You need experience field CS Be data science application development web development machine learning This demonstrate ability learn independently

How Prepare

Handson Handson Handson Grab field interested go solving small problems The problems solve small writing script automatically book tickets latest Avengers movie complex creating robot extinguish fire autonomously 

Get good get out

Salary Benefits

The salary isn’t standard It depends old company much funding many employees So can’t put range It low service based company pays higher product based company pays

The work environment give lot independence The offices employeefriendly someone monitoring like watchman 24x7 strict policies you’ve adhere Your manager higher management approachable ever need discuss something

But time responsibilities I reiterating kind independence get bad thing used handholding This handholding done every step school college India either teachers parents peers That might necessarily case startups

I writing Skill development freelancing switching jobs etc  Stay tuned let know thought D",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bggn06/psa_a_guide_to_jobs_in_the_field_of_computer/

 Tldr

The DNA Bill back The DNA Bill aims regulate use outputs DNA technology certain cases subject many debate It introduced July 2019 Lok Sabha lapsed 2018 It referred Parliamentary Standing Committee Science Technology Environment Forests Climate Change October 18  The Committee invited comments Bill till November 18 oh lot comments

 Whats about

India attempting introduce legislation regulates DNA technology since early 2000s thankfully largely unsuccessful recently making fears quite real The current DNA Technology Use Application Regulation Bill 2019 seen number redrafts bringing present form yet continues problematic

Were grateful able voice concerns Parliamentary Standing Committee Science Technology Environment Forests Climate Change invited comments Bill referred Unfortunately submissions made cannot fully public prior Committee publishing report highlight major concerns give understanding think DNA Bill needs undergo work also needs introduced solid data protection law place

 A many concerns

 No data protection legislative framework With overarching data protection legislation India lack obligation within Bill ensure protection especially DNA Laboratory either mere collectors even processors DNA collected alternative safeguards place remedy data breaches ensure informed consent Similarly nothing govern sharing sensitive data ensuring purpose limitation maintained
 Profiling surveillance DNA profiles reveal extremely sensitive information individual skin colour illness susceptibility diseases access intrusive information misused specifically target individuals genetic data particularly worrying could used incorrectly link particular castecommunity criminal activities Further event databases linked others worrying databases existence bound give rise Government conducted mass surveillance
 Overbroad provisions Our submission tackles lack legitimate use Bill indicates DNA technology intends used extremely wide criminal civil purposes alarm bells ringing We argue Bill extensive databasing DNA data requires meet conditions set Supreme Courts judgement Puttaswamy one greater public purpose databasing DNA used civil cases fulfill criteria Further even within criminal cases need limit collection DNA investigation prosecution cognizable crimes ensure data DNA database minimal controlled

The submission details plethora concerns ranging lack privacy safeguards informed consent storage sharing information power DNA profiling board

We grateful Committee invited nonofficial witnessesexperts provide views November 27 hope written oral submissions come way taken strong consideration resulting suggestion much required revising Bill

In sub whenever I see post made teenager struggling find job people already graduated seniors college even freaking 12th grade students couldnt get prestigious colleges people always seem suggest try hands programming

I feel advice misguided anyone except college seniors Working software industry requires formal knowledge underpinning various technologies And acquired going formal curriculum Seniors majors pick quickly introductory class computer science freshman year batchmates computer science majors I seen many non computer science majors placed reputed companies learning coding senior year

But talk ones already graduated becomes tremendously hard gather resources devote time go courses Even someone I cant seem understand recruiter might trust skills Having degree internships leads company I think unpaid internships would starter section job seekers But would long term payout get paid job I think one definitely better job get immediate returns rather focusing programming

Finally made write post today people suggesting someone couldnt score well JEE MAINS Most probably OP post hasnt prior introduction programming Doesnt tantamount societys misguided opinion engineeringmedical path success Heck narrowed programming sub I realise suggestion I feel restricts exploring interests Not scoring well entrance exams could red herring wrong path Maybe needs amends

24 September 2019 In todays hearing Supreme Court Facebooks transfer petition seeking transfer Antony Clement Rubin v Union India Madras High Court Supreme Court extensive arguments made parties whether technical complex issues involving encryption addressed judiciary

On 23092019 IFF filed response Facebooks transfer petition reiterated believes problems addressed legislative executive branches government Supreme Court curtail jurisdiction High Courts entertain writ petitions ordinary Indian internet users large multinational tech companies Ordinary Indian internet users residing different parts country allowed approach State High Courts fundamental rights violated Big Tech Indians resources initiate litigation Supreme Court While believe prayers Antony Clement Rubin v Union India misguided strongly oppose attempts weaken encryption also important preserve access justice aggrieved citizens

During todays hearing bench inquired status Draft Intermediaries Guidelines Rules pipeline since December 2018 The Counsel Central Government clarified policy formulation process underway special suggestions sought revise Rules However stated specific timeline notification Rules could provided The Bench comprising Deepak Gupta J Aniruddha Bose J noted misuse technology serious concern technical complex issues best addressed executive branch

The Counsel State Tamil Nadu insisted WhatsApp trying avoid complying Indian law stating technology identify originator information platform true since Dr Kamakoti Professor IIT Madras provided technical solution enable tracing originator In response Senior Advocate Mr Kapil Sibal appearing WhatsApp stated another IIT Professor disagreed Dr Kamakotis proposed solution This reference expert report Dr Manoj Prabhakaran IIT Bombay IFF previously filed Madras High Court Read herehttpsinternetfreedominifffilesindependentexpertsubmissionbeforemadrashc

After hearing submissions Court noted complex issues need decided consultation technical experts judiciary cannot expected implement changes The Court emphasized policy formulation within domain executive policy formulated government subject judicial scrutiny ensure undermine right privacy Since Draft Intermediaries Guidelines Rules actively considered Government Court adjourned matter till 22102019 It directed Solicitor General file affidavit Secretary MeitY within 3 weeks status Rules provide definite timeline process completed

IFFs Executive Director Mr Apar Gupta said following IFFs stance todays hearing

IFF represents Indian internet users fundamental rights Big Tech This requires us take principled positions what’s best outcome possible tough complex situations  
Ordinary internet users ability approach local judicial forums Big Tech lack financial capacity resources travel remote places India judicial forums Supreme Court India New Delhi  This separate substantive position explained stance taken considerable deliberation inputs external team lawyers  
Just like filed technical submission opposing traceability Honble Madras High Court also opposed transfer petition receiving legal advice According us best contest demand traceability social media regulations Honble High Court The High Court judgement course subject appeal parties aggrieved transfer petition dismissed    
Ultimately foregrounding defense standards Shreya Singhal judgement This recommend complex questions rest technical aspects computer science settled executive legislative processes rather courts Any legislative changes regulations also similarly open judicial challenge undermine fundamental rights

The next hearing transfer petition 22 October 2019 keep updated important case progresses IFF represented todays hearing Udayaditya Banerjee Ria Singh Sawhney S Prasanna extremely grateful continued support

Yes may completely wrong inferences believe may matter parental caution social debate certainly penal law We explain dangerous consequences approaching legal issue below

 Prohibitory Order playing PUBG

The Rajkot Police Commissioner issued prohibitory order Section 144 Code Criminal Procedure 1973 March 6 2019 A Section 144 order Criminal Procedure Code 1973 usually made prevent illegal physical assemblies breach peace While large numbers online gamers congregate spend long hours front smartphones gaming consoles much annoyance friends family assemblies rarely unlawful It would stretch call activities threatening public order

Hence surprised Kumar Manish posted tweet

We today able rough translationhttpsdrivegooglecomfiled16xDu9OqcEmEq8fRupJmcORiJv0wfpVvRviewuspsharing prepared English thanks help offered Manan Bhatt

From reading prohibitory order reasonable infer per press reports 7 youths ranging ages 19 26 arrested breach prohibitory order At point found bewildered taken aback seemingly grave attack personal liberty We believe Honble Prime Minister noted conversation concerns online gaming better handled care affection parent teachers Certainly creating fear penal law prohibitory orders issued police subsequent arrests This abhorrent sensibility offends core fundamental rights lacks rationality reasonableness necessary restriction imposed State

In coming days sourcing authenticating information taking steps including talking legal team based Gujarat We hope address issue responsibly meanwhile urge Gujarat government look matter urgently We appeal  jailing people game

Science/Technology,Rant Im seriously tired called education,13,ctzkd1,throwaway93681,6,"This mostly weekly education rant nothing new Throwaway account since Id like stay anonymous wanted let thoughts open

A bit first I loved computers pretty young age time I simply loved hobby I also remember young reading tons books topics like space nature The thing I good middle school Physics Computer Science kinda ignored subjects I also loved helping students subjects extent teachers would point stop noisy get back seat kind synonyms I pretty open future wondering held Anyway I decided pick Engineering

Everything going downward spiral since As typical kid India trying get good Engineering college I went called JEE coaching classes These places horrible Over time I realised coaching classes simply forcing material onto students If actual learning happening given vast syllabus wouldnt surprising whenever high school kid India marked innovation science Rather see students killing able score good marks examination There intense pressure kids since youre constantly told making good college equates woman marrying youre going working awful job jobless In short life going become fucked see kids already making peace death instead And fucking assholes feel helping reducing population country weeding unworthy Just stop making kids rate shit fuckheads Instead making positive effect country coaching centres asking shitload money simply saturating already saturated field Engineering India Some parents also force kids coaching centres faculty flaunting achievements Gods gift world Anyway coaching centres symptom core problem reputed colleges India accept students solely basis one two examinations colleges like seduced AICTE approved college This whole education thing turned fucking business

I failed JEE since I couldnt keep The failure doesnt hurt partially way rejecting system Ive come realisation I cannot learn things solely books paper I need experience reality I cannot digest anything Which I probably good loved Physics Computer Science It costs virtually nothing see things motion see equations really match write computer programs stuff everything makes sense The thing everything way consumes lot time I feel worth Its extremely hard work high school concepts look real world significance time examinations pretty much formulae rote based

Anyway I joined tier3 college hoping least make nice Computer Science since need Computer experience anything But oh lord fuck place Just know I spent high school years learning program writing small scripts manipulate environment eventually I started working people make opensource software So helped get GSoC first year college worked genuine people working hard make positive impact world If GSoC Id also forced attend summer training learn HTML  CSS along students college students kept idle like half session know restrictions put even idle  phones YouTube heads taking break talking students seriously I another friend mine GSoC 2nd year know students supposed attend training institute paying institute money summer break apparently GSoC wasnt considered since seen online course opposed going attending training institute Head Department So rejected Poor guy still pay private institute forged training certificate despite working hard lie worked training GSoC project

Ill talk wonders Our college called Soft Skills sessions instead learning communicate properly people simply taught flaunt bluff every little thing everyone speak hollow words impress people since end college cares headline highest number placements offered Limca Book Records Rather receiving proper technical knowledge spend time practising aptitude questions Many students difficulty communicating structuring grammar forming sentences simple English due unfortunate backgrounds yet work ever done help students become proficient Its 3 semesters since weve studying Software Engineering Software Testing learn craft creating maintain software literally single fucking line code yet Most students still believe testing software looking bugs hand There hasnt even mention automated tests sort till date I 3 years And authorities find students good solving aptitude questions going differentiate making solve CodeChef problems extra classes remaining students merely possession college time

We assigned work team project every semester evaluated professors experience said technology project based These professors end judging students asking standardised definitions desired technology final viva instead actually evaluating asking project specific questions No wonder majority students steal GitHub copypaste projects peers one cares Also assignment questions blunt hardly thinking involved look boom get full marks submitted time Now I could keep listing whatever hell wrong Minimum attendance 75 exams Students forced stay seated heads even concerned subject teacher leave substitute teacher nothing teach InternetWiFi censored company called FortiGuard anyway Internet hardly works Cant eat roam leave campus 12 noon Worst students brainwashed blindly trust authorities believe faculty truly full professionals ones help get job keep repeating words We arent really learning anything actual use

I dont even know whether situation colleges India I happen one

Now helps really nice opensource projects writes technical posts trying best repeat Internet already knows fighting censorship trying help peers random internet people anything technical whenever possible I like care people  All college eats 9 hours including commute everyday I really feel like fucking idiot What I even I dont even want bother money rich man enough feed family happens someday This shit sickening lately Ive started doubting real asshole",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ctzkd1/rant_im_seriously_tired_of_this_is_so_called/
Science/Technology,Guide Building resume college CS Engineering student Part 1  4,35,c87jbg,RejectedCoder,13,"This guide I wanted write since long time I inspired post written college placements forum The end goal guide would land job product based company The prerequisites hate coding need know programming language  least determination learn

I constructing guide whole 4 years engineering Feel free skip add anything extra feel need Ive writing drafts post since week tried organize thoughts excuse disorganization 

This guide might help check boxes

 A computer science student preferably newbie
 Still college preferably 1st year
 Have zeal excel field get relevant jobs
 Have blank resume respect engineering degree

Stage 0  Prework

If new college odds either severely depressed achievements people around overly enthusiastic new beginning unaffected college All okay If basket scared people boasting achievement first year college dont worry It doesnt matter others long lot people boast possess expertise think posses However feel place DM We chat

In prework phase one understand college things work college This best done first year first summer vacation Most colleges cells clubs sort active projects You need talk people go college website find clubs These clubs studentrun run group professors You looking latter well defined problem statements theyd working youve better chances getting good exposure working projects

Make list clubs Know procedure get clubs projects offering  previously done contact point From clubs pick interesting clubsprojects set goal work towards developing skills would help projects

A personal recommendation would avoid highly specific clubs ie club focusing one problem statement trying solve since years might ideal place newbie join Smaller problem statements good

At end stage must goal part one multiple clubs first summer break

Stage 1  Year 1

In first year common branch subjects sciencerelated fieldrelated You might 1 subject semester relates field I sure much help would teachers would teaching subject nonCS people However introductory programming classes good focus classes If dont find helpful read on

We divide 12 months first year 3 quarters 

1 Spend first three months learning least one programming language 
2 In second three months able read code implement things Then pickup programming language like C  Java 
3 In third quarter look trying test learning implementing something useful It small something thats already try implement scratch yourself

Let elaborate three stages clearly  


Stage 11  First Quarter First Year  Learning programming language  
Python easy programming language start You also start CCJava really want skip steps I would ideally suggest start Python Learning resources like Hackerrank Language course Automate The Boring Stuff ebook long Youtube tutorials Learn Python The Hard Way ebook help  
Note  You aim finish 4 sources practically possible three months Follow breadth first learning approach read little write little 

A good step start would aim get 4 stars Hackerranks Python course get good grasp syntax You familiar indentation loops ifelse ladders functions lists tuples dictionaries optionally list comprehension During course feel like something isnt clearly explained Hackerrank navigate section Learn Python The Hard Way refer it

At stage comfortable reading writing Python explore Automate The Boring Stuff try implementing tasks given I looking something onwards chapter 8 book

Alternatively also watch implement code hour long Youtube tutorials make promise make hero zero Python But looks like hack isnt rewarding quite literally copytyping code Youtuber written

Stage 12  Second Quarter First year  Implement  Learn OOP

Many companies outside market look Object Oriented Programming skill After writing Python code probably going curse JavaC skip completely wont believe relevant languages market This one common mistakes people end theyd end learning least one languages If taking Java Id recommend Derek Banas PlaylisthttpswwwyoutubecomplaylistlistPLE7E8B7F4856C9B19 youtube Youd coding hes coding understand code good enough Learn data structures java List Set etc learn Iterators Object Oriented Design Principles Inheritance Interface Extension etc If looking something smaller try Udemy coursehttpswwwudemycomjavatutorial 

Similar courses exist C also homework

Stage 13  Third Quarter First Year  Build something small

So know Python extent Java Youve two paths One build something using PythonJava second learn HTML  CSS  JavaScript build something It something small script receiving data API putting excel sheet calculator The idea experiment check fast build things Once suitably built write test cases If think early write test cases list test cases ExcelGoogle Sheet start testing code boundary cases

For instance written code takes Reddit Thread input gathers comments checks age accounts parent comments returns analytics say many accounts  1 month old less 1 year old etc You need handle test cases internet isnt working URL wrong cant parse authentication token Reddit API wrong thread URL wrong etc Basically everything think   


FAQ

 Should I get internship first year

Ideally I wouldnt recommend internship Work personal projects  college projects  skill development Most internships given first year students petty work would wasting time Its much easier put 2nd year stronger resume

 Should I specialize one field

No Personally lot students restrict learning buzzword fields wrong What buzzword today might relevance tomorrow Focus learning learn learning one technology one area Initially learn little bit lot things slowly specialize field That way specialization click market always strong fundamental pick something else up

 Should I problem solving

Personally I would say yes But optional I feel first year early dive algorithms data structures even though lot colleges teach basics If really interested definitely spend time everyday solving problems Hackerrank  Leetcode  InterviewBit But dont overdo it

Any question wrt first year please ask I keep updating post interesting questions

I writing Part 2 Friday want make long I wanted keep discussions relevant first year engineering",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c87jbg/guide_building_your_resume_while_in_college_as_a/

  Now agriculture scientists extension officers frequent Bade Chakwa neighbouring villages puzzled But outlier local name “American keeda”

  In Palari village American keeda damaged entire maize crop “I farming four five years never noticed insect Pesticides effective them” says Parmeshwar Pandey

  In nine months since FAW spotted India Karnataka last June invaded crops 10 states As taking prescripted route FAW infestation spread Karnataka southern states western Maharashtra Gujarat eastern states

  Besides advancing fast pest also attacking new crops Though detected mostly maize crops—a preliminary calculation estimates affected nearly 170000 hectares ha maize crops—there reports states infested paddy sugarcane sweet corn

Science/Technology,Need change school culture hype around class 10th 12th board exams,37,bn13id,sebthestudent,8,"I currently PhD Biology student university United States America I completed class 10th 2006 class 12th 2008 I scored 783 72 aforementioned board exams respectively During school years I never meritorious student I rather among bottom 4050 students class section academically However I worked really hard class 10th board exam deeply affected final percentage I scored I pretty well mock exams I used give private tuition center I took help academic performance scored much many friends majority ended scoring 85 final board examination

x200B

Till class 10th I studied prestigious public school Delhi As per schools rule student could offered Science heshe scored 80 English Science Mathematics combined My score 777 therefore offered humanities commerce The rule didnt make sense I scored 94 Science mathematics scores always among top 515 high scoring students section  Therefore I changed schools study Science today I earning topmost degree field school thought I good fit

x200B

I suffered depression lack confidence class 10th I used good cricket I suffered well My school carried culture good academically hopeless extracurricular activities well I wanted academically well school prior class 10th lack confidence made really difficult come shell raise glory yes good student seem like glory I terrified I would scared even open textbooks

x200B

Not able get Science made things worse I lost even hope worsened mental health class 12th board exam I remember praying score least 60 night results But today I could talk younger self recommendation would lose hope enjoy like However I still sure environment I lived would help In school days I compelled feel like outlaw among bottom 4050 students class section

x200B

Recently article came Hindu mother congratulating son scoring 60 class 10th She says seen son struggle point giving therefore proud final scores got In time parents also full support So father always strict My father would never come parentsteachers meeting I standards expected But class 10th supportive backed every point possible Getting sort support person huge He tried level best make case school principal I deserve science student last two years schooling But I remember walking school corridor parents trying make last attempt convince school principal I met Geography teacher She congratulated sarcastically ridiculed front parents bad student I It 13 years since gesture instance still registered memory word word

x200B

Therefore makes wonder whether much support system would parents teachers cultures inculcated schools At time parents support didnt help much In fact made feel even horrible responsible letting go tough situations Manier times especially I like believe case low scores class 10th due stroke sheer bad luck But impact grave naive 16yearold

x200B

The point I trying make addition good support system ones parents schools culture dealing young students needs change Teachers big responsibility training future entrepreneurs engineers researchers etc therefore need pay proper regard students selfesteem selfconfidence What might seem simple comment I dont include personal issues teacher might sometime repercussions students mental health might huge

Ironically I got know belowgiven news article geography teachers Facebook post She cheering wonderful mother attempt lift pressure head son young mind I first felt like commenting directly hypocrisy shown least But I think I probably try let memory go head move on

 The business model internet surveillance We build systems spy people exchange services Corporations call marketinghttpswwwschneiercomnewsarchives201404surveillanceisthehtml

Have noticed Whenever someone says youre political usually means youve mentioned group people I dont care about

Or gaslight  saying youre crazy white male straight American enough If dare notice discrimination built systems try distract issue attacking person trying force jump endless hoops arbitrarily defined moral purity

This typical response Reddit Silicon Valleys social media Facebook Twitter Reddit built Them means entitled middleclass white males More specifically middleclass white aged 18 49 male cisgender heterosexual mostly American males They built social media friends The rest us unwelcome guests safe space

 Free Speech versus Diversity

This rest us nonwhite women LGBT others treated badly systems They refuse ban racist violent misogyny homophobia would hurt free speech Their persecution anxiety leads bigotry behind slogans like diversity problem dont shove diversity face George Orwell would proud horrified see twisting words service harmfully bad ideas

 Heres analogy nuclear power used power entire cities give millions people energy centuries destroy cities commit genocide blink eye Should allow secrets materials nuclear proliferate everywhere science knowledge wants free Of course not
 
 Should allow bigotry hatred rule social media speech information wants free Of course not

Now see bigotry hidden Silicon Valley talk free speech Its free costs left us bear This patterns colonisation throughout history Western civilisation History begun repeat internet

In words grasp basic morality anyone isnt like And youll see means people India Brasil around world starting die



 Aadhaars Failure Facebooks Success

The question begins privacy

Aadhaar wellknown allowing unauthorised access private information millions Indias citizenshttpswwwhindustantimescomtechaadhaarbreacheverythingyouneedtoknowstoryVhCKHDIL8lziw6OcnhL4wOhtml People concerned rightfully so

In case Facebook selling privacy highest bidder entire profit model Thats Facebook free Its Aadhaars privacydestroying mistakes Facebooks business plan

For India country 69 citizens live rural areashttpdataworldbankorgindicatorSPRURTOTLZS means 300 million people smartphones risk And unlike Indian governments dependence people Facebook completely unaccountable anyone company shareholders

 Facebooks Plan Colonise India

Starting 2014 Facebook tried give away free Internet rural Indiahttpswwwcnetcomnewswhyindiadoesntwantfreebasics The bargain simple use internet Facebook give free That really means allow us watch record sell data every move make online well give access limited amount internet cost

Thankfully Indias regulators eventually said 2016 Free Basics program stopped

 Facebook Bollywood

If youve watched Bollywood films past years two names youll see hear time You probably guess No SRK Deepika Padukone Also Salman Khan Katrina Kaif

The two names Facebook WhatsApp

Again rural India WhatsApp involved increasing number murdershttpswwwaljazeeracomprogrammeslisteningpost201712deadlyrumoursindiawhatsappdilemma171216091928319html The culprit rumours intentional misinformation spread via Facebooks messaging service WhatsApp

Even though Facebooks attempts colonise India blatant Free Basics program led several deaths WhatsApp still making efforts

Instead regulators trying convince citizens Facebook good celebrities constantly use service Bollywood films

You may known Instagram WhatsApp owned Facebook Now think many times youve seen films real stars background social media accounts someones smartphone Theres even Reddit community specifically Indian people praising Facebookhttpsnpredditcomrindianpeoplefacebook

 To prevent colonisation digital lives must fight back right privacy

So fight amoral companies like Facebook WhatsApp Instagram Twitter

We know free access via Internet advertising another word intrusive surveillancehttpswwwtheguardiancomtechnology2014aug24deepsurveillanceispriceofafreewebadvertising We know rural India many less educated people dying misinformation spread social media And know since 2016 long Facebook Silicon Valley get away dont care

Fastforward today Im adult aged 19 My body gained mass stature man hasnt gained Mr Freezes FreezeRay keep cerebral cortex cool Unless stay inside airconditioned environment wear alien OptiTemp suit cant stop heat bogging cognitive functions Its fact

Peak human Intelligence seldom achieved hot humid climates hence IQ disparity inhabitants temperate tropical regions 

Almost developed nations temperate zone barring Russia North Korea due decades Communist mismanagement Tropical regions mostly poor except Bangaloresized tiny nations like Abu Dhabi Oil Singapore strategic sea hub location etc

If compare within countries temperate zone theres intellectual divide northern southern regions Take Italy example Southern Italy comparatively corrupt poor Northern Italy As theres clear correlation climate intelligence This holds true USA Japan These wealthy nations afford run AC 24x7

According Cold Winter theory Richard Lynn  Ancestors Europeans NorthEast Asians faced extreme winters thus higher intelligence wouldve evolved didnt develop intellect perished Going Eskimos highest IQ Earth isnt case wait author something say it

    Lynn  CWT p 144  argued high intelligence   
    evolve  large populations mutations chance 
    events  likely occur large populations Arctic
    people smaller  populations Asians Europeans and
    therefore mutations beneficial intelligence occur

Well intelligence complex topic influenced host factors like genetics culture birth environment etc Cold weather beneficial brain yields easiest intelligence boost without winning genetic lottery 

The energy required cooling human body greater warming Also brain guzzle 20 total energy since glucose also used regulate temperature brain hot weather less spared process cognition

The people ruled India almost 200 years mighty British living Island yearly day temperature half India 15C vs 31C UV Radiation also quite low scorching sunlight hours Contrary popular belief dark winters dont cause depression

Science/Technology,I planning new digital learning initiative I need help,22,8rsrvc,plannercdali,12,"I finished school education science India deeply concerned state affairs I wish target specific areas

Some complain system promotes ‘rote memorization’ syllabus ‘too theoretical’ ‘practical’ ‘linked everyday life’

The system far worse that

In classes 1 10

There heavy emphasis regurgitation memorised material

There much ‘flab’ syllabus

There less rigour subjects maths science

The school textbooks means enough gain comprehensive picture subject line questioning don’t need anything textbooks

There much focus given seeing students capable analysing new information making pertinent observations

Further questioning students’ side real outlet within traditional syllabus

In classes 11 12

The rate information consumed understood increases dramatically

The school textbooks means enough completely understand subject BUT understanding necessary able survive examinations

Rote memorisation impediment aid success

The line questioning far direct You need stop treating syllabus body remember set tools arsenal fix problem You generate independent results tools given

Every piece information syllabus important useful examinations There nothing can’t know

In world competitive exams

You need go well beyond given syllabus

You need able think creatively come innovative solutions

Emphasis given ability manipulate learnt content within extreme time constraints solve situation

You see problem can’t For first 10 years formal education neurologically adaptive state expect students conformist regurgitative attitude towards academics nearly adults expect analytical creative problemsolving abilities miniEinsteins

There three categories students survive catastrophe

The real prodigies These students quickly learn move ahead existing syllabus go onward I respect admire them

Those whose circumstances give head start This I hated rote memorisation I would bare minimum necessary I’m saying I performed bad academically classes 1 10 It’s others busy memorising whole passages verbatim I looking key words facts building rest exam hall That’s way I kept facade despite lousy work ethic Since I already accustomed never memorising mainly matter adjusting new rate new depth

Those work really really hard I admire sheer determination category often overlap 1 2  many continue verbatim approach clear struggle memorising every case every type problem possible

We need fix We need expose students problemsolving based curriculum day one We also need make syllabus far less topheavy With one two chapters subject every year could whole class 1 10 couple years earlier

In traditional system I would said impossible It needs curriculum change reskilling teachers change public policy bulldozing public opinion school becoming ‘harder’ forcing experimental teaching evaluation methods schoolchildren

In digital world creating adaptive learning system goal far less difficult challenge

In ‘idealscenario’ curriculum I would focus four skills

Critical reading In current scenario learning ‘chapters’ given emphasis checking students actually process new passages information Most students unable selflearn dependent spoonfeeding reason

Critical writing grammar I don’t mean typical ‘partsofspeechindetail’ grammar I mean able differentiate correct incorrect English grammar able apply express new ideas Once students longer memorise passages answer exams — construct sentences

Arithmetic geometry Pretty self explanatory

Logical reasoning This subjectspecific It done way independent particular technical subject In JEE content based PCM actually test us critical thinking logical reasoning ability — using subject medium We don’t use prerequisite subject

I need help subject curriculum testing experts web designers teachers students anybody else feels contribute project



If saw post know about

I really really need help experts education STEM liberal arts technology implementation primarily web design UXUI etc

Otherwise I guess revise 12 years syllabus broken system rewrite execute lecture videos come suitable assessments code adaptive assessment system build website deploy it

All assuming I already know would take least year one person execute  thats assuming working full time

Which I cant

And thats I knew everything myself

Which I dont

What means without help project current form even got started

Even cant join core dev team would huge step forward could direct somehow find support I need project

Thanks

Like many mathematicians compared poetry music mathematics He studied Sanskrit poetry college level Here quote him

 As child I enjoyed studying Sanskrit Sanskrit poetry Indian classical music I saw maths things inspired pursue mathematics When I went college I took Sanskrit lot music computer science physics also mathematics To mathematics common thread subjects

As lover Sanskrit language I know distance statements “Panini’s grammar precedes formal grammar two millennia” “Sanskrit compulsory get job NASA” Then rainbow truths falsehoods them

Here excerpt Education Minister explains Bhargava teaches math princeton 1m30s

 In Princeton class — famous — “Mathematics NonMathematicians” I privilege talks Manjul many occasions I know well And I asked — excites teaching class He said I teach class Sanskrit poetry India poetry mother got house Jaipur Now imagine Manjul trying India …

Aside victimhood continues She can’t imagine mathcs professor talking Panini teaching BNF etc IIT Imagine

But importantly outrightly spreading falsehoods Bhargava I followed work also media appearances time He mindful speaks He never say something stupid “I teach math class Sanskrit”

Many months back I came across interviewhttpwwwrediffcomnewsinterviewaatishtaseerindiaissemiliterateandchetanbhagatisthebestitcando20150205htm Aatish Taseer calls India semiliterate country I quite baffled words Why would someone deep connections India make disparaging comment citizens Its true significance finally hit making sad

Were country billion people opportunities deep contrasts However instead trying bridge divide mend fracture soothe pain keep insisting magnifying gap adding salt wounds 

How become politically incorrect nation How let bigotry define us large extent How let education fail us

As Indians single goal kids reduced clearing entrance exams without realising kind studies getting involved get Were broadening minds ideas enhancing understanding experimenting box ideas science technology No As 1516 year old kids solving questions Recognising patterns Trying understand examiners psyche order get questions correct sometimes spending months even years hallowed halls call coaching institutes If manage set aside hoopla around coaching institutions theyre merely cram schools Even neighbouring China But kids importantly parents dont want told Because deep term cram school conflicts idea education I like many millions also victim Yes I made though But Im illusion exactly Ive achieved Ive crammed smarted way entrance exams recognising patterns understanding important concepts without ever learning think myself

And results front us see This videohttpsyoutubeRfw5nQy5pw popped front page YouTube yesterday I ended watching One kids appears incredibly cocky thinks people werent able qualify IIT I dont blame guy maybe years back Id behaved way But exposes limited understanding education Our entrance exams medical engineering tough huge population That number institutions repute even though IITs dont even rank among best institutes world country embarrassingly minuscule 

College education similar tragedy Teachers merely teach Students merely attend classes Teachers get promoted years students graduate every year The teachers incentive teach dont get promoted performance students dont get recognition using exemplary methods teaching And yet expect students well grasp concepts become contributors society magically Our respect teachers country runs deep Unfortunately blinds us gross callousness jobs As result graduate informed educated citizens capable engaging wide range people variety topics robots Robots capable working efficiently without ability position us grand scheme things without ability question without worldview 

But enough institutional education What think Do even know think Are tolerant enough respectful enough differences opinion Are accommodative enough Do know history Do know country 

In comments section video I shared youll see many plainly abusive comments SC STs made without realising bigoted sound The hatred lower castes clear The hatred often isnt even reservations Its group people think dont deserve specifically allowed go How oblivious shallow deeply rotten pick weakest section society SC STs

The tragedy bigots The tragedy fail recognise bigoted The tragedy inherently casteist society The tragedy constantly fail recognise casteist society 

This videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvYZ1EgsRT1zk interview Ravish Kumar African student exposes limited understanding race He referred gorilla nowhere else capital city country How nation colonised nation past empathise Africans How racist group people treated way colonial powers day In words deeply education system failed us lost ability recognise shared history

If go comments Twitter I dont mean hateful comments directed towards particular group people youll realise incredibly easy find insensitive even hiding hood anonymity An Indian woman religious minority rescued government foreign country astonishing attempt brought deep sense respect government officers diplomats And I read disparaging comments family Twitter day religious nut jobs Add hegemony certain group people hold society whole thing becomes scary 

Bigotry hatred borne ignorance pure cluelessness become disease And I even mention Facebook cesspool hideous ideas Even friends colleagues Ive known long time many cases become absolute hypocrites espousing hatred towards disadvantaged importantly towards different Its conflicting ideas conservatism liberalism Its even right left Its basic decency semblance understanding position Indians world

I excuse prejudice course Having become product system Ive also become victim kind regressive thought processes haunt many May strive least recognise possible mend ways 

We deserve better compatriots Our children deserve better peers And importantly country deserves better citizens

The baby sick pretty good hospital possibly serious heart issue one best specialized cardiac hospital country hospital Thiruvananthapuram They researched developed even prosthetic heart 

The hospital baby taken super specialized hospital made exclusively research treat heart disease kids Its name Pediatric Cardiology Medical College due specialty They take extreme referral cases like one 

This hospital founded independence Maharaja Travancore son crown prince Sree Avittom Thirunal Rama Varma untreatable heart disease since birth led death age six Maharaja wanted one suffer fate hence super specialized hospital research diseases created memory name Sree Avittom ThirunalSAT Hospital time period even normal hospitals rare India

Later another bigger hospital also started last Maharaja next hospital departments called Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute Medical Sciences Technology Trivandrum And hospital pioneers various things field cardiac medical science world The baby taken hospital

This reason baby transported instead hospital country It best option survival baby

Air ambulance ruled critical condition baby much better chances landbased ambulance

Kerala good road network roads narrow due population density state At many places one lane directions Any traffic delay lot The normal journey route take 14 hours yet ambulance reached less half time  6hours 40mins

This done due help volunteers across state A GPS device attached ambulance location transmitted everyone There WhatsApp groups people around state

Since people reading draft policy trying turn post GoI controls premier education bad condition Look arent aware know reality I hoped post solutions cribbing problems Anyway gist drafted policy

Objective

To provide enabling regulatory architecture ten public ten private Higher Educational Institutions emerge worldclass Teaching Research Institutions Right way many policy restriction universities need approval almost everything UGC

What hell mean enabling regulatory architecture 

These draft Guidelines  Regulations contain eligibility criteria selection procedure Regulatory aspects monitoring  evaluation etc World Class Institutions These drafted considering characteristics institutions world class includes exceptionally high quality teaching research standards preferably multidisciplinary areas significant proportion international meritorious students reasonably good proportion qualified faculty highranked universities worldwide transparent needblind system ensure intake meritorious students adequate financial assistance students healthy faculty student ratio wellequipped facilities teaching research administration studentlife adequate infrastructure operations expansion autonomous governance structures financial soundness either large corpus fund recourse public funding case may teaching research collaborations reputed global universities 

The draft Guidelines  Regulations also provides admission procedure fixing appropriate fee structures pursuant internal policies appointment faculty collaboration foreign higher educational institutions design offer courses existing programmes new areas Additionally institutions shall complete financial autonomy spend resources raised allocated

Expectation World class institution

1	It preferably multidisciplinary teaching research focus exceptionally high quality Apart regular courses also offer various interdisciplinary courses including areas emerging technology interest well relevance development concerns countries like India 

2	It good proportion foreign foreign qualified faculty There reasonably good mix domestic foreign students There transparent merit based selection admissions focus remains getting meritorious students                          


3	There laboratory facilities cuttingedge scientific research Institutions engaged scientific research In case humanities social science interdisciplinary areas faculty engaged research field work frontier areas using latest methodologies 

4	It student amenities comparable globally reputed institutions It student enrolment least twenty thousand students period fifteen years The faculty student ratio less 110 three years declaration World Class Institution 

5	It come top five hundred world renowned ranking frameworks Times Higher Education World University Rankings QS Shanghai’s Jiao Tong University first ten years setting declared World Class Institution 

Financial assistance WCI

The assistance would amount Rupees five hundred Crore Institution span five years 201617 202021 The annual release would dependent institution achieving financial physical outcomes laid implementation plan However Institution shows capacity absorb funds earlier able give expected outcomes accelerated pace funding would also allowed The funding guidelines would addition existing funding entitled to

Linkhttpindianexpresscomarticleindiameteorologicalpredictionsarenotperfectweneverclaimthatitisasciencewedoourbestdsivanandapaiimd 


On unreliable forecasts IMD
 I admit meteorological predictions perfect We never claim 100 per cent right It science best 
 Rainfall never equally distributed throughout city So generally forecasting exact rainfall value particular location possible For eg case recent rains Mumbai regional variation high within city Dharavi recorded 56 cm rainfall Santacruz 33 cm Colaba 10 cm 
 Nature deterministic It chaotic system A high degree randomness prevails even best models cannot eliminate uncertainty
 Nature behave manner every time still discrepancy model result actual event We need aware 
 inherent limitations


On comparison accurate forecasts countries
 I would say partially correct We give accurate forecasts cyclones Other countries accurate forecasts shortrange daytoday variation radar coverage lesser uncertainties weather systems However extended range seasonal forecasts much better them
 There difference weather events countries India England lies extratropical region Their weather dictated frontal systems much stable predictable India hand tropical belt There randomness weather events
 In US Europe entire area tracked radars It gives better shortrange forecasts We don’t radars  continuously monitor every region wasn’t considered costeffective We need 3040 Doppler Radars We process getting Once radars shortrange forecasts also improve But cyclone forecast one best world 


On availability best technology
 We good computer system upgraded December We good weather models Many IMD officials charge technical committees WMO I chairing technical team WMO provides regional climate outlook If best would picked jobs 
 India globally acknowledged level developed countries weather forecasting
 There many issues apply meteorology general like datacollecting capability oceans good Even land difficult get data certain areas Afghanistan


IMD world front
 People WMO take India natural leader meteorology part world Our scientists well respected
 India natural leader asked prepare forecasts South Asia also train countries region

Science/Technology,Hi rIndia TRAI wants know hold telecom operators accountable mobile data speeds Heres make voice heard,215,6esgm8,shadowbannedguy1,11,"Firstly consultation paper Consultation Paper Data Speed Under Wireless Broadband PlanshttpwwwtraigovinsitesdefaultfilesCPDataspeed01062017pdf PDF

What this

TRAI wants know mobile Internet providers held accountable data speeds advertise Mobile data speeds much variable unpredictable fixedline broadband connections TRAI looking whether make label telcos mandatory specifies kind speeds customers expect connections TRAI also wants know kind tech use measure fast telcos connections actually subscribers

Sounds great How I send ideas

First take deep breath Telcos going really long answer consultation lobbying polished elaborate  want regulated If concerned citizen need make voice heard counted

Telecom consultation filings rocket science You send good insightful response wont take hour two Remember response read TRAI administration leans towards consumers

Draft response This take long You month send response spend couple days collating points want mention response order subheads work answers question

Make PDF Word Document response email kapilhandatraigovin

Cool Whats deadline

The deadline 29th June You email TRAI ask extend deadline feel time adequate usually extend deadlines upon request But try get right telcos TRAI may read responses ge them

The deadline countercomments equally important stage counter arguments made responders 13th July 

What questions

Here questions TRAI wants answer emphasis mine text slightly edited clarity If feel like dont know context questions check consultation paper probably answer questions might existing regulatory framework telcos face

Q1 Is information wireless broadband mobile internet speeds currently available consumers transparent enough help make informed choices

Q2 If difficult telcos commit minimum download speed could an
average speed specified service providers What should
be parameters calculating average speed

Q3 What changes brought existing framework on
wireless broadband tariff plans encourage better transparency
and comparison plans offered different service
providers

Q4 Is need include delete QoS parameters
andor revise benchmarks currently stipulated the
Regulations

of time peak times including broadband factslabels
be made mandatory

Q6 Should standard applicationwebsites identified mandating
comparable disclosures network speeds

Q7 What productstechnologies used measure
actual enduser experience mobile broadband networks At

device network node

Q8 Are legal security privacy data sensitivity issues
with collecting device level data

a If issues addressed  
b Do issues create challenge adoption any
measurement tools

Q9 What measures taken increase awareness among
consumers wireless broadband speeds availability of

Science/Technology,Spoiler Alert Only people watched dont care ever watch  My Analytical Review movie Dunkirk,23,719nda,concernadian,12,"While Inception interstellar though fascinating unrealistic defied rules science mathematics common sense Dunkirk Christopher Nolans best movie yet I recently watched I wanted key thoughts see else people may gleaned movie I gleaned something pertains IndiaChina standoffs among things

So basically Dunkirk 400000 men British French stranded enemy territory WW2 With enemy closing sides British waiting rescue get back Britain visible across channel Dunkirk Situated France Thats basically However movie spans much unique Nolan mindwrangling makes interesting simple premise stated above

The movie begins staggered timeline It follows pilots Spitfires 40minute long journey Dunkirk follows struggle 3 soldiers ships water trying escape beach days It even ends staggered timeline following seamen soldiers days incident following pilot minutes climax IMO apart trying capture chaos war reflects two things  1 The British Navy Army existed hundreds years airforce relatively new It may also symbolic fact nations existed forever continue exist forever even face new ones may come 2 The advent new technology makes us dependent We see dive bombers keep killing thousands sinking rescue destroyers soldiers keep asking airforce

Next focuses butterfly effect Farriers fuel gauge broken given choice turn back chooses stay course ends saving entire rescue If chosen turn back planes shot wouldnt shot rescue may taken place effective       
Similarly Tommy tagged Gibson along ends saving lives opening door ship sinking torpedo 

We also see massive powerful destroyers bombed enemy unable rescue stranded soldiers feat accomplished civilian boats This highlights fact military might country spirit people wins wars  something Winston Churchill alluded one addresses nation Also tries present one underestimate small nations like Britain represented small boats may accomplish feats big nations represented destroyers may able achieve There also another moment soldiers ask civilians Moonstone saying let didnt reiterating fact military may let country country let soldiers We also see spirit people see Dawson son heading fearlessly towards Dunkirk rescue stranded soldiers Shivering soldier Fortis leader afraid go back many times tries force change course However hold steady determined complete mission We also see civilians trust quick effective military bureaucratic red tape Dawson doesnt wait navy sets exact thing requisitioned 
 And part movie I would like mention relates India The fact strength military isnt everything war spirit nation matters India never cower China They may better machines better people

Next elements poetic justice movie We see Tommy stands Gibson Dutch boat saved Moonstone Highlander wants sacrifice Gibson French Tommy member Highland regiment forced come air burnt alive  poetically speaking burns hell Then Alex pragmatic vs Tommy moralistic comparison face resolution guilt different times While Tommy considerate observant remember one talks grouping bullet holes notices man handing blankets train station blind When old guy says well done asks But I survive old guy says  Thats enough His guilt burden resolved peacefully sleep train Alex hand superficial nature burning guilt less regard others thinks guy ashamed cant even look eyes He faces guilt night even reads hatred people headlines newspaper cannot look people sees applauding spitting faces This reflects see world lot feel inside It also touches upon fact ultimately soldiers guilt burden lessened country feel successful nation makes feel Their victory fronts eyes nation always want validation We also see Peter tells Fortis leader George okay even though dead It suggests sort duty civilians grant clemency soldiers relieve burden

Also movie seems sort touch fact one good soul worth many average souls It seems like good people keep taking place many average people movie eg Gibson saves Tommy Alex others drowning ends drowning Farrier saves 300000 British soldiers beach dive bombers army broken perimeter ends taken hostage Germans It always seems like take place many good people God HeavenUniverse content exchange one soul souls many Also shows miracles dont happen Every miracle cost life someone else someone elses sacrifice someone elses gain

Then glorification war duty towards glorifying How young men encouraged die futility many times name war We see aboard Moonstone Dawson Peter George set sail rescue stranded men While Dawson Peter save many men fulfill important mission George joins wants hero war zone wants photograph paper He observing trying make useful ends dying could actually something substantial Again futile deaths suffering war highlighted man trying escape destroyer gets caught ferry destroyer ends crushed legs Also difference Dawson Peter look Shivering Soldier leader Fortis air trio While Dawson tries understand pain looks human Peter looks coward wanting die war In end however see experience changes Peter gives clemency Fortis Leader lying saying George fine We see Dawson approves Again reflection war changes people reflection duty towards soldiers duty towards nation We also see irony Dawson sympathizing plight Shivering soldier afraid go war kills George trying prevent Dawson rescuing soldiers Dawsons son died war We see effects war people camera shows Peter Tommy two people almost age one weighed horrors war lad coming terms disillusionment war      
We also see civilians make heroes Heroes formed nation accepts We see Peter Dawson get Georges picture printed newspaper Peter gains satisfaction This reflects every life lost battle treated respect irrespective circumstances satisfaction loved ones childrensiblingsspouse make ultimate sacrifice vain even many wars futile

Then contrast thinking people accordance ranks situations The soldiers fighting Dutch boat want sacrifice French nonHighlanders survive On hand French Gibson saves Tommy Alex twice opening door second time slipping rope boat We also see discord French soldier asks Tommy move along French line beach beginning movie The admiral hand wants stay back help Fench end movie We seen earlier movie admiral saying get army back next battle happen Britain seems dejected Britain seems dejected Britain seems hold destroyers saving next battle Again see military let people civilians never Another example Highlanders boat refuse let Tommy Alex Gibson slips rope We also see spirit civilians hail arrival soldiers done survivedOn hand ranks may really mean much see Farrier ends saving day Fortis Leader trembling mess ends killing civilian In movie tries highlight soldiers ordinary men best survive extraordinarily stressful events one minute one event time

It also focuses efforts many remain unsung war Like soldiers accuse Collins aka airforce enough station Dawson reassures know Again country never lets soldiers nations validation important soldiers fighting it

Then ending The fact Farrier keeps gliding even last drops fuel run captures spirit soldiers nation fight last breath The fact even dying manages save thousands people shooting last plane shows even soldier country going save people countries give miracle living Of Farrier instead ejecting plane lands gives proper patriotic sendoff burning Which goes show people country dont jump goes respect end even burning due war internal struggles whatever It also reflects fact though main player may gone Farrier many people survived would carry legacy lines ending movie says even Britain went colonies abroad would carry legacy  I words regarding legacy colonies point movie And lastly show Plane flames structure still stands respectfully good person like Farrier showcases entire Europe burned World Wars making spirit structure Europe survived due good men Again reflection respect country determined character people

In entire movie themes common Wars armies spirit people Armies may let countries country never lets Poetic justice finds way How war changes people duty citizens laud soldiers choose fight regardless everything

I also appreciated small things incorporated eg beginning dive bombers bomb beach explosions far away sound delayed visual explosion explosions come near delay decreases Something correct according laws physics I never seen depicted movies commented head watching movies past Then Tommy meets Gibson attending natures call Its wrenching survived attack life goes attend business It disturbing attacks lives routine soldiers reading newspaper us movie captures well Then dive bombers throw bombs bridge Tommy covers ears Its depiction war hero like many movies true depiction soldiers humans chose go war face horrible situations It also depicted Farrier shows perplexion uncertainty many times I really liked Dutch merchant sailor nowhere came help guys The fact none army men knew anything tides anywhere The fact presence mind helps people crazy stunts machine guns brawn  like Tommy decides take stretcher get aboard ship Farrier keeps track fuel asking Collins The incident Dutch doesnt understand ballast told weight Just little things quite meticulous

Thats I put together right I shall add I think something else I forgot jot someone brings good point Let know gleaned",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/719nda/spoiler_alert_only_for_people_who_have_watched_it/
Science/Technology,Kota District Collectors letter parents IIT aspirants NP,184,4i91ig,grasssrootz,40,"Dear Parents

On behalf Kota City I take opportunity welcome child city wonders processes young minds country fuels passion become architects Modern India

My humble request beginning letter read patience time would ideal parents read together

It dream every parent see child touch pinnacles success reach places afford Every parent plants seed mind child period time bears fruits careful nourishment tendering since seed tender mishandling may fail us realizing dream

It difficult situation parents leave child place live things become still difficult purpose child left behind dedicated committed efforts scaling excellence education

When parents look huge billboard signagehoarding newspaper clips depicting pictures young beautiful children achieved dream child resolution inspire motivate children becomes still stronger

Good career field Engineering  Medicine case may less like certain insurance terms decent earning living standards I sincerely think cases reason makes us dream careers children

There nothing wrong thinking certain kind Assured Career Insurance one’s child since limited resources high degree competition demands one think ahead times

However I think agree world changed drastically last 1520 years much facilities services available limited available many due huge progress technology witnessed period

Art Entertainment Professional Sports Literature Health  Fitness Entrepreneurship Journalism Photography Event management Music Adventure Destination tourism etc name witnessed immense growth comparison bygone era

Many even created new niche nurtured creative potential human mind capabilities also successful career options

Well point asking see better options certainly see also options

It matter fact today young children facing immense amount pressure relating academic performance due many go various levels stress

Even consider certain element stress would exist competition parental support care right kind family situations would help child cope difficult situation

However current reality due lack right kind conditions support systems many children going stress uncared unattended cases situations disabled children extreme extent committed suicide…

Don’t get frightened suddenly said child… Your child perfectly safe sound reasons worry reasons concern child I believe understand read letter further

I consider unfortunate person I got chance read around 2025 Suicide Notes Young Brilliant Beautiful Wonderful Children

Am I giving many adjectives children committed Suicide

I sorry Answer No… They fact I said earlier Young Brilliant Beautiful Wonderful Children

A Girl amazing command English language suicide note grammatically perfect 5page Suicide Note beautiful running handwriting thanks mother giving career raising children… Subtle hint pricked matter again

Another girl wants grandmother become mother next birth Another requests parents allow younger sister likes like One tells candidly manipulated study science taste Many simply write fewer lines could fulfil expectations parents Rather say really capable asked them

All thought Death much peaceful effortless action going dilemma artificially parents want do

As say “Tip Iceberg” reveals little hides mountains within similarly apparent Suicide Cases reflect numbers reality hidden mountain children opt take extreme step certainly going stressworryanxiety due pressure performance

Many Parents cannot believe disaster child took drastic measure I don’t mean hurt sentiments reality child mentally looking blade grass drowning man searches That blade grass could simple appreciation efforts… solacing words comforts asking best forget results absolute unconditioned appreciation extraordinariness

In return child got threats performing still better…psychological manipulation repeat retelecasting hardships gone sake family comparison better performers neighbors relatives children colleague ancestors…could anyone sharing imagination lossnotional gain social status dependent child’ performance

We need understand statistically speaking many children commit suicide comparison total number children coping academic pressure analyze numbers life analysis tells us hopes dreams overlooked hurt many times So high time pause contemplate bit I need take pause since I hear many saying kids like many things good So question I tend hear is… Should parents go childrenâ€™s immature ways Not necessarily

Well let us try see good things resisted… Eating right sleeping right talking right behaving right seeing right listening right reading right etc

Child actually observes parents never follows anything blindly Moreover one thing certain… Child analyses looks parents see whether case things preached followed parents begin soWhether parents really loving joyful peaceful happy so

They tend pick habits parents make happy peaceful…In case seriously messed situations child may even like you

It may appear strange extremely annoying… But possibility child liking you… This comes many forms shades Absolute dislike liking traits liking comparing someone better liking protective care concern may think love suffocating child liking double standards may have… etc

So objective letter make realise child dislikes you

Answer big No Your child dislike you… I making point unconsciously may created situation need undo…

Children parents’ responsibility one teach parent responsibility intend so… Parents really think good children’s future point I need make dreams always limited experience good… successful… best thing… Well truth child may surpass imagination reach places never even dreamed of…

We come different segments society terms social  economic status culture religion belief systems etc However far natural principle upbringing child concerned remain everywhere

I expert Parenting many credentials “Right Child Care Practices” I fully understand different kind children need different kind interventions yet I would request divert little attention fundamental aspects relating child management

Creating right kind atmosphere child grow flower home making home really happy loving peaceful place live
Understanding needs children There two extremes case…Making child go terrible hardships realise “Your” dreams one end end overpampered care… Both definitely work

Take time switch teaching mode learning mode child since children show way really happy peaceful times…Instead learning form tend always assume role teacherpreacher

Allow child “to be” terms I mean especially child’s engagement nature world around empower right kind communication skills accommodative Interaction gender due coming age aberration normal process keep note try prevent totally

Spend time children without complaining office life situation problems hardships timeâ€¦ It may really late want spend time available child Why Because may made like effort tutor We certainly benchmark child Many times may regressive rudimentary types comparison ability child

Just final thought Are interested making child realise “Your Dreams” cost like creating situations child realises “HisHer” Dreams

I could simply attended Parents Counselling Session admission spoken issues usually happens gatherings conditioned influenced impression person sitting next people think different

Nothing wrong disagreeing best disagree terms instead getting influenced others Finally I would like tender unconditional apology taking time telling things Child Management I expert words letter gathered limited experience Kota dealing similar cases certainly great men inspired put thoughts you

Be Best Parent World
I sure competition there

Why think  The NSA SIS GHCQ FBI etc make point hire top security professionals even hire interns directly universities The candidates selected consider good career path terms serving nation terms intellectual satisfaction Compare state India RAW IB dont even dedicated website I understand need secrecy least fucking portfolio One cannot even directly apply RAW One needs join government department one gets transferred like seriously Just look NSAhttpswwwintelligencecareersgovnsa GHCQhttpswwwgchqcareerscoukrecruitmentprocesshtml FBI httpwwwfbiagenteduorgcareerscybercrimes SIShttpswwwsisgovukscienceandtechnologyhtml career websites look Indian IBshttpmhanicinvacancies No isnt even webpage specific IB like I said one cannot directly get RAW Would person actually skilled even want apply work I dont think so

I someone wanted research living physics specifically various circumstances forced bachelors degree electronics communications engineering India I previously markedly Western system could cope forced finish degree anyway It took 7 years finish reappear papers piling I 25 years old low undergraduate gpa 612210 I still interested research I dont know go I hoping research physics I still discussions I may change things bit

Ive discussed bit Ive heard reddit parents As far things go financially I pretty dependent Now way discussion went last time I get feeling might getting impatient taking long bachelors already letting I either get program already get job soon No preparation exams anything unless going take 23 months less I dont know enough time even I study night day Besides shouldnt I gain conceptualresearch knowledge

From options I gotten Reddit basically boils mostly getting MSc Id rather avoid India mostly I fed educational system People learn parrot textbook instead actually becoming skilled chosen field may option I I pretty much followed curriculum No extra curricularsresearch experiences Any practical laboratory work listed transcripts pretty much paper I mean like I havent handled soldering rod circuitry CROs small stuff hasnt One redditor mentioned may easier MSc India first get research experience attempting post baccalaureate courses beef resume going abroad mentioned issue parents allow

The problem comes due intervening periods It doesnt help parents despite trying act progressive still limited traditional thinking I cant exactly blame money relatively limited resource family time passing exactly helping long term plans Due theoretically I cannot take time prepare exams universities JNUs physics MSc entrance exam something I able work post baccalaureate courses since take time AND money Practically I would probably work find job long I dont find job I would keep preparing exams I juggle trying keep knowledge required job obviously test outright rejecting based grades prelim exam andor interview That get clerical job I dont know even possible burgeoning population

Now first question guys following fields might easier pursue research They may somewhat related bachelors field well physics I interest I asking guys advise I putting case know would easier go research currently fields Anyway fields are

1 Quantum information science computing information theory etc  Our field involve conventional computing information theory

2 Quantum deviceselectronics though I dont really much like sound I didnt realize particular distinction conventional electronics quantum electronics To knowledge standard electronics based understanding QM phenomena

3 Photonics  Study optical phenomena derivative technologies optical waveguides splitters couplers etc also focused somewhat field

4 PhotovoltaicsRenewable Energy Research general  Photovoltaics probably focus I put second part emphasize intention research well tangential research interests

5 Condensed Matter physics This general electronics I dont expect easier case

6 Physics computersinformation  sure since seems like could fall information theory

7 Dynamic systems theory control theory chaos theory quantum chaos etcStudy Complex Systems  Our branch lot mathematically modelling various systems many different ways observing effect various inputs feedbacks outputs

My second question everybody would I accomodate constraints financial constraints particular note Basically I get program seeing may unlikely I may get job instead But I dont know I get anything sub par clerical job degree grades I sure would help long term plans To sum I really confused next step take Please advise",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5rq4gj/serious_seeking_advice_from_rindia_since_most/
Science/Technology,History India Indus valley civilization survives latter conquered vedic aryans,1,9b4xnx,proudman4lyfe,2,"Pre vedic age 1500 BC 1000 BC
While Rig Veda composed time line 1500 BC penned 1200 BC  The core philosophy rig Veda formulated prior 1500 BC scholars debate exact time developedWhile agreed core philosophy evolved 18001600 BC  The rig vedas written vedic sanskrit closely related early avestan language
While rig Veda goes details life lead vedic Aryans contains hymns sung praise gods parts rig vedas deal philosophy metaphysical matters

vedic Aryans time line left central Asia around 1800 BC well Iranians left Iran While I dont want get arguments whether vedic Aryans came directly andronovo culture andronovo oxus river valley civilization Hindu kush mountains mordern day Greater Punjab rest India

But time line rig veda composed 1500 BC latter 1000 BC  In time line vedic Aryans encounter resistance settled mordern day Punjab remnants indus valley civilization disappeared people resided Punjab These people absorbed vedic Aryans While certain conflicts natives vedic Aryans also vedic Aryans indo Aryans tribes scale Iranian tribes conflicts Scythians Elamite urartu neo Assyrian empire also people iranian plateau These conflicts played crucial role unification various Iranian tribes With vedic Aryans lack serious threats resulted conflicts eg bàttle ten kings banks river Ravi

Further since collapse indus valley civilization urbanization Indian subcontinent received huge set back since major urbanization takes place till 500 BC thats gap nealy 1300 years collapse indus valley civilization

In time line The indus valley civilization collapsed around 1900 BC caused due change course indus river also due change climate occurred time period caused collpase river valley civilization around world also caused movement various tribes including vedicaryans Iranian tribes  The collpàse accelerated civil war diseases leprosy tuberculosis

In alternate time line indus valley civilization survived though initially suffered climatic changes change course indus river never suffer outbreaks diseases civil war  Thus civilization survived The people civilization adapted change built new cities settlements though new settlement cities size former cities settlements But nonetheless civilization survived recovering
It 17001600bc vedic Aryans began settle around modern day Afghanistan otl 1500 BC vedic Aryans began raids river valley civilization Most raids resisted vedic Aryans driven back beyond Khyber pass The indus valley civilization point time made single empire sprung times trouble 1900 BC  While much known empire know vedas empire centralised entity worshipped false gods The indus valley empire able defeat certain vedic Aryans tribes Indo Aryan tribes subjugate These tribes made pay tribute return empire offered protection vedic Aryans tribes thus forming effective buffer states

This state affairs continued till 1300 BC vedic Aryans face threats migrating Iranian tribes also pressure indus valley empire united leadership Bharatha tribe  While confederation intially cause lot trouble indus valley empire confederacy vedic tribes busy fighting Iranian indo Iranian tribes north  These tribal war lasted century While vedic Aryans successful iranian tribes successful indo Iranian tribes north assimilated tribes vedic Fold increasing size territories

This increase size caused concern indus valley emperor sought break conferdacy tact diplomacy also military campaign It times according many scholars major political changes took place vedic Aryans confederation The vedic Aryans tribes period time went nomadic pastorialist settled farmers even though significant number tribes nomadic  The vedic Aryans also influenced governance style indus valley empire began adopt system government indus valley empire They aslo began combine elements warfare practice indus valley empire  Soon vedic Aryans strong enough take indus valley empire

In around1200 BC vedic Aryans tribes leadership Bharatha tribe declared war indus valley empire ground empire interfering internal affairs vedic Aryans tribes At time vedas noted like ant declaring war elephant The empire though concerned make much threat thus ill prepared deal new powerful vedic Aryans

The vedas time line noted war lasted 22 years major conflicts decided first ten years last revolt subjugated empire occured 22 year war began  This leads us conclusion war ten years rest 12 years vedic Aryans spent time putting revolts

Consequences conquest indus valley empire vedicaryans history Indian subcontinent

A Popularity centralised state absolute monarch ruling vast empire

Any person studied political science knows vast empires create centralised state favours absolute monarchy vicea versa especially time advent mordern day communication

In time line Bharatha merged puru tribe create powerful kuru kingdom mordern day Pakistani Punjab time line merger take place change name Bharathas time line leaders vedic Aryan tribal confederation name change question While much known kings Bharatha tribe 1200 BC post 1200 BC complete list kings  While scholars time line time line agree Bharatha tribe meger tribes tribal council called sabha samithi society egalitarian democratic nature time line series merger tribes absorption non Vedic Indo Aryan tribes assuming leadership tribal confederation importantly influence indus valley empire lead creation new form political structure absolute kingship  While time line around 500 BC strong monarchical states emerged would take another two hundred years first empire known Nanda empire would emerge empire Alexander greats troops already de moralized refused face empire war said Nanda empire largest powerful army world concept absolute kingship emerge nandas Mauryan Empire concept absolute kingship evidenced hatered Maurays Mahajanapada vice versa also Arthashastra

In time line absolute kingship known vedic Aryan tribes followed indus valley empire adoption vedic Aryans subsequent conquest indus valley civilization vedic Aryans caused huge butterfly event  The concept absolute monarchy much unknown vedic Aryans championed time line first major consequence change time line The consequences change many folds  The obvious one centralised government popular elites masses time line Further absolute monarchy combined centralised state encourages unity uniformity political level extent even cultural level religions time line general Hinduism particular champions cause absolute monarchy centralised state including large empires  Further history centralised control absolute monarchy creates incentive large empire achieve centralised control regin absolute monarch reasonable manner large empires pre requisite instead small medium sized confederation characterized time line history India time line characterized strong authoritarian central government ruling large empire

B Urbanization subcontinent

While timeline second wave urbanization takes place around 500 BC time line since indus valley civilization survived people continued live 1052 urban settlement spread throughout indus valley civilization time collapse time line The vedic Aryans conquest soon begin adopt urban life style many nomadic pastorialist settle become farmers indus valley whose population recovering since times trouble 1900 BC massive influx people west begin settle cultivate fertile indus valley resulted revival agriculture river valley seen since days mature harappa civilization timeline

The indus valley civilization advances science technology much knowledge irrigation system time line main cause decline  While time line learn irrigate land survive result knowledge irrigation poor best compared vedic Aryans good experiences knowledge irrigation systems irrigated arid lands central Asia middle bronze age  The vedic Aryans like time line began irrigate land building canals small dams brought lands cultivation made agriculture indus valley less dependent upon unpredictable monsoon increased agricultural output land many folds This period time lead increase population indus valley importantly resulted urbanization indus valley surplus agricultural production Thus foundation urbanization secured
Further urbanization requires strong central government discussed previous point say logical consequence central government built new renovate old cities increase control bring revenue form taxes industries trade commerce
The retention knowledge experience indus valley civilization already discussed beginning
These factors cause increase urbanization aswell primitive industrialization latter spread throughout sub continent

C Increase foreign trade consequently increase knowledge foreign lands

While may come surprise many people indus valley civilization proficient conducting sea voyage experts building rocks ports  The best example proficiency docks ports lothal present day indian state Gujarat While vedic Aryans known much sea trade aswell land trade  This resulted indian subcontinent cutoff social technological development foreign lands consequence isolation social economic scientific development subcontinent shared foregin lands resulted delayed stunted development subcontinent various areas 

An active foreign trade accelerated impact urbanisation artisans metal smiths industries much larger market cater point view government increase amount revenue form taxes
In time line vedic Aryans inhabitants indus valley civilization come contact Elamite neo Babylonian empire neo Assyrian empire various Iranian tribes Iranian plateau result contact apart increase prosperity result foreign trade people subcontinent also come contact foreign ideas scientific development people middle East India  While cause huge butterfly effects political arena impact contact religion science technology clear There increase speed scientific technological advances see time line opinion result major changes course political military events rather change standard living people around ancient world To give example contact people Iranian plateau advanced knowledge irrigation systems people subcontinent begin use irrigation techniques Iranians improve irrigation system thereby increasing crop yields using deliver water cities much efficient manner

D Socio religious changes

The indus valley civilization time mature stage developed complex social heirrachy  While details social order known time line time line also deatils known caste system emerged time line may social order prevailed alternate time line indus valley civilization certain changes While caste system rigid caste system time line allow individuals communities improve status  It fact caste system time line rigid Guptas lost power due invasion hepthalites islamic invasion india caste system de generated ridiculously stupid system emerged parallel power state authority filp side helped hindus preserve customs tradtion locking state perpetual stagnation time line caste system remain liberal compared time line reason strong central government Monotheistic religion combined high level urbanization industrial growth Any person studied indian history knows strong Hindu state emerged caste system always weakened even zenith caste rigidity 10th 17th century Monotheistic movements within hinduism emerged enemy caste system common doctrine movements people equal eyes god one god children They stood discrimination grounds caste especilly parctise untouchability  opinon kinda stupid common values ethics system kept united promoted group solidarity In time line form government centralised autocratic monarchy religion Monotheistic caste system like class system practice untouchability never heard people social classes given access place worship public places  Further time line concepts karma papa punyajanma  punar janma etc present dont develop complex concepts used justify caste system concept free popular vidhi Brahma lipi Fate simple English fate  non Indians reading suggest google concepts I written herein impact social development indian subcontinent

As I stated beginning hinduism time line MONOTHEISTIC hindus worship lord Brahma regard fire image Brahma thus much like zoroastrian people hindus time line also construct fire temples

The reason hinduism time line borrows heavily proto Zoroastrian ideas beliefs fact vedic sanskrit early avestan language similar since hindus time line active contact Iranian tribes Iranian plateau place proto Zoroastrian religion practised lot concepts religion makes way hinduism  While gods indus valley civilization assimilated vedic Aryan religion Demi gods

The reason hinduism time line Monotheistic puts emphasis free good vs evil birth place hinduism Brahmanism known time line limited Punjab case time line whole indus valley Afghanistan Balochistan since development Vedas religious concepts delayed wars vedic Aryans fought Iranian tribes indo Aryans tribes also indus valley empire vedic Aryans put value unity order wars crucial impact society vedic Aryans warriors noble family establish dominance priestly class warrior valued intellectuals people recites hymns Further since place development hinduism extensive geographical terms subject foreign influence trade time line vedic Aryans come contact proto Zoroastrian ideas eastern Iranian plateau vedic sanskrit early avestan language similar making possible ideas free  good vs evils aand Monotheistic ideas cross Iranian plateau vedic Aryans tribes indus valley What may also makes cross hinduism concept good evil similar concept Hinduism time line Dharma Adharma concept Dharma much complex concept good evil equivalent concept Dharma justice lord justice lord Yama lord world concept good evil make hinduism may become mazadyasna Brahmanism time line hindus still concept Dharma Adharma since Monotheistic religion time line lord underworld justice also lord universe one God Brahma  So time line goal moksha  freedom birth rebirth ultimate goal hindus complex ideas punya papa dominant makes way concepts In time line idea deeds man previous life determined caste born life see light day time line free important concept God made every person capable taking ones decisions person doesnt lead life righteousness born world  While concept heaven hell present  result cross proto zoroasterian concepts concept 7 janamas person judged deeds lord  Salvation heaven moksha means becoming one supreme becoming part god ie Ahambrahmasmi concept Rigveda timeline remains important concept time line also  As hell well nothing much say hell

While Monotheistic hinduism time line also concept Demi gods souls great individuals death earn super natural powers god  This vedic Aryan concept strictly speaking Dravidian concept case time line Demi gods person object natural formation outstanding warrior  great emperor great administrator mountain river  sun etc fire temples built Demi gods shrines build honour prople evoke supreme Brahman Demi gods daily life  While intiallly individual object could raised status Demi god people approve  But latter history status granting status Demi god became regulated Hindu religious order clearical class Hindu faith interfered preserve power 

Being Monotheistic advantage simple religious practices unlike complex religious practices characterized Hindu faith time line  The effect Buddhism Jainism counter religious movements main cause movements pointless Hindu rituals ceremonies whose meaning become lost time A simpler religious ceremonies better social system ensure stability time progress

The religious changes explained extent evolution Hinduism covered eras example vedic period vedas composed details Vedas provided changes Nanda empire era Greek invasion introduction Hellenistic religion subcontinent popularity indus valley Hindu Kush mountains Mauryan Empire era vedic hinduism reached zenith  civil war era challenge vedic orthodoxy became prominent Gupta empire era vedic Brahmanism revived Gupta emperors religious fanatics introduced concept forced conversions religious persecution certain religious movements prathihara empire like confederation empire tolerant towards people faiths watch Sassanian elite flee India lands khorasan Hindu Kush mountains absorbed shansabani eastern Iranian tribes time line remained Hindu regin kings India took title shah Shahenshah ud Aryan ya anaryan various Turkic dynasty ruled India 1256 1730 Turks time line convert hinduism usually tolerant outlook persecuted minority religion Maratha empire 1730 1905 republic India 1905 present

Date entry 2882018

The social structure

While much known social structure indus valley empire vedas time line goes depth new social structure came The king Bharatha king kings Aryans pratipa knew new subjects especially elites never reconcile vedic Aryans together samithi  elite vedic Aryans conferderation formulated plan integrate newly conquered lands empire While intiallly plans converting people indus valley faith latter 900 ad brahmanism became powerful religious conversion indus valley convert brahmanism even majority retained original faith  The vedas make vague reference faith indus valley civilization The faith described vedas time line tells us people indus valley followed predominantly proto shaivism shaktism significant minority also adhered nature worship host gods goddesses There temples religious buildings religious ceremonies performed ceremonies performed houses outdoors
The vedic Aryans flush victory engaged rape plunder inhabitants indus valley inhabitants particularly hit nobility military commanders vedic Aryans ordered troops rape ordinary inhabitants indus valley documented vedas self orders disobeyed orders cover plunder result lot wealth plundered ordinary citizens

The nobility family members army indus valley empire got worst content death husbands fathers brothers slayed battle field put plunder rape It came back haunt pratipa vedic Aryan emperor content hostile populace king pratipa man incredible intelligence plunder going king emperor tried best ensure important members community affected thus traders merchants artisans religious official civil servants engineers safe merchandise traders protected act shrewed political calculation part pratipa ensured wins support prominent individuals essential running affairs dust settled 
The lands belonged indus valley nobility confiscated distributed prominent individuals Indo Aryan tribes happen prominent military commanders well  While lead feudalism land handed legal administrative powers new nobles liable pay taxes king emperor

The fate former noble families tragic many given away wives elites vedic Aryans rest became peasants working lands belonged noble families collaborated vedic Aryans spared 
The caste system follows
1 These new land magnets formed top caste society fact families held prominent military rank aswell vast tract land gave significant influence next king emperor family politics latter top caste would also include top civil servants empire super rich society usually trading community unusual individuals families given rank nobility
2 The next rank members military religious clergy latter members civil service belonging top rank men books science
3 The people third place traders  merchants metal smiths  tenants noble farmlands peasant proprietor crown lands
4 The labour class
5 The slaves
While details caste system dealt latter lets get back indus valley
King emperor pratipa knew revolt matter time began preparation meet revolt also began tàke steps reduce scale revolt

I born  raised elite locality Ahmedabad predominantly Hindu mix others time My first years spent ‘Shri Krishna Apartments’ 300odd Apartments Muslim family never became problem neighbour ever Our neighbours loved us loved Then 1992 grandparents’ home got burnt another mixed locality Ahmedabad right behind famed IIM Ahmedabad Some neighbours came joined loot told By time I also learnt greatgrandparents home old city Ahmedabad burnt good 56 times years Coming back immediate family 1992 neighbours still stood us people adjoining neighbourhood noticed Muslim began threatening parents leave place They would wait outside gate threaten us passed The builder Apartment  Kiran bhai stood us told us “Don’t worry I deal them” But things kept building A days later father driving car brought standstill thanks huge jam It turned BJPVHP workers stopped cars climbing windshield paint Swastik He obviously shit scared stayed calm waited turn arrive quietly got swastik painted car sped away like madman

On another scary night rumours growing riots brewing across Ahmedabad ran away family friend’s place He taught IIM Ahmedabad parents must’ve thought oncampushome would good place hide Somewhere midst conversation hosts loud noises seemed like large group people started coming distance My parents certain mob entered IIMA maybe they’d heard us hiding Our hosts obviously scared predicament put troubled parents Then host got idea said “Let dial watchman gate ask mob reached” When called watchman told noise Basketball match going IIMA Campus

Eventually things took decisive turn When returned home one night paper stuck door said something lines “Last warning Leave else” That reached doorstep last straw parents relented Still mother adamant want grow ghetto hence moved another mainstream locality near famed NID time Our lane mix Hindus Muslims time One first neighbours befriended lovely interreligious couple  Indian Architects studied Paris Their home similar Hindumajority locality attacked fled come new place

Although I four time things made aware Religion concept As I grew often I asked first introduction Arastu Are Parsi First I used say “No I’m Muslim” As I grew I would often lie “Yes I’m Parsi” Sometimes I would say “No I Hindu” A times I dared let “No I Muslim” I’d generally get second response “Oh You don’t look Muslim” Sometimes would response weird look face

But regardless whatever I said I never felt I belonged religion My family didn’t pray didn’t fast The time I would go mosque would father used take Eid mornings I’d look around rise kneel appear murmur copying whatever others around Post 1992 new Society moved gradually Hindus moved became Muslimonly lane So boys used gather pray fast stand outside mosque But never They’d bully time time although father’s hostility everyone also contributed I remember bullied even things wearing shorts “Maulana says shouldn’t wear shorts” they’d say “Maulana says shouldn’t watch TV” Sometimes Maulana nearby Madrasa used drive bicycle they’d abandon cricket match playing hide inside car parking waiting Maulana pass I’d one still standing wondering happened We two lovely dogs multiple complaints made since dogs drool considered unholy Islam I remember called ‘Kaafir’ much multiple times growing My relationship religion could best described ‘indifferent’

I remember two instances period One made rare visit one Muslim neighbour’s home daughter asked confirm rumours she’d heard “Tum namaz nahi padte” I said “Nahi” went “Tumhe pata hai na ke 2 Jumme Friday tak namaz na pade toh Musalman nahi rehte” My usually ultraaggressive father stunningly remained shut made awkward face Namaz nahi padhoge toh yeh hoga aisi saza milegi waisa gunaah chadega  Have heard umpteen times yearned someone tell good least expected tell pray gratitude fear one ever one time The second instance I got fight classmate School something Football ground He came pushed ground yelled “Saale miye ghar jala dunga tera” I remember first reaction ‘Shit others know I’m Muslim’ That fact considerably concealed otherwise name seemed secular deliberately mum insisted I kind name appearance accent didn’t betray signs matching stereotype people heads either

I dont remember seeing Muslim girl lane age around 1012 They either burkhas indoors I saw time weddings almost always faces heads would hidden I remember another instance time I addressed mother Mumma entire life times Mumma would get abbreviated Mu pronounced Mo Mother My school auto come pick I came mom waved goodbye I said Bye mu A Muslim automate laughed Yeh toh Hinduyo ki tarah mummy ko Maa bolta hai

Then around 1998 I remember one day I heard best friend’s parents’ general store burnt There riot city minor communal rumour somewhere one shop burnt I remember going rival’s store next door buy something next day As I stood shopowner speaking another man conversation went lines “You saw I did” “Ya I gave Kerosene” came reply

Sometime around I discovered one day father habit making powerful acquaintances communicating inland letters RSS chief K S Sudarshan He used keep letters whenever communal rumour flew around Those letters would help escape potential mob thought Sudarshan called us one night dinner RSS headquarter somewhere near Ahmedabad We escorted car time around 830 PM reached I remember walking past group 2030 stickwielding men Khaki chaddis practicing drills really scary child As walked Sudarshan seated sofa reasonably austere room 34 people sat around The first question asked “Aap ka ghar aur office kaha hai” dad replied two men got went room returning Till day suspicion none properties ever targetted something men noted night

This became something possibly helped us years later It around 430 PM 27th February 2002 I leave tuition class mother called office “Beta don’t go there’s news riot returning home” By I knew drill I cancelled plans stayed indoors I remember parents coming home soon us interrupted halfsleep night When woke next morning stepped outside groundfloor home I could see thick black smoke 23 sides One seemed quite close could father’s office building suspected next crossroads Soon heard neighbours every single Muslim establishment building burnt except father’s office Maybe note two men made night helped maybe wasn’t

The local TV Cable channels playing ‘Gadar’ day Soon neighbours began gathering entire lane Despite raised abusive father tension I felt moment fourteen year old new I scared life people suddenly wanted kill everyone name I born People around talking language I didn’t understand There talks could run lived direction people religion stayed neighbouring lanes I never felt aware surroundings Women children asked go terraces prepare kerosene bottles throw case mob attacked Some enterprising men said stand guard sides lane Mob aa bhi gaya toh yeh aadmi kya kar lene waala hai hushed response offer

I remember father trying brave walking one end lane evening He returned soon said saw slain BJP Leader Haren Pandya leading mob gathering crossroads outside It many years later father happened meet Mr Pandya told “Had I evening lane would burnt I trying pacify mob steer away” But seeing mob obviously scared father In meantime mother tried calling one family friend  A senior policeman Always past called similar situations immediately gotten police point set outside This time mother’s astonishment replied “Sorry time there’s nothing I do” My mother knew right different After 10 years time us run 

That interreligious couple first friends whole lane approached us saying one friends leads Police Academy lives Muslim ghetto Juhapura Ahmedabad offered host us farmhouse Then tried asking families lane wanted join space could arranged All said ‘No’ Some said worried black money jewellery etc homes said didnt want run didnt like father The police academy chief smart made watchmen outside home wear police clothes drive home police car We rode car escorted left home yet I remember seeing burning flame provision store owned Muslim uncle right outside lane I also remember seeing 23 mobs 45 men way trishuls hands wore saffron headbands Suddenly mystical area ‘Juhapura’ seemed saviour 

I never visited area ever As entered Juhapura I remember someone car saying “Yeh border hai hum aa gaye Juhapura” The relief I felt entering place I’d never still remains fresh mind

I remember next nights We stayed awake late night sitting host’s porch We could see burning yellow lights maybe flames hear loud noises chants mobs 23 kms away I discovered new practical laws Science The days would different Every black clouds smoke could seen distance it’d guessing game “Woh Cargo Motors jala hoga” “Woh soandso dukaan gayi hogi” course phone kept ringing Gujarati newspapers thing I remember one popular Gujarati daily photo terrace taken many terraces away seemed vague figure man wearing something white something hand following translated headline front page “Who gun wielding Muslim” We returned home week I enter door one nextdoor neighbours saw us screamed aloud “Lo bhagode aa gaye vapas” ‘See ran returned’

There damage done lane homes vandalized vicinity One belonged school friend classmate mine “One neighbours took TV” told much later A days returning I remember mother speaking familyfriend previous home  one fled 1992 She said scared lives even stopped going morning walks heard strong rumours trucks full Muslims coming burn Juhapura I think I almost laughed I also remember one night many months later father I opened door room mother sleeping woke startled stood started howling top voice She thought rioters came kill After pacifying eventually laughed years

Two memories stand additionally time It somewhere March 2002 I think We barely left home everything seemed gloomy time I got call school classmate mine inviting birthday party I couldnt understand frame mind I think couldnt understand mine The second memory relates yet another major change happened life My parents didnt feel comfortable sending beloved School anymore Hindu area Remember March final exam time close I 9th grade My father calls school administration understood gave promotion year For next academic year I moved another Jesuit school old city healthy Muslim population I asked several times I made strange move since school I left one everyone wanted go I often cooked different stories time

Soon parents began working riot relief camps I remember mother going camps quite often I NGO getting kids draw I remember one girl drawn red haired monster Soon dad revived old NGO took fulltime mother I remember one survey father got conducted pedestrians around Ahmedabad One questions “What think Juhapura area escaped Some answers “It’s miniPakistan” “There helipad helicopters Pakistan bring missiles war India” I also remember us stumbling upon pamphlets somewhere They claimed published VHPBajrang Dal text Gujarati read something lines These Muslim boys handsome fool take away Hindu girls later converting marrying Let us open Gyms beauty centers Hindu areas boys become handsome

Life moved Social activists began coming home film folk came lots activity An year later mom I finally left father Much later I discovered triggered high sense empowerment confidence within trodden upon long She told one visits relief camps woman came began howling “Aap educated Muslim aurat hai aap hamari haalat dekho aap hamari madad nahi karenge toh kaun karega” 

That moment liberated The pain 2002 pain woman gave strange sense empowerment She realized need bear anything pain wasnt largest could free could empower others could still happy life

Eventually joined iNGO soon started Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan Some may know name recent Haji Ali Triple Talaq cases I fifteen left father Life became shockingly kind ever since I got clutches It truly beautiful I wasn’t goodfornothing I made believe I skills I liked After ordeal lot acquaintances opened respective domestic issues I realized I wasn’t alone After period selfish enjoyment satiate sense deprived I became really passionate empowering young people started nonprofit We worked 6 years 6000 College youth educating issues Communalism Gender citizenship even happiness

I remember one time took group Hindu youth mainstream College Juhapura interaction 20 local girls On eve meeting lot parents warned “Are sure need go” “Be careful bad people stay there” Most still came still went That interaction amongst beautiful moments I ever experienced These folks connected girls many levels They laughing sharing anecdotes Those girls said never gone Juhapura youngsters shared problems seemed much like As left hugged invited respective social functions The walls broken least 1015 people taken evening I remember time I took group visit worsthit Naroda Patiya riotvictims Every single victim without exception said “Hindus aren’t problem There good bad people amongst This work politics politicians”

On opposite end I remember time grandfather came home one evening Although prided irreligious age long beard always traditional white kurtapyjama He told mother “Beta yeh NGO ka kaam toh thik hai par Arastu ko bol thoda deen religion ka bhi kaam karey” My mum replied “Papa aap ne jitna religion ka kaam apni zindagi mein kiya hai us se zyada isne itni umar mein NGO se kar liya hai” I also remember members Tablighi Jamaat would come home sometimes Their job propagate Islam despite knowing I never prayed fasted gone neighbourhood mosque kept coming trying patronize coming mosque I remember one particular line said elite member group “Aaj kal Musalman bachho ka dhyan bohot zyada Science aur Technology pe aa gaya hai Woh sab toh theek hai par deen religion pe dhyan pehle”

As time passed mother finally met kind loving man got married He happened Brahmin Hindu Interestingly devours Chicken mother loves Dosa On work front things moving decent pace I selected Indian delegate Workshop Bangkok first international trip I remember one time I walking fleamarket sudden cart full hanging ducks pigs came front I felt gross That entire trip remained struggle terms food A fierce nonvegetarian back home I struggled find simple chicken eat kinds animals I found creepy That moment whole Vegnonveg debate back home especially religious flavour given Gujarat took whole new turn head It nothing religion right wrong I realized habit

Soon Public Affairs Unit American Embassy backed NGO I leading Somewhere line selected International Visitor Leadership Program sent trip US We meeting Senators people UN US Govt met iNGOs Towards end trip I discovered introduction page given guests listed “2002 riot survivor working Muslim Youth preventing getting radicalized” Everyone nice I star It ‘positive discrimination’ But introduction couldn’t away truth I ‘riot survivor’ people lost people property I hadn’t And I wasn’t working ‘Muslim Youth preventing getting radicalized’ I fact going Colleges trying educate Hindu Youth communalism I remember telling American friend “I don’t think I made feel Muslim India I America” Towards end trip I remember calling mother America one night tell “Mum I’m done I’m leaving nonprofit world” “Whatever feel best Beta” replied

Moving I remember one thing ex mine used tell “Tu Muslim nahi hai Please Maine keh diya bas” It made comfortable think way Romantic relationships started lengthy discussions religion didnt start I also aware intense struggles await I also often told “…par tu waisa nahi hai” barrage insults Muslims I remember friend girlfriend’s asking planning outstation trip “Yaar go Muslim” I also remember time I event College students supposed dressed themes I wearing turquoise Kurta blue Jeans one student came asked Tumhare group ki theme AlQaeda hai kya Kurta pehena hai To day I feel uncomfortable wearing Kurta

By time life I knew I atheist Fiercely irrevocably atheist I remember trekking camp Manali cotravellers asked “Aap ka kya religion hai bhaiya” I said “Guess” They tried everything Hindu Muslim Christian Sikh Parsi Buddhist even Indian Human couldn’t guess ‘Atheist’ I let remain way I distinctly remember one returned Ahmedabad We got bus waiting parents come pick everyone A boy kept nagging “Bhaiya bolo na kya religion hai aap ka” I kept playing around avoiding Soon dad arrived As sat behind father scooter scooter sped away boy turned around screamed one last time “BHAIYAAAA BOLO NAA KYA ANSWER HAIIII”

Over years people family married Hindus Christians even Dalit I remember wearing Sikh kada wrist fascination I I kept tiny Buddha statue pocket times There idols Hindu gods home gifted gorgeous Madhubani artworks Hindu lords also stunningly beautiful Janamaz Muslims offer Namaz home I many temples life mosques simply saying No time Ive tourist visit new place Have accompanied people temples mosques asked would feel good said I didn’t mind

Later I startedup 2012 I founder 3 cofounders couldnt name office lease agreement wouldn’t allowed get place I To day lot Hindu friends Ahmedabad clue longlasting cemented phenomenon shock never ceases amaze Most 20 odd year olds today least Ahmedabad hardly ever interacted Muslims 1992 2002 ghettoization complete Muslims escaped forced leave live Muslims Hindus moved live Hindus Pull map Ahmedabad I show exactly lives wont countable exceptions And Ahmedabad cousin Bombay made product TV debates one hand rightwing trolling expressed tough get home religion 

I also remember time one cofounders warned friends “Be careful get business Miyabhai”
After 911 plus lots global terror attacks years Trump I sometimes told friends Hey sometimes wanted move Silicon Valley right Do think allowed Have several debates Muslim acquaintances online offline killing innocents name religion plainly wrong also harming Islam Islam isnt flawed practitioners common answer On political note Congress BJP often question put visible expectation saying former To line I read somewhere Facebook sums best Main Musalman hu Main marna nahi chahta Is liye filhaal main corruption se kaam chala lunga 

After 2002 Gaurav Yatras lot got thrown way made seem never happened I remember conversation Gujarati Hindu gentleman curious nonGujarati traveller train compartment I sharing back 2003 It necessary teach lesson Muslims They used kill Cows used convert daughters scared Haan yeh aurato aur bachho ke saath thoda zyada ho gaya par overall theek hi hua When gentleman seemed disagree went washroom guy told others Lagta hai Muslim hai

Somewhere around last year Triple Talaq struggle mother courageous colleagues fighting 10 years picked steam Their interactions tens thousands Muslim women across Country convinced damage propagated women name religion That even Quran  holy book consider reverent mention Triple Talaq added fervour fight 

In response hundreds Muslim men even women would attack mother colleagues events meetings TV debates WhatsApp messages broadcasted thousands atheist son Hindu husband Somewhere along way Prime Minister Modi ruling BJP climbed onto Triple Talaq bandwagon Now Muslims felt threatened mother colleagues got new weapon target “RSS Agent” Life took full turn made complete circle And sudden people felt threatened lives accused friends backers Soon political sloganeering posturing died struggle struggle continues keep Before writing post I called ask Mumma I write post relationship religion harm work Your thoughts absolutely shared fiercely openly dont ever worry replied instantaneously The day I decided drop fathers secularsounding surname use mothers first name last name I knew identity shall become lot visible small price pay respect I want give her

My latest tryst religion I went NotInMyName protest Jantar Mantar days back new employersfriends Several innocent people lynched name religion time reason used ‘Beef’ And days later terrorist attacks innocent Hindu pilgrims way Amarnath occurred I remember old familiar feeling coming back yet again

Who I fighting I hate they’re regardless name appearance mine solution even one one religion problem religions problem religion problem religion didn’t exist wouldn’t perpetrators create something else use

Who I belong I belong anyone Who I But interestingly answer questions clearest The others absolutely evade me

Most good friends today atheist irreligious scarred stories I remain observer religion account done far Let’s see offer dear Religion

Food,A long read definitely provides much food thought Would like know thoughts,1,fsagi8,dennkiesauros,6,"A comprehensive summary analysis Jaideep Varma 

If youre one cannot bear alternative opinion please dont burden dainty mind But youre fine wading fresh perspective pretensions last word might find constructed case worth time 

It seeks examine international overreaction Coronavirus entirely synch polarised world virus born 

Lets proceed factbyfact All stats public domain aggregated actually provide conservative estimate References first comment Ive tried simplify much I easy comprehension 

1 
The following fatality rates Coronavirus different agegroups 

09 yrs  0 1019 yrs  02 2029 yrs  02 
3039 yrs  02 4049 yrs  04 5059 yrs  14 
6070 yrs  38 7079 yrs  8 80 yrs  15 

So even infected person 80 years 85 chance survival It important understand Coronavirus affects mostly people preexisting conditions fatality rate really starts notably increasing agegroup 5059 

Also rumours men dying true proportion roughly 7030 Given respiratory disease discrepancy linked smoking experts specific targeting virus

2 
The following approximate outcome infected people 

95 infected people need 2 weeks recover medicine home 
5 need hospitalisation
2 need ICU
1 need ventilator

So vast majority infected people recover staying home medicine Even seemingly welleducated people dont seem grasp properly Please hold fact 

The big concern authorities large number cases 5 fewer hospital beds available especially 1 considerable shortage ventilators  

3 
In warmer countries reason still clear fatality rate considerably lower places far overall fatality rate 45 

Brazil 27 Malaysia 12 Thailand 04 Saudi Arabia 03 India 23 The two outliers Indonesia Philippines 84 67 experts stated figures emerged due low testing part world testing would lower fatality rates considerably 

Low testing big problem India well However reports people symptoms crowding hospitals many countries And important understand indeed many latent cases feared would actually bring DOWN fatality rate 

Death tallies cant faked hard hide dead  key number 20 tenodd days Even limited testing average number new Indian cases region 100120 day like week Which means absolutely evidence exponential community spread till date India And far case warm weather countries 

4 
In human history untreated illnesses unvaccinated viruses following fatality rates 

Rabies  99 AIDS 8090 EBOLA 87 Smallpox  65 BubonicPneumonic Plague 52 Tetanus 50 Cholera 47 TB 43 Chickenpox 30 Typhoid 15 SARS 11 Spanish Flu 10 Zika Virus 8 Yellow Fever 75 Diphtheria 75 Coronavirus 45 Measles 25 Swine Flu 21 

So Coronavirus among lowest fatality rates history

This first virus travel far 199 countries new world polarised ever human history social media mobile technology A global virus intensely globalised world surprise spreading peak travel season domestically China internationally The virus contagious viruses came great margin 

There many pandemics human history many far far worse one terms fatalities But reaction worldwide fraught anxiety panic face uncertainty cure yet 

Incidentally uncertainty condition people new world mobile social media deal far worse previous generation history  well documented discussed recent times Has greater say time pandemic 

5 
WHO estimates deaths arising common flu 290000 650000 people every year fatality rate roughly 1 Coronavirus killed 27000 far four months limited testing many parts world truer testing would lower 45 fatality rate considerably 

Also two recent studies done Italy comprehensively show less 1 deceased healthy persons persons without preexisting chronic diseases Which means face much focus Coronavirus clear many places died FROM Coronavirus died WITH Coronavirus 

Incidentally five winter seasons Italy 2013 2017 68000 deaths common flu That means average 4500 deaths month winter season February peak month This emphatically trend last decade Italy anyway  elderly people dying droves flu winter months Does Italys death toll approximately 9000 three months due Coronavirus seem high light Especially Italians sure many cases patients dying Coronavirus merely 

The US overtaken Italy number Coronavirus cases even sordid record comes common flu In 201728 flu season US registered 61000 deaths flu Thats average 10000 deaths month In 201819 flu season 34200 deaths  thats 5700 deaths month So far 1500 deaths Coronavirus US 

It worth repeating  Coronavirus killed 27000 four months average WHOs tally common flu deaths every year 39000 deaths PER MONTH critically within EXACTLY patient base And recent studies Italy found entirely clear many patients actually died Coronavirus 

This huge point doubt explored great depth medical fraternity months come But worth thinking  would happen intense 24hour media scrutiny worldwide common flu deaths  rate 39000 month worldwide  What would minds If discount absence uncertainty common flu prescribed cures fatality rate low would lead similar brand panic see This disproportionate panic apparent smallest things like despite WHO American Surgeon General categorically saying masks useless unless person definite symptoms frenzy 

Obviously case downplay Coronavirus pandemic It combatted key ways wellknown  social distancing regular handwashing quarantines closing travel A lockdown places signs community spreading definitely desirable Even precaution good option limited period   

Beyond dispensations politics worldwide frenzy alarmism accentuated mainstream media comprehensively leans towards worstcase scenarios name erring side safety And many people unable adjust mind fact worstcase scenarios experts fields even agree get stuck pessimistic often outlandish views credible one turn gets perpetuated It perfect pointer times many react violently singular view questioned alternative views derisively dismissed without facts examined This make one wonder climatechange alarmism well For example worth remembering William Nordhaus Economics Nobel 2018 climate change antialarmists equated climate deniers 

But heres kicker Why far higher death tallies flu recent years exactly patient group Coronavirus never got kind attention Coronavirus tallies received Could something largely modest economic social classes getting affected common flu And travelling jetsetting classes people affected Coronavirus Couple class consciousness blatant sacrificing worker class countries like India fear mongering political class relies subjugate masses time leadership standards around world alltime low ever human history lethal combination

Food,Finance Basics – Share MarketMutual fund Insurance,73,fxb9zh,vikashred,34,"Lets learn something home Any doubts message me

If earning  know put money  people put money 

The real thing – need invest It’s value everything buy like foodclothes land Everything rising one thing falling value money  It always fall That’s called inflation

So keeping money  declining around 6 percent every year

So people invest investment products see past years rising anything like fixed deposit gold mutual fund share market

We discuss share market mutual fund insurance below

1 Share Market –
I google search company called reliance  showed share price 

Just search google  reliance share price

At time search showed 1353 per share value Market cap see  858Trillion  So divide mkt capvalue per share You know total many shares Share means part company So company might keep 51 share giving rest public buy means selling ownership company part get money So use money may clear debt expand

Company list share NSEBSE National Stock ExchangeBombay Stock Exchange They offer people lesser price first known IPO Initial public Offering  So subscribe broker allotment done

The broker register NSEBSE open account broker buy sell share You buy IPO buy already listed share exchange allow sell buy share among individual shares hold demat account Demat account basically deposit account share like bank account money You open demat account broker And trading simple buy button buy sell button sell

For example zerodha India’s largest share broker 




They discount brokers means charge less trading like least india 



2 Mutual Fund 
Mutual fund giving someone money rights manage funds So different varities funds chose one fund manager would like give money to

They different types

i Equity Mutual fund

Equity mutual fund buy shares  different types like one investing small cap shares one large mix both
There index funds index means instrument sums share market growthdecline For example top 50 shares index called Nifty 50
A index fund track nifty 50 requirement fund managers

If someone managing fund much harder effort charge money that’s called expense ratio So nifty fund expense ratio lowest

ii Debt fund
Debt fund doesnot directly invest shares  invest Government bonds  company schemes FD So safest

iii There Hybrid funds means mix funds

For suggestion rating agency like Morning star  invest 5 star rated funds

There various direct mutual fund apps available charge less expense ratio Like link provided zerodha share market section Once open account use their coinzerodhacom to trade mutual funds It’s free direct
You sign use app buy It’s easy

You may heard terms like lumpsum SIP Lumpsum basically investing amount SIP means investing montly basis So SIP averages investment  It means april  bought high price may market fell still bought SIP buy price average both



3 Insurance 
Insurance means transfer risk  Sothere companies transfer risk vehiclehealth life basically financiallyAccordingly classified two types

i General insurance
General insurance relates bike carsetc It also different types like

First party – first party means insured person one accident paid

Third party means one accident paid
These compulsory india

ii Life insurance

Life insurance health insurance term insurance endowment plans etc

a Health Insurance
Health insurance means covers hospital expenses like got disease bill amount lakhs rupees could drain investment right So health insurancethe company covers expense

b Term Insurance
Term insurance means like earning member family die one support  So giving premium 6000 per year die family get lumpsum 60 lakh  like that…

But death benefit else won’t get money

c Endowment Plans

If giving 50000 premium 5 years getting 5 lakh 10 years depends market

Or die nominee gets 5 lakh  Endowment example like this

You get maturity benefit death benefit premiums high

Basically I believe dont need endowment better invest mutual fund take term insurance  since endowment huge charges  Health insurance must though",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxb9zh/finance_basics_share_marketmutual_fund_insurance/

The difference becomes even stark one compares contributions achievements Ashkenazi Jews American Israeli Indians A persecuted minority millions contributed many orders compared Indias privileged academic contributors say Tamil Brahmins Of course worse compared Indians whole What striking difference holds true even comparing different field like business finance contrasting Gujrati Marwaris

Socrates father Western thought often spoke concept called Thumos Thumos much Greek concept An abstract concept held many meanings translations However concept lost humanity literal translation exists English The essence ‘Thumos’ probably summed saying – “When making decision man faced two choices An easy path tough path The easy path leads barbarism The tough civilization And tough road every society must traverse reach peak Taking tougher road informed decision natural impulse every man take easy path He consciously take tougher path avoid easy However man might unknowingly go easy path end want Retracing steps back tougher path often thankless sometimes nigh impossible task Most men make India cross roads today And might make it

It indeed ironic I started essay decline ‘Indian civilization’ concept borrowed West This show Indian philosophy reached high levels thought concept merely show far strayed Make mistake For Vedas ultimate repository Indian philosophy written long long Socrates’ ancestors even took plough decided grow weeds observed wild gave nourishment We reached unimaginable highs fallen highs long Socrates even first coherent thought All Socrates rediscover already known We superior respects And attitude lies seed destruction How many times heard elders say – “Indian culture best Anything associated West bad” I hear time It constant din ears Anything associated West decadent immoral inferior And Indian culture superior every culture past present future Well superior exactly manner Few gave concrete answer question If gave answer all

The common response question anger rebuke asking many questions How superior IF superior Let us look around world today ask “How many concepts ideas objects I use daily life daytoday basis emerged purely indigenous sources” I asked question many times The conclusion everytime None To clarify point let us look last invention consequence purely Oriental origin Gunpowder And taken advanced West If Chinese invented Gunpowder West developed cannons used Indeed nothing call truly except past And us seen revere past It drummed us schools universities families dinner table Indian culture always miles ahead decadent corrupt influences West It This assertion nothing inferiority complex And aversion truth

It important realize I saying India Indian culture inferior developed civilization fabrication It fabrication We indeed highly advanced civilization highly cultured one But What mish mash cultures know headed

How fall low How reached highs even dreamt fall depths highs unimaginable It tempting blame West colonialism British rule But problem lies much deeper that

Every empire built one strength One strength sets apart neighbours allows grow others around stagnate The Roman empire built discipline Legions Most armies time little unruly mobs proverbial discipline Roman Legion made formidable attacking force The British Empire built strength trade links Britain small insignificant island vast territorial holdings every corner planet The dominant empire today USA This empire little different For strength stems culture Right Hollywood sitcoms thought processes ideas even eat wear cultural power USA full show Every empire history one strength And India cultural empire similar USA today A thousand years ago students flocked world study Nalanda Taxila Just flock USA today Great ideas born crucible free thought Religions philosophies sciences established enlightened souls Just established USA today However empires must fall The Roman empire fell discipline legions eroded The British empire fell trade links could longer kept captive serve alone The cultural empire USA ripe fall even I write And Indian empire already fallen A thousand years ago India USA age Not Today cultural empire eroded left kind cultural hubris And hubris know fine quality Often found perish it

The strength Indian civilization always openness new ideas And willingness put hard work ideas Today however neither openness new ideas work hard Take example resistance ‘Westernization’ Does speak reluctance embrace new ideas concepts This hardening opinions closing minds prevalent resisting outside influences ‘preserving Indian culture’ also every detail lives A teacher India like student questions For question lies seed new idea And seed lies implication teacher may wrong And Indians like someone asks many questions I found cost I questioned India’s supposed cultural superiority

A far dangerous symptom however instinctive reluctance work hard want Our instinctive impulse take shortcut Our instinctive reflex take easy road Here I come back opening statement essay “The easy path leads barbarism The tough civilization” The tough road often tedious path And India road often avoided favour easy Jugaad It nothing shortcut And nation nay civilization become addicted shortcuts And hence fallen Everything India resolved shortcut If stand queue always tout happy help jump line fee Instead paying taxes far easier hide income bed Why wait light change red green one crossing path Why orderly disorderly get away Why work hard steal someone Why polite Why throw garbage dustbin someone collect spot city I could go Everything India shortcut And culture taking shortcuts struck root mindset society Every single thing shortcut Jugaad Why take tougher road civilization Why apply minds someone else It easier run away West stay back make country worth living Why perform original research India build apparatus hop across pond perform research West apparatus bought shelf Why Why indeed Because short cut It easy path And shall lead us barbarism It individual failing part Indians I blame one person It failing society Indeed historical inevitability

Historical inevitability Yes decline inevitable Every great civilization declined culture openness replaced closed minds aversion questions Look Islam thousand year ago today If anyone dares interpret quoran way accepted dogma immediately met fatwa calling beheading Western civilization flourished prospered precisely cast yoke Catholic church allowed free thought This freedom thought remain India vestiges And already seen gradually eroded It historical inevitability The point clarified study entropy Entropy layman’s terms measure disorderliness system In spontaneous process Entropy always increases So consider human history spontaneous process interspersed periods Man consciously tried improve difficult see every rise followed fall As I already stated taking tougher road informed decision easy path comes spontaneously Every civilization point abandon long tough road take short cut And society starts taking shortcuts begins decline Every civilization declined shall we

And declined Our fall begun And shall keep falling long long time Is nothing done I know The thing done administration shock treatment A shock treatment drastically affects us forced change better The Black Death 14th century jolted Europe gave rise Renaissance laid foundation current dominance Western civilization Kemal Mustafa Ataturk’s radical measures Westernization suppression anything connected decadence Ottoman empire gave rise Modern Turkey A nation beacon hope Muslim world What kind shock treatment reverse tide India’s decline I know But least acknowledge problem And see problem scale give shock treatment

TLDR  We decline culture lost ability question innovate We also prefer shortcuts It historical inevitability nothing",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d931fb/india_is_not_as_people_keep_calling_it_an/

Business/Finance,What fuck modi ,4,fmob0d,UsualEducation,5,"What fuck modi  Hes unfit leader country 

He always touts horns representing india elevating world largest democracy 

Now  Worlds largest democracy economy probably ruins time 

As far I gathered 

Hes really giving people financial support He urged people leave disadvantaged behind I understand But dude even people paying income stream left 

So maybe pay employees Will landlord generous enough forget monthly payments Maybe even pay property tax without income stream

Hes providing tax cuts financing salaries people 

Now shit storm doesnt even policies place decides full lockdown Many business become bankrupt Many company dissolved It period unstable financial turmoil Many lifes ruined fucker still accountable action  like erection 3000 crore statue  rather inaction 

This could well lead another event like Great Depression Without support government many people laid many become bankrupt Industrial activities delayed demands greatly reduced due depletion peoples cash reserves",https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fmob0d/what_the_fuck_is_modi_doing/

My dad retired 2 years back government organization pension scheme He saved 25L years sustain 

He thoughts opening playschool wanted something education Noble idea Yes But background educationteaching etc understanding schools run More importantly problem dadunfortunately lacks business acumen trusting people 

He tried franchise one company signed contract lost 1L company refused return This done without much consultation I could least tried look prevent Next aligned another school took franchise spent 8L till date running significant loss 

I also 2 elder brothers supportive terms finance else We living different cities Mumbai I Delhi parents UP My sisterinlaw step school coordinator initially found teaching gig right step imo elsewhere soonafter Year date 5 children 2 teachers mostly sit whole day My dad acts school coordinator 


Current situation

Lately argues open school home using part building rented School run rented building He also expects support financially despite multitude warnings ignoring number suggestions I made etc To put cherry cake I came across profile experienced School coordinator I suggested dad lead rejected Muslim wasnt something I expected dadbut thats another story

My concern stems fact deep hole dad sinking terms expenses This worrying I started job 2 years back expect itd least 34 years I position I help bit Additionally current tenant pretty good  offers recurring cashflow terms savings

Call pessimist I believe BJP actually benefiting CAANRC protests Call paranoid I think Modi Shah use chaos nation justify even fascist measures

Fascism relies dichotomy ‘us them’ ‘We’ caste Hindus led strong patriarch versus Muslims really Pakistani infiltrators andor terrorists dirty conniving subhumans want destroy Hindustan Christians lot Dalits ‘belong’ Hindus taking away Hindu college seats jobs leading country shit cleaning shit

This Hindutva hatred ignorance masquerading political philosophy Not socialism social democracy liberalism conservatism hate These philosophies whatever merits demerits may take effort dedication love subject study Hindutva requires hate Forget Hindu texts don’t even study Constitution Doing takes effort see Hating lynching far easier

This saffrontoting goons stop Muslims one unforgettable instancehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvQJfvp59Kufs Kanhaiya Kumar force chant “Jai Shree Ram” Amit Shah dehumanizes Bangladeshi migrants “termites” Narendra Modi says protesters recognized clothes

Why abrogation Article 370 blackout human rights violations Kashmir abnormal Modia focus Pakistan Ram Mandir NRC CAA The message clear Muslims Indians cannot stay India Hindu Rashtra

But Preamble What happened ‘sovereign socialist secular democratic republic’ What Article 14 Article 15 Our Fundamental Rights

Okay maybe aren’t ‘socialist’ ‘secular’ anymore But young age reading hearing words “Unity diversity” “United stand divided fall” “India world’s largest democracy” “We secular country” “Indians known hospitality”

From youth Idea India ingrained us And Hindutva  hatred really  attacked core Indianness

The fight today don’t want persecuted religious minorities seek India That’s absurd We hospitable people

We fight 14 percent Indians face religious persecution country We fight economy going hatred rise ruling party done nothing fix either Instead trying alienate crores Indians making detention centres least 25 people already diedhttpswwwdeccanheraldcomnationalnationalpolitics25declaredforeignersdiedinassamdetentioncentre750773html 31 Jul ’19 set police armed forces peaceful protesters leading death least 20 people 22 Dec ’19 Their fantasy project cost us lakhs croreshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqlTKGzTvJk pay NRC CAA detention centres And 20 people died 18 initial days protests may looking hundreds even thousands deaths within next year alone

If think BJP good nation disagree definition ‘good’

And certainly disagree definition ‘nation’ Hindu Rashtra Hindu nationalism violate Constitution And turning India theocracy like Iran Modi Shah Sangh Parivar machinery wants Can Modi say oath want convert India Hindu Rashtra Can bhakts say so

Business/Finance,The impact GST invoicing thus revenue profit organizations operating India  exploring one factors impacting economy right,78,d4mq0p,zaplinaki,46,"tldr

Because GST organizations bill clients state involved GST norms If GST required one bill means multiple bills depending number states involved It could go high 36 bills 29 states  7 union territories This means preGST X effort required make 100 rupees requires nX effort 1 36 make 100 rupees Meaning work required make amount money increased 100 3500 

This impacted profit companies thus economy

Before I begin I expert taxation  I business guy working B2B sales Indian MNC My 35 year career largely postGST I experienced preGST era well I constantly deal GST numerous requirements

My objective highlight major roadblock I many business folks encountered due GST I feel aspect playing big role slowdown time left largely unexplored till grassroot nature problem The people higher dont encounter directly anyone doesnt encounter wouldnt understand gravity problem aka reporters etc Again reiterate I trying debate improvements VAT I merely highlight side GST hindering revenue profit thus business

x200B

Lets start basic concepts first

1 Invoicing The act giving bill products services utilized customer For people simple receipt end meal instance checkout counter clothing store clothes youve purchased bill given cleaning service cleaning homes

But organization invoice means collect money client Anything sold client generate invoice products deliveredservices rendered The invoice also tax details GST number billing address registered address shipping address list items need paid applicable tax  CGST IGST SGST payment due date authorized signatures

An invoice means collect cash client Without proper invoice cash cannot collected This problem starts Since proper invoice gives lot ground client delay payment

x200B

2 The process Invoicing  Invoicing function organization Once product delivered services rendered sometimes delivered invoicing triggered meaning bill generated money collected client This usually done ERP like SAP Oracle The invoice reaches collections department collection manager submits invoice client verification payment The collection managers front line people tasked bringing money organization They one important people running business performance impacts cash flow organization

They normally tagged accounts aka clients One collection manager could handling anywhere one client thousands depending nature size clients

Once client verifies invoice money transferred selling organization becomes revenue subsequently profit them

If client holds invoice reason becomes lost revenue bad debt loss selling organization The longer client holds money lesser value money holds due concept timevalue money 100 rupees today considered money 100 rupees one month due timevalue money Thus delayed payment impacts profitability organization

3 GST services industry GST dictates invoicing services done state services delivered I explain concept detail crux problem To start I outline simple sale sale would translate preGST postGST era

Problem Statement Assume Tata Motors intend buy 5000 chairs offices Pepperfry 50 lakh rupees Tata Motors also wants Pepperfry install chairs offices 5 lakh rupees provide 5 years warranty including checkup every year determine life chair repairs required 15 lakh rupees Tata Motors wants chairs delivered 50 offices india across 20 different states This mix products chairs  services installation maintenance The total bill 70 lakh rupees 

5000 Chairs  INR 50 Lakhs

Installation Chairs 50 Offices across 20 states  INR 5 Lakhs

Maintenance Chairs 5 years  INR 15 Lakhs

Pepperfry sales executives take purchase order Tata Motors put order system The input purcahse order trigger three functions

a Delivery products  services

b Invoicing payment order

c PostSale service  maintenance

PreGST Invoicing

Before GST came picture bill would generated Pepperfry single bill centrally ie would generate bill 70 lakhs extra relevant VAT tax details two organizations This would ONE SINGLE BILL entire deal irrespective state city etc They would give Tata Motors one single piece paper saying owed 70 lakhs due date payment

Manoj Pepperfrys collection manager Tata Motors submit single invoice Tata Motors office checked Tata Motors procurement finance teams nothing wrong invoice payment cleared due date

Again point focus ONE INVOICE needed delivery chairs services entire country Manoj submit one invoice follow invoice collect payment one invoice Tata Motors teams verify one invoice process payment one invoice Only one tax number billing address needed invoice done CENTRALLY

If something wrong invoice Manoj correct one invoice resubmit Tata Motors

x200B

PostGST Invoicing

Like I mentioned GST dictates invoicing done state services delivered ie separate GST filing states Explaining means separate invoice generated state involved transaction If one state involved one invoice If two states involved two invoices If five states involved five invoices And case since twenty states involved twenty invoices

x200B

The values invoices split direct proportion usage If 100 rs total bill value three states Maharashtra UP  Kerala 603010 usage bills be

Maharashtra  60

UP  30

Kerala  10

So sense separate company state terms GST

Moving implication Tata Motors  Pepperfry transaction

Since chairs delivered 20 states Tata Motors  Pepperfry registered office twenty states along GST number state Tata Motors issue 20 purchase orders proportionate value Pepperfry ie 70 lakhs split proportionally 20 states The sales executive enter twenty purchase orders system Then deliveries triggered 20 states 20 different invoices handed Manoj generation

Manoj submit 20 invoices Pepperfry whose procurement department verify 20 invoices give finance verify initiate 20 payments Then 20 payments received Tata Motors 20 banking transaction IDs Manoj verify 20 payments close transaction This ideal scenario

As might able tell effort required everyone involved deal gone 20 times This effort required one state involved buying side ie Maharastra selling Maharashtra Itll twice effort two states involved buying side ie Maharashtra selling UP  Kerala It possibility going upto 36 time effort required previously amount money since 29 states 7 Union Territories Yes Union Territories treated separately well

x200B

The impact is

1 EfficiencyEffort Pepperfry still going make 70 lakhs deal effort required twenty times Tata Motors give 20 purchase orders 20 invoices generated The time taken process invoices value impact time taken collect money This invoice template  values different Example

Maharashtra

Chairs  INR 5 Lakhs

Installation  INR 50K

Support  INR 15 Lakhs

Kerala

Chairs  INR 3 Lakhs

Installation  INR 30K

Support  INR 90K

UP

Chairs  INR 10 Lakhs

Installation  INR 1 Lakh

Support  INR 3 Lakhs

The total money collected sales executive Manoj procurement guy  finance guy 20 times work added value

Their efficiency scenario gone 5 arguably go 27 states union territories involved although rare case

Also like I said ideal scenario It doesnt always go smoothly Some challenges encountered are

a Incorrect proportions purchase orders  invoices Someone made mistake 10 needed allocated UP theyve allocated 11 15 The process repeated finding fault

b Incorrect GST PO  invoice Suppose particular invoice wrong GST means cant processed incorrect tax information means money cant collected invoice Before GST would one wrong tax number could one two twenty Mistakes happen real life This one common things face Mistakes happened GST well happen multiples And really cant expect people make mistakes always Again efficiency goes multiple times effort required fix mistakes

c Missing GST It isnt necessary companies GST registration every state So Tata Motors might registered office 2 states example ie wont GST number They provide declaration Pepperfry saying dont GST number two states Pepperfry able give invoice The payment money delayed till Getting declaration experience takes long time Tata Motors says arent able claim input tax credit state Thats like leaving money table  getting declaration basically saying willing lose money transaction requires approvals upto highest levels loss company Manoj follow two time consuming things get amount money thus efficiency goes further

2 Cash Flow Cash lifeline company A company without cash cannot survive They could valued billion dollars dont cash pay employees shut Kingfisher couldnt pay employees interest vendors didnt cash left Jet  doesnt cash payment salaries fuel loan payments etc BSNL struggling pay things dont cash

Thus healthy cash flow one important aspects business survival company If companies people cash flow would oxygen Invoicing cash brought company

Because decrease efficiency collection managers delay introduced collection cash So preGST cash collected 25 days would taking say 45 days collection managers efficiency gone down

And tiny delays add Incorrect GST  add another 7 days cash collected missing GST  add 15 days etc

This two outcomes

Firstly Pepperfry earlier predicted theyll get money 30 days receiving 45 days means 70 lakhs need 30th day daily expenses needs found somewhere else since 70 days coming another 2 weeks They dip reserves 15 days

Secondly money lost value It 70 lakhs end 30 days since time passed lost value due time value money It couldve generated interest couldve invested delayed hence value lost This loss Pepperfry

To summarize GST delayed payment cycle company It takes longer collect amount money used GST introduced If money takes longer come takes longer go  salaries interest payments vendor payments outflows impacted

3 Profit The profit made deal varies company company deal deal Let us assume Pepperfry made 10 profit deal ie 7 lakhs Due following factors profit get impacted

a The payment cycle delayed theyre collecting profit longer duration They collect 63 lakhs start making profit This could say theyve collected 13 20 invoices The remaining 7 give profit So basically profit generation delayed cash flow delayed This means profit made deal lost value If preGST 7 lakhs itll less 7 lakhs value due time value money And efficiency gone effort required generate amount profit gone thus profit deal actually gone down

b There 20 invoices process Not always go Many get stuck payment delayed may never come due process issues The money linger never come Pepperfry become bad debt If invoice gets stuck reason like incorrect GST missing GST incorrect value cash wont collected invoice amount get reduced profit So invoice hasnt gotten processed 7 lakhs profit less say 5 lakhs If 7 lakhs collected deal Pepperfry actually make loss deal

The biggest culprits PSUs like HPCL BPCL UBI etc Their requirements stringent single mistake hold invoice This payment could get delayed years thus profit deal impacted They wont pay till everything invoice correct could delay multiple reasons Many businesses dont sell PSUs reason  profits cash get stuck business them

This different preGST earlier say mistake one invoice fix Now could many For amount revenue chances wont make amount profit

Thus due lowered efficiency longer payment cycle stuck payments profit made gotten impacted

x200B

In conclusion ramblings due statespecific nature GST effort required make amount money preGST era gone This impacted revenue thus profit made companies problems everyone face GST If want business multiple states ready face challenges

Feel free discuss impact economy In opinion big impact I really need someone much knowledgeable analyze publish I feel deserves conversation least one change impacted revenue profit extensively made making money harder thus going lasting impact economy The worst part doesnt look like system going change near future

What planned US15 billion Saudi investment petroleumrelated Indian businesses controversial boxing championship common



Both reflect world power economics drive policy politics business expense fundamental rights



And underscore emerging new world order might right jungle dissenters minorities others increasingly cornered repressed



Rather furthering stability building inclusive cohesive societies support trends likely produce evermore unstable insecure world marked societal strife mass migration radicalization violence



A world business capitalizes decisions critical mass world leaders share autocratic authoritarian illiberal principles governance often reward lucrative business deals policies potentially aggravate rather reduce conflict



No doubt planned acquisition Saudi Arabia’s stateowned national oil company Aramco 20 percent petroleumrelated businesses Reliance Industries one India’s biggest companies makes commercial strategic economic business sense



Yet equally little doubt announcement acquisition read Indian prime minister Narendra Modi days scrapped autonomous status troubled majority Muslim region Kashmir license pursue Hindu nationalist policies discriminate Muslims minorities fuel tensions Pakistan subcontinent’s nuclear power



The ultimate cost fallout policies business deals contribute give license exclusion rather inclusion segments population aggravate regional conflict could far higher benefits accrued parties deal



Underscoring risk exclusionary policies unilateral moves cross border skirmishes Indian Pakistani forces erupted week along Kashmiri frontier least five people killed



The timing announcement Aramco Reliance deal global environment various forms racism prejudice including Islamophobia rise assures Indian political business leaders unlikely pay immediate price policies sow discord risk loss life



Like case Saudi Muslim acquiescence China’s brutal clampdown Turkic Muslims troubled northwestern Chinese province Xinjiang frontal assault faith recent history announcement risks convincing embattled Muslim minorities like Uighurs Kashmiris Myanmar’s Rohingya lingering refugee camps Bangladesh hung dry



To sure Kashmiris count support Pakistan likely little emotional verbal political



Pakistan unlikely risk blacklisting Financial Action Task Force FATF international antimoney laundering terrorism finance watchdog next scheduled meeting October unleashing antiIndian militants



Anthony Joshua’s controversial fight Andy Ruiz scheduled December Saudi Arabia first boxing championship held Middle East pales terms geopolitical societal impact compared Saudi Indian business deal



Fact Saudi Arabia’s hosting championship provoked ire activists rather significant population groups The fight furthermore likely seen evidence strengthening Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s selective efforts socially liberalize austere kingdom



Nonetheless also reinforces Prince Mohammed’s justified perception Saudi Arabia get away imprisoning activists argued favour reforms well lack transparency judicial proceedings alleged perpetrators killing journalist Jamal Khashoggi Saudi consulate Istanbul Saudi Arabia insists killing perpetrated rogue operatives



What Saudi investment India scheduled boxing championship kingdom common confirm norms world ‘humane authority’ concept developed prominent Chinese international relations scholar Yan Xuetong rare quantity



Mr Yan employs concept argue without referring President Xi Jinping Xinjiang China’s aggressive approach towards South China Sea policy towards Taiwan Hong Kong China lacks humane authority capitalize US President Donald J Trump’s undermining US leadership



Mr Yan defines state humane authority maintaining strategic credibility defending international order becoming example adherence international norms rewarding states live norms punishing states violate Garnering humane authority enables state win allies build stable international order



Mr Yan’s analysis applicable India Saudi Arabia China others tend towards civilizational policies like United States Russia Hungary Turkey



It equally true men like Anthony Joshua promoter Eddie Hearn business leaders general



To sure Aramco stateowned subject government policy Nonetheless prepares likely world’s largest initial public offering even Aramco take factors beyond pure economic financial criteria account



At end day consequence Mr Yan’s theory leadership whether geopolitical economic business defined much power opportunity degrees morality ethics



Failure embrace notion humane authority reducing leadership business decisions exploiting opportunity disregard consequences environment taken likely ultimately haunt political business leaders alike



Said Mr Yan “Since leadership humane authority able rectify states disturb international order order based leadership durably maintained”

What true political leaders also true business leaders even refuse acknowledge decisions much political economic impact

Business/Finance,So made little bit money huh How nice,26,9ypjsr,DexterMilburn,11," So made little bit money huh How nice
nbsp

All life youve ever wanted little bit money And congratulations Does feel nice Does feel like dream come true Of course doesnt Its numbers screen staring like pathetic joke But thanks thankless job made little bit money How nice

And halfdecayed intelligence decided want invest little bit money youve made Well step right raging wildfire field investing Weve got shitshow full stocks mutual funds bonds real estate gold commodities clamouring attention even money Done properly retire ungodly amount wealth And done poorly join majority investors setting cash fire day day 

But dont feel daunted scared Youre right path thats probably time youre going hear words life Just fact youre thinking investing money puts major advantage fact youve even made little bit money extremely rare Look around see People poor theyre crawling tents roadside people douchebags theyre buying worthless bling like fur sweaters gold chains people childish absolutely buy latest iPhone credit cards people dumb cant bothered learn investing Just fact youre thinking investing makes part exclusive club

Before get ahead feel one cent happiness better let tell something  theres army twats waiting screw little bit money youve made army twats wants take away thing matters miserable existence anymore These crooked relationship managers wholl sell anything get commissions These unsuspecting relatives wholl recommend terrible investments dont know better These seedy stock brokers wholl push schemes offering incredibly high returns good true These corrupt financial advisors wholl destroy returns either theyre incompetent unscrupulous Youve got entire armada twats waiting snatch money right wallet Whatre going Are going put head hand cash Are going run mommy like little bitch No youre going pull knife stab little twat right heart And heres beginning set basic guidelines 

nbsp
 Savings sexy
Lets honest never made stuff gave wet dreams women Well heres chance You know girls like days Its ripped chest sleak jawline Its man saves Step aside AXE body spray theres new sheriff town If youre spending youre earning youve got bigger problems worry Before anything else need make sure youre bringing money youre spending So reign spending delay gratification That burger going taste pretty much without overpriced slice cheese And movie probably Netflix months

nbsp
 Debt kryptonite
So borrowed little bit money stuck interest payments Thats okay hasnt done dumb stuff young full hormones I know I This one time I cleaned entire jar mayonnaise thinking yogurt Set money aside every month pay monthly minimum loans little prepay debts Some loans take priority others pay credit cards personal loans similar highinterest debt first Keep mind loans straight poison help develop assets like home loan increase future income like education loan business loan alright However investing carrying high amount debt like playing football one leg tied behind back Not exactly ideal

nbsp
 Read like life depends it
Stop reading WhatsApp forwards pick book pick another one If dont develop habit reading properly youre going get lot poop flinged business But make book every get read fling poop n00bs You dont go straight finance section Begin book sounds interesting work way Reading helps understand world around also develops better personality temperament within Most patience memory goldfish generally speaking goldfishes good investors

nbsp
 Gold old
Gold housewives 70s stockpiled cupboard option But child 20th century You actually know turn wifi You better options like mutual funds No matter uncle third cousin says investing gold setting cash fire All make feel good inside eternal fireplace fuelled cash keeps burning background Gold silver metals dig ground As investment sit stare Just shine doesnt mean theyre good investments However everyone convinced basic guideline So youre hell bent investing gold I recommend going mountains throwing tall cliff A mediumsized one works too

nbsp
 Insurance  Investing
While housewives 70s gold housewives 80s LIC Getting life insurance critical family depends income insurance investing like pizza pineapple never mix well Have ever wondered insurance company collecting premium money Well company invests premium money stocks bonds also mutual funds So let insurance people insure let investing people invest Separation labour something caveman figured 2nd century Its time evolved caveman

nbsp
 Real estate real investing
The reason buy property youre going living Buying real estate purely investment one worst decisions could ever make Real estate illiquid market need wait find buyer seller high transaction costs stamp duty bullshit charges lot red tape needs several government approvals faces high maintenance costs occasional cost paint plumbing However every Tom Dick Harry tell real estate great investment Why Because real estate Indians signal wealth others It Indians demand respect chaar log committee Its tell people weve got big dick afraid swing around You dont big dick Tuck little stinker back pants Youre embarrassing yourself

nbsp
 Pick poison properly
Identifying bad investments greater skill identifying good investments Now gold real estate vilified bad investments lets turn places actually deserve money  mutual funds For uninitiated includes idiots mutual fund collects money invests stock market behalf A diversified basket stocks good quality companies outperform investments time period longer 10 years Mutual funds give diversified basket stocks If havent living rock past years youve probably see advertising campaign  Mutual Funds Sahi Hai And living rock stay Were great without you

nbsp
 Get coma
The best investors ones win game longterm always patience When youre investing stocks mutual funds need minimum time horizon 5 years Any less come fireplaces fuelled cash Mentally need place stock market might run cliff screaming wind tomorrow morning youll still continue investing per plan youre thinking long term This ensures emotions influenced ups downs stock market dont get way Ideally want invest immediately get coma Trust one notice youre gone Youre one person world seven billion people Youre really insignificant larger scheme Illuminati

nbsp
 Dont watch CNBC
All life youve made socially acceptable choices crave validation people around To repitillian brain approval strangers feels better orgasm But comes investing never seek validation choices especially pundits CNBC Televised business news focuses shortest short terms need keep eye longest long terms Yes important keep tabs current events far better sources information nightly news I recommend reading Livemint Reuters news Those two outfits pay endorse PR people reading give call I accept cash cheques PayTM Fuck Ill even take bitcoin

nbsp
 Keep It Simple Shithead
Here basic plan use money get paid every month First take care loans paying hungry bankers come demanding pound flesh Pay credit cards full time Now estimate much youre going need monthly bills  includes everything electric bill tab local bar Deduct amount invest rest money When comes investing begin putting three months monthly expenses liquid mutual fund This emergency cash stash Next depending time horizon risk appetite select combination 38 mutual funds There different types mutual funds heres handy rule thumb navigate them
 
                                     High time horizon              Low time horizon  

 Low risk appetite  Largecap equity funds      Debt mutual funds  
 High risk appetite Midsmallmulticap equity fundsDebt mutual funds  
 
When youre done set SIPs dont transfers manually month Every year take time review process

nbsp

This basic plan require tweaking depending context life But plan important financial life also rest life In back mind youve always known But never followed making plan life series mistakes regrets Is drink much 

The lords literature require I write conclusion piece But end This beginning investing journey The basic guidelines mentioned intended serve starting point research These guidelines rocket science supposed complicated A person average intelligence awareness reasonably expect understand follow The question person average intelligence awareness Assuming enough read statistics require half admit youre dumb rock

Always keep eye armada twats try convince investing rocket science simply charge high fees lure unprofitable investments Done poorly expect midlife crisis magnified bonfire cash Done properly create kind wealth benefit well future generations Youve already disappointed parents Dont disappoint children now

Business/Finance,Suddenly ‘one nation one policy’ sentiment overtaking models Interview YV Reddy IAS former RBI Governor 14th Finance Commission Chairman,6,azoh6g,Avinash_Sharma,3,"You said book feeling quarters cooperative federalism replaced coercive federalism What basis comment

Some developments taken place 14th Finance Commission’s FC recommendations Cesses surcharge increased significantly even GST The States felt shortchanged way Centrally Sponsored Schemes CSS restructured increasing share State government put way GST administered The general debate earlier Bihar model competing Gujarat model different States’ models development competing other

Now suddenly “one nation one policy” sentiment overtaking models And Planning Commission forum States also now

Due institutional vacuum Ministries directly dealing CSS So spirit discussion dialogue replaced diktats various Ministries Some say dialogue untypical cooperative federalism

You’ve said States forced share resources CSS After 14th FC recommendations impression Centre devolving States went 32 42

As coauthor GR Reddy explain comparison 32 42 39 became 42 way computations differed This increase offset actions cesses surcharges CSS So virtually advantage States

GR Reddy The 14th FC considered entire revenue account Unlike previous FCs considered even Plan revenue account As result Plan transfers subsumed tax devolution

The difference 14th FC others former away sector specific grants amount 45 total devolution If take two together actual devolution would 39 earlier became 42 Even 3 increase visible neutralised Centre The reality increased matching contribution States CSS done away 6000 model schools started 2011 half way 201516 took decision terminate entire scheme model schools

The entire burden running schools meeting expenditure – capital operational expenditure fallen States

They restructured 66 CSS 22 umbrella schemes So change number CSS schemes All components remained same

Why didn’t States raise issue

We done 15Th FC… communicated Centre done correct

Immediately 14th FC recommendations accepted Hon Prime Minister wrote us saying ‘now States flush funds…’ We wrote back saying absolutely increase flow funds States change composition transfers favour untied transfers Now happened qualitative change transfers States – getting money untied transfers

The total transfers percentage gross revenues States Centre remained level – 49

Aren’t untied transfers desirable It frees States use funds whatever purpose deem fit…

Whatever additional money come untied transfers tied towards meeting additional commitment

In revised pattern CSS put money

You made commitment can’t ‘uncommit’ But changed pattern Whatever untied funds got put schemes

For example 2014 Telangana’s contribution CSS around ₹2000 crore In 201516 change funding patterns gone ₹3500 crore So additional commitment part States

There commitment States termination CSS – model schools scheme example Another BRGF – backward regions grant fund  Telangana State 9 10 districts BRGF They substantially reduced allocations women child welfare also

There view many CSS – money efficiently used

The concern CSS money thinly spread across schemes For example take education health States spending close 80 The Centre supplementing States 20 make much difference That comes conditionalities submission uses visits Central teams delays release funds As result procedures unable fully utilise Centre’s allocations I don’t think State used funds Centre entirely

So solution offer funds allow States free hand

The Commission Dr Reddy recommended – number CSS restricted nationally identified priorities

Dr YV Reddy Basic issue Finance Commission one mechanism essentially meant sharing taxes based formula 8090 transfers States always tax devolution In tax devolution conditions much weight give population census’ population consideration namely fiscal capacity The question weight give If give weight equally efficiency equity cancel sense

You mentioned institutional vacuum Do think NITI Aayog able step plate

There deficiencies way Planning Commission functioned There impression given States go Commission supplicant discussion That weakness corrected In correction process bad habit got rid new system There forum Each Ministry become authority unto able dictate terms States

Is deliberate Aayog power evolve thus

That question mark Whether design default result individual Ministries indicating States means coherent comprehensive view States process

There view terms reference 15th FC may stand test constitutional validity What’s view

There 34 issues It true generated unprecedented reaction Never FC number CMs got together protested Also scholars questioned constitutional validity Terms Reference – example whether need revenue deficit

The constitution provides FC needs decide Third 15th FC asked review 14th FC It continuing process Above Commission asked make recommendations keeping view performance indicators States conform certain policy parameters reflected existing policy Centre

The way FC structured supposed instrument central government’s priorities day So questioned several grounds

Most considerations mentioned ToR necessarily binding FC The Commission choose choose take account But needs courage vision Commission – hoping there

What’s view controversy base date population census 15th FC

The whole question whether correct thing It difficult defend outdated population basis Because FC supposed take account needs State period How 1971 population determine needs State 2021 It undertaken grounds States penalised But States taken action family planning 1971 They don’t get anything It continuing incentive right

This time prescribed 2011 population That also valid The FC recommendations 2020 So estimated population States period 20202025 Ideally stipulation date population left FC one population relevant period

Isn’t GST good example cooperative fiscal federalism

It extraordinary institution commendable It come existence overnight It started informal committee Finance Ministry evolved In implementation dissatisfaction expressed The fact Centre veto increases influence But part game Concerns may way working But institutional set extraordinarily good It good example collaboration cooperation institution Union States

Can replicated areas

Exactly This revenue side On expenditure side fiscal transfers outside FC brought interState council That recommendation 14th FC

The GST Council may replicated good approach build On expenditure side different type collaboration compared revenue side

Is recommendation 15th FC give

Yes The transfers States Centre take FC nonFC routes The 14th FC gave recommendations structure nonFC transfers It’s ambit advice

There three approaches virtually abolish Commission making constitutional amendment say percentage second continuous FC GST Council type mechanism FC gets subsumed third FC design new institutional arrangements technical political consensusbased recommended 14th FC

All provoked partly GST Council positive partly institutional vacuum — pushing us find new institutional mechanisms

Pleasantly surprised functioning GST Council It comprises people varying vote bank compulsions

The consensus result number years effort Consultative process going last 1015 years States also convinced winwin situation sake tax harmonisation across country felt better And also feeling GST better form tax leading better compliance It builds value chain Initially apprehension part manufacturing States may lose destination tax So put place 2 year statutory mechanism compensated period 5 years The states yielded lot space Centre For States VAT constituted 60 old tax revenue They conceded 50 fiscal space Centre whereas space conceded Centre 30 They still get customs duty income tax etc In working still trust deficit voting pattern fully loaded favour Centre almost veto power

Then way GST administered also raising apprehensions minds people treated fairly Centre Like delays apportionment IGST delays payment compensation cess collecting compensation cess required Best thing reduce compensation cess correspondingly So surplus compensation cess lying Centre distributed 5 years It Centre set record straight remove trust deficit

On special category status Andhra Pradesh stand took 14th FC

Special category status jurisdiction FC In book I explained Centre’s version relationship 14th FC recommendation special category

If want simple truth 14th FC make recommendation inclusion exclusion special category The issue according special category status assurance PM given months 14th FC could give recommendations

But government explanation interprets recommendations 14th FC regard special category status I given book It reader decide related

Cess becoming monster administrative system With GST assumed cess won’t longer part system But Kerala disaster cess Isn’t purpose reform lost acts

There calamity fund Centre expected come assistance states things happen always burden sharing can’t anticipate Now recourse cess things unusual

Isnt step away cooperative fiscal federalism The Council telling one state funds needed rebuilding disaster generated within State

That dissenting calling coercive federalism These ‘innovations’ States uncomfortable with

You Kerala upper end social development scale Uttarakhand lower end TN Gujarat Maharashtra higher end economic development index Odisha Bihar How possible central body including FC reconcile differences

That exactly issue regard federation In federation competing considerations You build trust amongst therefore fixed formula That’s operate system

What needed Centre able bring together States treat inequalities calamities national problem Union States participate Problem whenever State opposes Centre accused antinational Being antiunion antinational

There 3 levels debate – State interest Union interest national interest To build national consensus Union States must together If States get feeling Union abrogated sole authority national interest States resent That essence matter

How much strong leader top

You go back Constituent Assembly debates Dr Ambedkar introducing draft constitution discusses merits demerits parliamentary presidential form government says parliamentary system important India He says India essentially undemocratic therefore emphasises continuous accountability He says continuous accountability important stability That deliberate choice type issue

In 14th FC recommended forest cover determinant In five years lapsed studied recommendation helped India’s environment cause

No But it’s interesting area see impact recommendation But logic simple – forest cover The state govt contributing environment cost It cannot use resource maintain So provide The basic principle externalities The state contributing cost – gain anything It incurs cost maintain forest

Business/Finance,TLDR – Godman Tycoon – The Untold Story Baba Ramdev,546,6s4hoh,rahultheinvader,95,"Context – Yesterday thread I happened mention reading book redditors suggested TLDR book I finished 

On onset time resources I would highly recommend reading book It’s published Juggernaut available reading app Rs 80 I read biographies often go either way This one good biographies I read partly due Caravan Magazine style free flow writing rather meandering author’s perceptions also subject Baba Ramdev fascinating intriguing person It took three days essentially three sittings complete The author – Priyanka Pathak Narain journalist used cover religion spirituality section Mint begins journey As part book interviewed 52 subjects including Balakrishna – Ramdev’s deputy owner 94 shares Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd 

So go

 Baba Ramdev Ram Kisan Yadav born Said Alipur poor farming family A sickly child rather became obese victim father’s frequent violent outbursts 

 Somewhere early 20s finds band Arya Samaj workers immediately drawn He joined Khanpur gurukul learnt Sanskrit grammar tended cows collected alms met future deputytobe Acharya Balakrishna

 Balakrishna quite Ayurveda Haridwar befriends Acharya Karamveer – stoic soft spoken Arya Samaj member three post graduate degrees Yoga Indian Philosophy Vedas Karamveer soon takes Balakrishna wing soon Ramdev joins controversy

 Ramdev learns yoga Karamveer To propagate Yoga masses soon take ownership Shankar Dev patron Kripalu Bagh Ashram Haridwar Shankar Dev wants trusts Karamveer But since Arya Samaj member ready take Sanyas Sensing opportunity Ramdev steps Taking Sanyas means two things   1 He can’t keep formal relations family 2 He cannot maintain material wealth I bringing course important

 Balakrishna meanwhile sets Divya Pharmacy using license silent partner Swami Yogananda Balakrishna Nepal legal cases still courst forging high school documents attain passport

 In early 2000s Aastha Sanskar become household name The TV guys select Ramdev Karamveer  saffron robes means authenticity An interesting story Aastha turned Ramdev diligent Baba went Sanskar paying Rs 1 Lakh twenty minute slot This also I learnt channels like Sanskar Aastha don’t earn advertising godmen paying TV slots demonstrate abilities

 We know story Ramdev becomes household name nauli kriya churning stomach also personality selfdepreciating humor showmanship 

 Soon Ramdev friends high places Mulayam Singh ND Tiwari Congress Sudarshan Agarwal – ex UP governor So charged Sales Tax fraud Sudarshan Agarwal mounts immense pressure Sales Tax Deputy Commissioner drop case retire

 Ramdev soon brings extended family takes business His younger brother Ram Bharat soon charge finances This causes rift Karamveer Ramdev Afterall Ramdev shouldn’t familial relations So one day Karamveer walks 

 Swami Yogananda whose license enabled setting Divya Pharmacy falling Soon mysteriously knifed death The neighbors cagey case goes unsolved 

 Enter Rajeev Dixit  A swadeshi founder Azadi Bachao Andolan Ramdev’s interest entering politics leads two becoming incredibly close much discomfort Balakrishna Ram Bharat

 Meanwhile political favors Congress masters reap reward wins contracts Food Processing Plants But soon due paying workers Divya Pharmacy minimum wage draw ire CITU Brinda Karat soon claims workers brought ‘testicles sort wildcat’ Apparently told deer horns human skulls crushed medicines Though proof validate samples tested Union Health Ministries’ Ayurvedic unit – AYUSH confirmed traces human animal DNA Karat apparently met ND Tiwari according minister didn’t budge take action

 Soon Ramdev starts roadshows across country abroad Patanjali Ayurved Ltd born controversial Divya Pharmacy And see next mystery The disappearance 77 year old TB infested Shankar Mahadev Ramdev’s Guru Mahadev becoming quite vocal anxious venture Ramdev deputies Police find nothing note room saying “I taken loan trust I cannot pay Please forgive I leaving” Ramdev foreign trip didn’t cut short would expected 

 Ramdev Rajeev Dixit set new party – Bharat Swabhiman Andolan 

 The Takeover Aastha – When SEBI freezes 93 Aastha’s owners share sensing opportunity Ramdev moves buys remaining 7 10 crores installment The installments never paid ownership transferred Ramdev Part done faith Once formalities done confrontational meeting Ramdev bullies owner MD resignation Meanwhile asks another follower buy Sanskar channel Which follower did

 As mentioned earlier keeping inline Ramdev’s political ambitions Rajeev Dixit Ramdev became increasingly close much dismay Balakrishna Ram Bharat Soon Rajeev Dixit found dead locked bathroom The hospital said cardiac arrest Ramdev said television told Rajeev take care health diabetes BP heart disease But Rajeev’s brother Pradeep says health problems Next Ramdev convinces family conduct funeral Haridwar Dixit son soil instead native Wardha But body laid public demonstration Bharat Swabhiman Andolan workers stunned Dixit’s face unrecognizable strange purple blue His skin peeling strangely There black blue blood coming nose Soon hue cry The Andolan workers wanted conduct post mortem Ramdev called personal meeting confiscated phones checked pens cameras told post mortem Hindu Dharma When refused budge Ramdev agreed soon went back hall ahead workers spoke microphone ‘Some people come Mumbai They want post mortem Such cutting Hindu Dharma’ Soon Ramdev’s men got body ready set cremation ghats

 Ramdev’s biggest fall came participation Anna movement He wanted use movement political mileage Hence original protesters focused stronger Lokpal bill Ramdev bringing black money back So sat fast onto death protest Meanwhile backdoor meeting senior Congress members Pranab Mukerjee PK Bansal Kapil Sibal Subodh Kant Sahay He agreed something went ahead exact opposite This ired Congress midnight cops swooped protestors lathi charge Ramdev course famously tried escape dressed white salwar kameez

 Part credit towards success Patanjali go exCEO – SK Patra He helped lay foundations setup best practices highly disoriented company ethics standard operating procedures Patra also used connections stabilize witchhunting Ramdev’s business enterprises Congress Govt But soon Patra’s influence made Balakrishna Ram Bharat uneasy Patra let ugly confrontation Baba 

 Today Patanjali second largest FMCG company revenue Rs 10561 crores Its best selling products ghee – Rs 1467 crore Dant Kanti toothpaste – Rs 940 crore But Patanjali ghee isn’t normal ghee actually white butter really good health Caravan published transcript book section  Linkhttpwwwcaravanmagazineinvantagepatanjalisdesicowgheeevencowghee

 Part reason Patanjali’s market share price Its market Baba believes taking marginal share But also possible working Patanjali considered seva asking increments privileges frowned upon Economic Times published transcript book section – Linkhttpeconomictimesindiatimescomindustryconsproductsfmcginsidepatanjalihereswhatlifeislikeinbabaramdevscompanyarticleshow59824892cms 

 There number violations flagged FSSAI Food Safety Standards Authority India including license number fraudulence Patanjali noodles A lot third party agencies written poor conditions lack hygiene production units

Ramdev businessman politician godman rolled one He doubt helped popularize Yoga Ayurveda India The people speak author doubt captivated influenced doubt bullied His close association BJP government today means none open cases would move anytime soon His target get Patanjali 20000 crores 201819 And environment nationalistic swadeshi assertions well might 

Finally I realise TLDR post needs TLDR But quite hard summarizing book without loosing intricacies Hence would recommend reading book

India How rich nation became poor rich again

Essays  March 19 2007  1238

Developing Cultures  Case Studies coedited Peter Berger Laurence Harrison Routledge 2005

Does culture way help explain fact Indian economy stagnating first fifty years 20th century began grow respectable clip 1980 amongst fastest growing world end century

Consider following hundred year trend 1900 1950 Indian economy grew average 08 percent year population also grew rate thus net growth income per capita nil rightly called colonial economy stagnant After Independence economic growth picked 35 percent 1950 1980 population growth 22 percent hence net affect income 13 percent per capita mournfully referred “the Hindu rate growth” Things began change modest liberalization eighties annual economic growth rose 56 percent This happy trend continued reform decade nineties growth averaged 62 percent year population slowed 18 percent thus per capita income rose decent 44 percent year

As benchmark recall Wests industrial revolution took place 3 percent GDP growth 11 percent per capita income growth 1820 To appreciate magnitude Indian change 1980 let illustrate If Indias per capita GDP continued growing pre1980 level income would reached present American capita income levels 2250 continues grow post1980 rate reach levels 2066 gain 184 years

How one begin explain Indias economic performance past hundred years The Indian nationalist blames first fifty years stagnation British colonialism But trade economist counter showing world economy also stagnant first half 20th century especially World War I world per capita GDP grew annually one percent2 The main culprits would say conflict autarky Disgraceful protectionism governments Wars slowed world Indian economy

Although Indian economy picked 1950 neoclassical economist would argue performed world economy experienced “golden age” driven trade expansion 1971 Like rest Third World India benefit global trade expansion closed economy pursued import substitution Moreover Nehrus socialism shackled economy fierce controls private sector pejoratively called Licence Raj hence annual GDP growth 15 percentage points even Third World average 1950 19803

This changed dramatically modest liberal reforms 1980s sweeping ones 1990s Indian economy integrated world In twenty years outperformed world economy significantly amongst fastest world4 Thus gradual technological diffusion rising capital accumulation productivity gradual education expansion help economists explain good deal story There also value time accumulated learning time “Collective learning” Hayeks term applied cumulative experience generations build embodied language technology way things5

But economic explanations enough That India adopted democracy 1950 capitalism 1991 also significant democracys redistributive pressures free power farmers subsidies dampened growth also explain Indias reform process painfully slow Economists also find puzzling liberal institutions British Raj engender faster growth colonial years The rule law relative peace Pax Brittanica nondirigiste administration railways canals—all market friendly moves all

I believe national confidence also plays important role The damaging impact colonialism may well Indian minds—it created inferiority complex recently recovered Douglass North rightly emphasized importance beliefs6Businessmen understand value confidence entrepreneurial success creating climate investment Historians emphasize power selfbelief national successRoman history Britains rise 19th century examples After Independence Indias confidence certainly rose especially democracy took root flawed economic institutions Nehruvian socialism damaged confidence Once socialist institutions began replaced capitalist ones Reform period confidence returned young Indian minds finally became decolonized I traveled extensively across India 1990s I discovered changed mood I think also explains current economic success7

I shall amplify arguments taking reader galloping tour Indian economic history From story I shall draw lessons role institutions culture development En passant I shall touch upon great questions Indian history British impoverish India Why didnt railways engender industrial revolution Did Nehrus socialism dampen Indias progress What consequence democracy preceding capitalism

Lets begin Mughals

Indias nationalist historians portrayed precolonial economy golden age prosperity fabulous wealth set Europeans great voyages discovery8 During Mughal Empire end 16th century Indias wealth indeed sustain 100 million people With plenty arable land agriculture certainly productive Western Europes even subsistenceoriented peasant got decent return9 India also large skilled workforce produced cotton also luxuries aristocracy Consequently economy produced large financial surplus used support growing Mughal Empire finance spectacular monuments like Taj Mahal10

In 1497 Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama flotilla four ships find Indias wealth But twoyear voyage commercial success Indians interested European clothes goods made far ones India But Da Gama told King Manuel Portugal large cities large buildings rivers great populations He spoke spices jewels precious stones “mines gold” He believed found Indias legendary wealth11

It took English hundred years discover wealth Initially came plunder soon discovered rewards trade They found India produced worlds best cotton yarn textiles enormous quantities12 What Indians wanted exchange Europeans gold silver insatiable appetite Hence constant flow gold India absorbed good deal bullion mined Spaniards New World Having learned cotton textiles India English turned tables brought industrial revolution Britain destroyed lives millions Indian weavers

India leading manufacturer 18th century

India leading manufacturing country world early 18th century It 226 percent share worlds GDP came around 16 percent 1820 closer share world population13 It developed banking system vigorous merchant capital network agents brokers middlemen Given enormous financial surplus skilled artisan class large exports plenty arable land reasonable productivity question didnt modern industrial economy emerge India Instead India become impoverished

Despite dynamic growing commercial sector responded market forces extensive foreign trade truth 18th century India significantly behind Western Europe technology institutions ideas Neither agricultural revolution scientific revolution occurred long run manual skill Indian artisan could substitute technological progress”14 and would needed new attitudes Notwithstanding surplus trade mideighteenth India “per capita product perhaps twothirds England France”15

There easy answer problem country prosperous people poor One explanation even 18th century India large population plenty cheap labor Prosperity comes rising productivity rise productivity depends technology When supply labor elastic economical hire people invest machines Hence Englishman observed 1807 “In India seldom attempt made accomplish anything machinery performed human labour”16 There easy answer problem country prosperous people poor One explanation even 18 century India large population plenty cheap labor Prosperity comes rising productivity rise productivity depends technology When supply labor elastic economical hire people invest machines Hence Englishman observed 1807 “In India seldom attempt made accomplish anything machinery performed human labour”

Did British Raj impoverish India

Indias nationalist historians blamed British Raj Indias poverty The classic nationalist case India rich British came colonialism weakened agriculture “deindustrialized” India throwing millions artisans work Britains trade policies encouraged import manufactures export raw materials finally drained wealth India transferring capital Britain

Nationalists claimed Lancashires new textile mills crushed Indias handloom textile industry threw millions weavers work Indias textile exports plunged leadership position start Britains Industrial Revolution fraction The indigenous banking system financed exports also destroyed Since colonial government erect tariff barriers Indian consumers shifted cheaper English millmade cloth millions handloom workers left misery British colonial rule “deindustrialised” India favorite nationalist phrase exporter textiles India became exporter raw cotton17

Britain also changed old land revenue system disadvantage farmer pay revenue whether monsoon failed This led famines The worst one 189697 affected 96 million lives killed estimated 5 million people Although railways helped trade food crops enlarged national market sucked away peasants surplus earlier stored bad years Moreover British government transferred surplus revenues back England Since India consistently exported imported second half 19th century early 20th century Britain used Indias trade surplus finance trade deficit rest world pay exports India capital repayments London This represented massive drain Indias wealth18

In recent years historians challenged nationalist picture They argued Indian industrys decline 19th century caused technology The machines Britains industrial revolution wiped Indian textiles way traditional handmade textiles disappeared Europe rest world Fifty years later Indian textile mills would destroyed Indias weavers thus victims technological obsolescence19

They also found land tax exorbitant—by 1900 5 percent agricultural output half average per capita tax burden There “drain wealth” 15 percent GNP every year The revisionist historians argued Indias payments Britain real military civilian services service capital investments Also overhead cost British establishment—the called “home charges”—was fact quite small20 If India army navy would spent True India balance payments surplus Britain used finance part deficit India compensated import gold silver went private Indian hands

India begins reindustrize

Indian entrepreneurs began set modern textile mills 1850 slowly began recapture domestic market In 1896 Indian mills supplied 8 total cloth consumed India 1913 20 1936 62 1945 7621Although India participate global trade expansion 1870 1913 Indian businessmen made large profits First World War reinvested war Thus Indias manufacturing output grew 56 percent per year 191338 well world average 33 percent” 22 The British government finally provided tariff protection 1920s helped industrialists expand diversify

By Independence 1947 Indian entrepreneurs strong position buy businesses departing British Industrys share Indias GNP doubled 38 percent 1913 75 percent 1947 share manufactures exports rose 224 percent 1913 30 percent 1947

Why didnt industrial revolution occur

One intriguing questions history India failed create industrial revolution Karl Marx predicted railways would transform India usher industrial revolution Indeed First World War thought ready takeoff By 1914 India third largest railway network worlds largest jute manufacturing industry fourth largest cotton textile industry largest canal system 25 percent world trade23Although colony liberal regulatory regimefar investor friendly one replaced Independence—and 1920s infant industry also favored tariffs It merchant class hungry become industrialists Industrialization fact pick War industrys share national output doubled But enough broadly transform agricultural society Modern industry employed 25 million people population 350 million

Amiya Kumar Bagchi Marxist economist suggests reason lack effective demand colonial period limited business opportunity Indians poor buy modern goods services24 If domestic Indian market small couldnt entrepreneur supplemented producing export Morris D Morris blames supply constraints25 An Indian entrepreneur uncompetitive shortage technology skilled labor capital—all raised cost production The historian Rajat Ray argues Indian businessmen export made inferior products unacceptable world market In view technological backwardness single biggest failing26 But surely could imported technology Jamshedji Tata GD Birla others did

Unlike nationalist historians I think British conspiracy deliberately underinvest India sabotage Indian business interests Bombays textile mills built credit technical assistance machines Britain although competitive threat Manchesters mills I believe industrial revolution occur Indian agriculture remained stagnant cannot industrial revolution without agricultural surplus means feed rapidly growing urban population second international trading environment turned hostile protectionism First World War followed Depression third colonial government educate masses unlike Japanese state finally colonial mindset pervaded Indian middle classeven hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence politically enslaved

What verdict British rule

Did British impoverish India There question 18th century plundered looted Indias wealth conquerors done history But create ongoing institutions Indias detriment This nature theory colonialism True Industrial Revolution threw millions weavers work would happened way new technology reached India British government policy could cushioned impact erecting trade barriers saved enormous amount human suffering protecting handlooms would temporary palliative

Odd may seem I believe Britain “exploit” India enough Had made massive investments India Americas India would become prosperous much bigger market British goods A richer India would better customer better supplier firmer basis Empire27 Britains main failure educate Indian masses—hence 83 percent Indians illiterate Independence Britains education system India produced thin upper crust extremely well educated Indians masses remained illiterate28

Although Britain could lift Indians poverty avert famines give India institutions democracythe rule law independent judiciary free press It built railways canals harbors It gave India almost hundred years peace—the Pax Britannica Although gave modern values institutions interfere ancient traditions religion Hence India preserved spiritual heritage old way life continues Many despair divisiveness caste hold Indian way life also bulwark onslaught global culture

Independence License Raj

After Independence democracy took root India gradually masses acquired stake system periodically electing representatives even lowest castes The rulers also adopted Fabian socialist economic path Indians turn capitalism 1991 although modest liberalization economy 1980s Thus India embraced democracy capitalism makes journey modernity unique explains good deal

Jawaharlal Nehru planners trust private entrepreneurs made state entrepreneur surprisingly failed create industrial revolution Instead India experienced agricultural revolution early 1970s It thus important precondition industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but industrial takeoff eluded Its investment rate also rose 6 percent well 20 per cent yet engender takeoff Why

I think least six things wrong Indias mantra one adopted inwardlooking importsubstituting path rather outwardlooking exportpromoting route thus denied share world trade prosperity trade brought postWar era Two set massive inefficient monopolistic public sector denied autonomy working hence investments productive poor capitaloutput ratio Three overregulated private enterprise worst controls world diminished competition market four discouraged foreign capital denied benefits technology world class competition Five pampered organized labor point extremely low productivity Six ignored education children

Nehrus strategic planner PC Mahalanobis made two wrong assumptions He assumed opportunities rapid export expansion 1950s turned wrong India discovered tiny Hong Kong could earn exports whole India Indias share world trade declined 22 percent 1947 05 percent 1990 He also assumed competition wasteful also flawed idea little improvement productivity without it

Even damaging creeping controls private sector The bizarre licensing system It began Industrial Licensing Act 1951 required entrepreneur get license set new unit expand change product mix A huge number untrained clerks engineers bureaucrats Directorate General Technical Development operating basis inadequate information vetted thousands applications ad hoc basis These low level functionaries took months futile microreview application finally sent approval administrative ministry The ministry lost months reviewing data sent application interministerial licensing committee After Ministers approval investor seek approval import machinery capital goods licensing committee If finance needed State financial institution scrutiny repeated afresh The result enormous delays sometimes lasting years staggering opportunities corruption

Large business houses set parallel bureaucracies Delhi follow files organize bribes win licenses If entrepreneur finally get started made success enterprise trouble It offence punishable law manufacture beyond capacity granted license India became country world production sorely needed goods sorely punishable law29

The system ended thwarting competition entrepreneurship growth without achieving social objectives It fostered monopolies proliferated uneconomicsize plants remote uncompetitive locations employing secondrate technology Bureaucrats clue basics running business made decisions choice technology size location plants

Although becoming clear India wrong path late sixties instead changing course Nehru Indira Gandhi introduced controls She nationalized banks discouraged foreign investment placed hurdles domestic enterprise Hence industrial growth plunged 77 per cent year 19511965 40 per cent 19661980 Productivity Indian manufacturing declined half percent year 1960 198530

“19661980 effectively dark period Indian economy”31 It harder blame Nehru adopting economic wrong model socialism wisdom age dozens economists visited India hailed bold experiment32 It right blame Indira Gandhi Japans miracle evident Korea Taiwan following footsteps However ideology one part story An important reason nonperformance poor implementation Even Nehrus socialism could delivered degenerate “License Raj”

India Reforms

Although modest liberalization 1980s decisive turning point came July 1991 minority government Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms It opened economy foreign investment trade dismantled import controls lowered customs duties devalued currency made rupee convertible trade account virtually abolished licensing controls private investment dropped tax rates broke public sector monopolies As result growth rose 75 percent year three years row midnineties inflation came 13 percent 6 percent 1993 exchange reserves shot 1 billion 20 billion 1993 crossed 100 billion end 2003 This important turning point Dengs revolution China December 1978 Surprisingly elected coalition governments succeeded Rao continued reform process despite slow incremental pace made India one fastest growing major economies world33

Indians traditionally accorded high place making money Hence merchant bania placed third fourcaste hierarchy behind brahmin kshatriya step ahead laboring shudra After economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable sons brahmins kshatriyas began get MBAs wanted become entrepreneurs The business pages newspapers became livelier chief ministers states scrambled private investment judges became evenhanded industrial disputes As result India midst social revolution rivalled perhaps ascent Japans merchant class 1968 Meiji Restoration

There also mental revolution And changed attitude English illustrates new mindset Ever since British left Indians constantly carped English language But 1990s carping seemed die quietly without ceremony English became one Indian languages English lost colonial stigma oddly enough around time Hindu nationalists came power Young Indians new middle class think English skill like Windows This Hinglish Hindi mixed English spreading Encouraged flourishing private television channels supported advertisers newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace uninhibited hybrid Hindi English popular idiom bazaar rushing socioeconomic ladder The purists naturally disapprove people comfortable accepting today Indians relaxed confident people Their minds become decolonized

The world meanwhile also changed industrial information economy seemed speak Indias advantage symbolized success software business process outsourcing These “Bangalores” given Indians confidence reflect new social contract The new entrepreneurs inherit wealth risen back talent hard work professional skills A new selfbelief emerged among urban youth doesnt need approval others especially West Music composers like AR Rehman display exuberant nonchalance new young Bollywood pop stars So new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy designers fashion clothes beauty queens cricket stars

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains great deal Indian economy stagnating first half 20th century went become one fastest growing end century It tells us example disgraceful protectionism governments interwar years first half 20th century dampened world trade slowed world Indian economies It also explains India performed world average 19501980 thinking trade impoverished colonial period India closed economy denied fruits “golden period” world trade 1950 1970 “License Raj” institutions Nehrus socialism also suppressed growth Finally neoclassical economics explains dismantling controls integrating economy global economy Indian economy become competitive growing rapidly reforms

But whole story must turn institutions attitudes understand incentive structure Indian society60 Indians blame colonialism impoverishing But seen colonialism complex tale For example deindustrialize India nationalists argued handloom textiles died India world technological obsolescence Colonialisms bigger damage loss Indian confidence inhibited Indian entrepreneurs This confidence began grow Gandhis freedom movement first half 20th century industrialization pick However impact society insufficient create industrial revolution

After Independence Indias confidence certainly rose democracy took root flawed economic institutions Nehruvian socialism acted damper Once socialist institutions began replaced capitalist ones Reform period selfassurance returned Indian marketplace Todays mood India opposite existed hundred years ago Insecurity inferiority filled colonial India apparent writings Bengali writers 19th century Bankim Chandra Chatterji Today writers like Salman Rushdie Arundhati Roy exhibit matter fact assuredness almost cool reflection changed national mindset

India embraced democracy first capitalism afterwards made difference India became fullfledged democracy 1950 universal suffrage extensive human rights 1991 opened free play market forces For rest world way around In West suffrage extended gradually last century mass political parties developed democracy began impinge capitalist institutions practices

Indias democracy overwhelming majority poor voters70 per cent still live rural areas organized labor constitutes less 10 per cent total labor middle class around 20 per cent population Because democratic pressures India tried redistribute pie baked It set intricate regulatory networks private economy transformed rural industrial society It began think terms “welfare” welfaregenerating jobs The result seen throttling enterprise slow growth missed opportunities It price India paid democracy capitalism—or rather much democracy enough capitalism

Since politics short run game growth long run one never situation completely optimal This explains Indian politicians bother education results take long time come When politician promises rice two rupees kilo costs five rupees market wins election Since mid1960s politicians vigorously competed giving away free goods services voters When politicians money come creating schools improving old ones Indias damaging fiscal deficit around 10 percent GDP center states combined testimonial downside competitive politics teaches demand publicly provided goods services insatiable democracy

But Indias problems governance go far beyond need appease interests The weakening democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi 1970s caused widespread corruption political violence populist giveaways paralysis problem solving Conspicuously absent disciplined party organizations help leaders democracies mobilize support specific programs Hence excessive reliance personal appeal individual leaders win elections When power leaders tend take easy way act all

Will capitalism cousin globalization succeed establishing comfortable place India The answer depends ability deliver prosperity broadly It also depends leaders government business champion classic liberal premises free trade competition It needs leaders come say 1 people fare well competitive market place 2 winners far outnumber losers 2 capitalist democracy best arrangement found 4 globalization good thing great leap forward history My fear capitalisms success India threatened much leftists protectionists timidity defenders

The curious historic inversion democracy capitalism means Indias path future evolving daily dialogue conservative forces caste religion village leftist Nehruvian socialist forces dominated intellectual life country 40 years new forces global capitalism These “million negotiations democracy” slow pace economic reforms also mean India might stable peaceful negotiated transition future say China It might also avoid deleterious side effects unprepared capitalist society Russia Although slower India likely preserve way life civilization diversity tolerance spirituality onslaught global culture

Does culture matter

Cultural explanations vigorous industry India hundred years Colonial officials routinely blamed Indias poverty otherworldly spirituality Hindu life fatalistic beliefs Max Weber attributed absence development caste system Gunnar Myrdal Swedish economist found Indias social system attitudes important cause “low level equilibrium” low productivity primitive production techniques low levels living34

Deepak Lal another economist similarly explained economic stagnation low level “Hindu equilibrium” around caste system bought stability context political warfare monsoon failure climatic uncertainty labor shortage undervalued merchant class35 David Landes historian blames enervating heat deleterious work For reason rich countries lie temperate zones poor tropics semitropics36

While institutions culture matter undoubtedly skeptical national stereotypes easy cultural explanations sort common hundred years ago In experience successful Hindu entrepreneurs extremely otherworldly religion aggressive business The Indian farmer despite caught caste system responds quickly market based incentives Green Revolution testifies Brahmins supposed contempt manual labor plough land vigorously And Rajput Thakurs never worked living shed feudal ways sake commercial opportunity Moreover substantial nonHindus India communities also stuck rut stagnation Other Asian countries equally backward “Hindu equilibrium” explain away stagnation Finally Indians migrate countries perform better

Thus I uncomfortable “otherworldly values Hindus” “immobilizing effects caste system” “conservative habits merchant caste” I believe Sir John Hicks Economic Principle trump cases It states “people would act economically opportunity advantage presented would take it”37 It explains diffusion Green Revolution across India also demographic transitions currently underway many states

When seeking explanation nations wealth poverty preferred method begin economic factors proximate causes motivate businessman investthe size market capability suppliers distribution hurdles state competition If satisfy I seek answers institutions course intimately tied culture I found institutions evolve rapidly incentives change society transferred fairly quickly example 1990s India able dismantle many institutions Nehruvian socialism replace capitalist institutions Finally none factors provide satisfactory explanation I turn attitudes social structure

I find Deepak Lalls distinction material cosmological beliefs useful38The material beliefs civilization ways making living subject economics cosmological ones live realm culture The rise west accompanied change sets beliefs East Asias success needed mainly change material beliefs—it become prosperous without losing soul In words possible modernize without westernizing Ever since British Raj material beliefs changing India unlike cosmological beliefs

Our continuing inability distinguish “modern” “western” India surely cause grief If could accept great deal modern western culture especially material beliefs Wests property universal critical way thinking belongs rational human beings We would waste energies swadeshi protectionism hindutva preserving ancient Hindu civilization futile language debates “remove English primary schools” The debate modernisation westernisation begun early nineteenth century Ram Mohan Roy continues rage India At root fear loss Indian way life The older generation fears young whose minds decolonised confident adopting Wests material beliefs without fearing loss cosmological ones

When born republic Constitution drafted one tallest leaders land could foresee problem ail even today BR Ambedkar warned us divide divide caste rich poor The recent Oxfam Report Inequality India testament Somewhere along line failed bridge divide

We progressed indubitably failed progress collectively Poverty hunger still ails weakest among us I remember watching one video Raghav Bahl mentioned India mixed economy actually got worst worlds Ours capitalist economy even Indiras 42nd amendment isnt socialist economy either

I Rahul fanboy I supported Modi voted BJP I concur Rahuls tweet announces MIG says cannot build new India millions brothers  sisters suffer scourge poverty

While happening India west USA Democrats making comeback recently back House diverse bunch Reps putting leash meglomaniac President The hotly debated topic eyesore Fox News AOCs 70 Marginal Tax Rate campaigned probably take forward

All three events happening time I see debate India Our divide growing cannot collectively grow take care poor weakened ones Here interesting statistic

I understand say Ambani ultra rich people notional wealth lies stocks This capitalistic thought factually correct time incomplete Ambanis wealth lies RILs stocks STOCKS PAY DIVIDENDS Ambani according reporthttpswwwbloombergquintcombusinessmukeshambanisdividendincomefromrelianceindustriestrumpshissalary made Rs 14553 crore dividend stake company last 10 years  Rs 1804 crore 2018 alone salary Rs 15 crore annually

So yeah cannot build new India millions brothers sisters suffer scourge poverty MIG sure hell seems nice idea talking execution right taxing ultra rich like AOC says cannot ruled India well This India probe Mars rank 103 119 countries Global Hunger Index divide real

Now I confrontational I even see faults whole thing But man behind desk whole different story When I went old Id like close account looked statement transactions And I pointed faulty ones started blaming those

He used shitty ass analogy I quote pick pocket steals person person doesnt realise blame lies person realising Yea right pickpocket angel stealing man carrying wallet What fuck victim blaming nonsense

Business/Finance,India States states much populated govern efficiently,8,9zgjc8,bikbar1,4,"Hello everyone lets discuss states We know states populated govern efficiently However creation many smaller states difficult So need Autonomous Regions AR

For example UP close 200 million people There four countries earth population UP  Even Maharashtra Bihar 100 million plus people 2011 West Bengal 91 million 2011 There 13 countries earth 100 million club The US state highest population California 39 mil 11 states that

So seems better serving populace need states lesser population State governments tend keep power hands select leaders thus failed spread development evenly around state

However dividing states smaller one would problematic It would create political shit storms turmoils powerful central government would withstand Just see happened creation Telengana 

So better solution would dividing states semiautonomous regions There 14 regions already exist India like Gorkhaland Bodoland Kargil Ladakh etc

Bigger states divided autonomous regions AR It would local governments limited powers

The ARs could like that

1 Population 10 millions except Metropolis ARs like Mumbai Kolkata etc

2 The local government AR formed via Panchayet Municipal elections elected members Another extra election avoided

3 These ARs powers funds village town developments local road constructions sanitations health cares school education waterbody forest conservation tourism development industrial developments land land reforms etc

4 The state government control police judiciary state civil services higher educational institutions state highways etc

5 The state government central agencies collect taxes The ARs would collect local taxes like tolls small business license fees etc The tax revenues would distributed among ARs state governments central government rules finance commissions

6 The ARs would limited legislative powers would enables pass laws However would legislative authority state

7 So could hundreds AR Every metro city city form AR

Business/Finance,No Progress Panama Papers Despite 1800 Indian Names Disclosed,257,63lhl9,modiusoperandi,77,"NO PROGRESS ON THE PANAMA PAPERS OVER 1800 INDIAN NAMES HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED

The Panama Papers illuminate key aspect system isn’t working–because globalization allowed capital assets 1  individuals corporations travel freely 99  cannot

Globalization supposed free movement people goods capital But fact system set enable mobility mainly rich large corporations

The result global tax evasion offshoring labor elite flies 35000 feet problems nation states tax payers within them


PANAMA No questions asked

The ways India’s rich famous increasingly becoming public knowledge The disclosure many five hundred prominent Indian’s including Incredible India’s latest brand ambassador  Amitabh Bachchan owned offshore companies Panama latest unraveling All one say good company likes Vladimir Putin David Cameron Nawaz Sharif among others

Panama small sliver country Central America joining North South America Its immediate geographical neighbors Costa Rica north Colombia south It narrow isthmus separates Pacific Atlantic Oceans A 77 kilometers long manmade canal capable accommodating large ships joins two oceans The revenues long nations biggest source income since canal opened 1914

Panama soon found becoming tax assured investors privacy provided lucrative income The proximity Americas balmy Caribbean islands countries like Colombia huge cocaine production export business Latin America’s many kleptomaniac tin pot dictators made Panama even attractive Till long ago Canal Zone protection US troops served incentive Americans seeking offshore tax haven

Panama tax means country offers foreign individuals businesses little tax liability fairly politically economically stable environment Tax havens also provide little financial information foreign tax authorities This short reason Panama important moneyed people good reason hide real wealth

Why rich want hide wealth This simply officially wealthy really And honestly declared true wealth would liable pay income tax could also open many various charges corporate fraud malfeasances could earn hefty prison terms
To comprehend one must understand “captains industry” many sit Prime Ministers Council Trade Industry became rich powerful

When “industrialist” launches new project project costs usually hugely overstated The suppliers plant machinery pay promoter kickbacks become promoter capital Thus number projects individual promotes wealthier becomes But income declare So gets hidden tax This big bucks made salted away

A good part money round tripped back India via nearby tax havens like Mauritius Singapore Not surprisingly 2015 top FDI investing countries Mauritius 27 Singapore 21 Both home hundreds corporate entities act pass funds held overseas Indians Indian entities These countries little cutouts monies held distant tax havens like Panama Cayman Islands Bermuda Lichtenstein The smaller country pliable officials

The fourteen PSU banks control almost 80 commercial credit advanced India In addition government also owns two big project finance institutions IDBI IFCI large institutional investors like LIC general insurance companies like Oriental GIC The state ownership powers vested powers New Delhi political bureaucratic ensures projects suitably “gold plated” without rigorous scrutiny And scrutinize projects seldom fold system restructuring means lending money evergreen loans

The list NPA’s includes almost entire roster top Indian companies As June 2016 total amount Gross NonPerforming Assets NPAs public private sector banks around Rs 6 lakh crore The NPA figures along total debt 49 public private sector banks shared Ministry Finance response Parliament question According RBI estimates top 30 loan defaulters currently account onethird total gross NPA’s PSU banks Till March 31 2015 country’s top five PSU banks outstandings Rs 487 lakh crore 44 borrowers borrowers categorized terms outstandings Rs 5000 crore These businesses include Essar Reliance ADAG Jaiprakash Associates Adanis GVK GMR Lanco Some like Essar defaulted This stress problem fairly endemic

Of big companies groups Tata’s Reliance Industries AV Birla considered free financial stress Most money earned gold plating plant machinery invoicing exports invoicing imports retained abroad Has anyone wondered UAE second largest destination India’s merchandise exports 33 billion 2015 third largest source merchandise imports 262 billion 2015

The UAE also largest source legal illicitly imported gold Last year India officially imported 900 tons gold worth 35 billion The mysteriously owned corporations incorporated tax havens like Panama mostly finance exports And good part illicitly exported gold also

According Global Financial Integrity Washington DC based thinktank Indians estimated illicitly sent 83 billion 2015 Where money go Countries like Switzerland offer banking secrecy usually pay interest deposits So money goes corporations tax havens invested businesses world Have ever wondered many top businessmen managed become big overseas soon
This Panama’s world come 

There time Panama India synonymous cheap brand cigarettes manufactured Dalmia Golden Tobacco Company In West Panama mans widebrimmed straw hat made leaves Toquilla tropical palm tree That Panama forgotten Now Panama synonymous offshore corporations assured secrecy The times changed

Scumbag journalist 

Writes article saying Do math Does math

Faulty Basic Assumptions

A look JP¥  IN₹ exchange rate last 5 yearshttpsimgurcomNcmqjkW fluctuating around ₹06 JP¥1 part Heres longer detailed view last decadehttpsimgurcomtOxvgAM While spikes lows average seems sticking around 06 Rupees per Yen 

While Japans Inflation Rate trend graph certainly quite flat averaged last decade average remains nearzero Indias inflation rate trending downwards past decade accelerated downwards last 5 yearshttpsimgurcomSoCXbPi

The author seems correlate difference inflation exchange rate two actually linked directly For instance Indias inflation rates years 2009 2010 steep 1497 947 respectively During years Japans inflation rates 167 040 respectively The Yen actually increased value Rupee dropped value within respective domestic markets Yet exchange rate January 2009 till January 2011 2 full yearshttpsimgurcomDHgubGX remained relatively steady somewhere 0485  0550 average range 0065 One would expect see massive increase exchange rate one yen able buy significantly rupees But case So value currency international markets little domesticallyperceived inflation country

Another factor considered interest rate 01 may appear free Indian perspective Japan

Has author even considered scenarios winwin That economics zerosum game This deal great Japan It also good India 

So since author lazy schmuck heres actual math

We currently getting Japan invest USD 17 Billion project

Since author concerned exchange rates thats JP¥ 189 trillion  Which currently ₹ 109 trillion 

Note While writing I used figures like JP¥ 1892 tr ₹ 1093 tr calculations rounded last digit editing text order avoid visual confusion 4digit years like 1967 2067 etc So calculation precise looks

Over 50 years 01 interest rates amount payable end 2067 would JP¥ 199 trillion If current exchange rate remain constant would ₹ 115 trillion But assuming peak exchangerate last 10 years ie 071872  July 2012 India would repaying ₹ 143 trillion Thats STILL interest rate less 054 assuming loaned us entire amount Rupees instead Yen

So effectively worst case scenario got loan trillion rupees 50 years 05 interest rate

Now heres authors argument lack math turned head

Assuming 0 inflation Japan value currency repaid Yen equally valuable 50 years would paid JP¥ 199 trillion upfront So arent losing anything time Thats great them

But seeing Indias inflation assumed significantly 0 value ₹ 143 trillion repayment amount 2067 actually lower perceived within India Remember domestic inflation doesnt translate directly exchange rates So even YenRupee exchange rate becomes horribly high domestic inflation would actually cushion sum would pay 

Still dont get Okay try 

Heres reallife example using real data past

 I used link calculation exchange ratehttpfxtopcomencurrencyconverterpastphpA1093C1JPYC2INRDD01MM01YYYY1967B1PI1btnOKGo21
 I used link calculate inflationhttpfxtopcomeninflationcalculatorphpA6139C1JPYINDICEJPCPI2010DD101MM102YYYY11970DD201MM202YYYY22017btnOKComputeactualvalue

Lets forget trillions simplicity

Say Grandpa took loan JP¥ 189200 50 years ago 1967 01 interest rate value Rupees ₹ 3942 Today need repay loan 50 years You need pay back JP¥ 198900 According present exchangerate comes ₹ 115600

Now back Grandpas day ₹ 1156 lot money You could easily pay rent 2 months ₹ 100 In 1967 ₹ 100 average monthly salary India ₹ 1156 would nearly full years salary back Today ₹ 1156 pay 2 large pizzas In 1967 Coke ₹ 005 meaning could buy 23120 bottles Coke ₹ 1156 Today buy 115 bottles Coke amount original small glass bottles India experienced cumulative inflation 4000 last 50 years Paying back ₹ 1156 today feels equivalent paying back ₹ 3025 back 1967httpfxtopcomeninflationcalculatorphpA3025C1INRINDICEINCPI1958DD118MM109YYYY11967DD219MM209YYYY22017btnOKComputeactualvalue

Meanwhile Japan value JP¥ 198900 today dropped third 1967 value worth JP¥ 62000 timehttpfxtopcomeninflationcalculatorphpA6139C1JPYINDICEJPCPI2010DD101MM102YYYY11970DD201MM202YYYY22017btnOKComputeactualvalue Japan experienced relatively tiny cumulative inflation 224 50 years

So Grandpa paid months rent 1967 buy Japanese lender 2 pizzas 50 years later And Japanese lender actually lost money process Huh Guess thats interest rates higher currencies higher inflation rates

Now obviously author right Japans inflation remains flat 0 next 50 years Japan certainly wont lose money deal Which excellent However still means India nonnegative inflation rate actually coming top long currency exchange doesnt go absolutely berserk 

Assuming 3 inflation rate pay back ₹ 143 Trillion 2067 paying back ₹ 0326 Trillion todays terms 

assuming peak conversion rate past 10 years JP¥  IN₹ 071872 worstcase scenario

This ₹ 14 trillion far less perceived value domestically 2067 2017 

Put another way take ₹ 326 Billion today invest reaaaalllyyy shittyass mutual fund yields 3 interest thats impossibly pathetic seriously 50 years easily pay loan ₹ 143 Trillion 

If youre using Fixed Deposit scheme gives 7 interest per annum need invest ₹ 49 Billion Try herehttpwwwthecalculatorsitecomfinancecalculatorscompoundinterestcalculatorphp

So take loan ₹ 109 trillion put ₹ 49 Billion aside 7 fixed deposit account use balance ₹ 104 trillion see fit hire strippers invest solar power plants build railway What call 104 trillion bucks see fit without needing pay back You call free money Obviously wisely invest better outcomes But yes effectively free 

Now mind arent getting cash getting solid investment generate revenue pay dues positive externalities employment new skills training techtransfer economic growth connected areas increased urbanization reduced environmental impact reduced accidents lower congestion etc It also leave lot money government coffers available investment projects next decades many see decent returns investment next 5 decades

Yes Japan comes winner deal India The higher domestic inflation cheaper repayment seem Just like Grandpas ₹ 1156 seems like paltry amount seen 50 years later Obviously dont want inflation high sub4 inflation rate keep economy healthy reducing burden future taxpayers paying big loan

This btw reason invest money ensure gives returns least 57 per annum order beat inflation Because otherwise sitting bank account money actually losing value time



But wait Theres more


The 508kmlong Mumbai Ahmedabad High Speed Rail MAHSR scheduled completion December 2023 commencement date sought advanced August 2022

Initially high speed train 10 cars capacity accommodate 750 people The Times India said It increase 16 cars accommodate 1200 people

According initial estimates around 16 crore people expected travel bullet train annually By 2050 around 16 lakh commuters travel highspeed train daily basis

 The fares could range Rs 3000  Rs 5000

Source  httpwwwhindustantimescomindianewsmostlyelevatedpartlyunderseaallyouneedtoknowaboutmumbaiahmedabadbullettrainstorynzG4ROjD9IRE00FcK4fD7Nhtml

They want complete 56 years lets conservative give 10 years Lets assume next 10 years construction lowvolume trains running directly jump 1200 capacity trains 2027 ease math That leaves us 40 years repay ₹ 143 trillion using train revenues

The article claims 16 crore people may travel annually initially thats 44000 people per day itll increase 160000 people per day 2050 Basically intend increase capacity 360 40 years Since capacity isnt something increase exponentially well assume linear growth capacity 44k 160k The train completes single trip 25 hours Assume 30 minute boardingdeboarding time either end single train conservatively make 1 full trip 35 hours That means single train comfortably make 4 trips day 14 hours active duty leaving 10 hours maintenance jazz Meaning one train capacity ferry 4800 people per day


    16000044000  116000 people increased capacity 40 years
    1160004800  24 trains added capacity 40 years
    401224  20 months time takes add one train system

Basically One new 1200seater train added every 20 months 40 years starterpack 9 trains initial load 44k people per day

So averaged 40 years around 129 trains operating That gives us 21 trains making 4 trips day Side note 214 Thats 84 trips per day ways meaning assuming 14 workinghours platform 3 trains departing every hour one direction  one every 20 minutes  convenient Each trip capacity 1200 people 365 days year 40 years 

    214120036540  1471680000 passengers total

1471680000 passengers total thats 147 Billion passengers And much charged per seat per trip ₹ 3000 

That gives us total revenue collection ₹ 4415 Trillion 

Lets assume train runs 70 seating capacity average They would still collect ₹ 309 Trillion 

Operational costs around ₹ 412 cr ₹ 412 billion per yearhttptimesofindiaindiatimescomcityahmedabadYearlybullettrainoperationstocostRs412crReportarticleshow39191311cms comes total ₹ 1648 billion 40 years 

That leaves us ₹ 293 Trillion revenue need repay total loan value ₹ 143 Trillion 

That leaves cool ₹ 1496 trillion pure profit paying back every penny loan

Wait 

Youre telling basically drop ticket prices ₹ 1500 per seat act almost surely yield packed trains every day still pay loan 

I dunno Lets check 

 1471 billion trips  ₹ 1500  ₹ 22075 Trillion 
 STILL assume 75 occupancy ₹ 1656 Trillion
 Deducting operational costs leaves ₹ 1491 Trillion 

Hot damn pay train using ticket collection even price tickets ₹ 1500 using conservative estimates possible With ₹ 1656 Trillion revenue easily could allow increase operational costs ₹ 5675 billion per year whopping 38 increase operational costs compared ₹ 412 billion figure still able pay everything fine 40 years

Business/Finance,Our Banks trouble  need talk,426,47ogw5,kumbhakaran,93,"Amidst prolonged JNU controversy amp Jat Quota stir one big development constantly ignored past two weeks Our Banks PSBs declared 44 lakh crorehttpeconomictimesindiatimescomindustrybankingfinancebankingatrs4lakhcrorebadloansexceedmarketvalueofpsubanksarticleshow51078318cms worth Non Performing Assets NPAs December 2015 

Here I attempt break layman terms What affects us taxpayer Im finance expert please point errors I make I go lot complicated jargon weird things always complicated make sense it

What NPAs care

Loans whose three consecutive installments paid classified Non Performing Assets NPAs After NPA bad loan declared bank initiate process recovery restructuring loan It try get new management run projects auction collateral try recover amount rarely equivalent amount loan given Especially case big loans 

The NPAs declared recently mostly big corporate borrowers according sources around 6570 total defaulters big corps Take example Vijay Mallaya Kingfisher Airlines borrowed amount Rs 7000 crore 17 banks These loans declared NPA recoverable amount come mere Rs 6 crore Go figure much recovered 44 lakh crore 

On top Vijay Mallya resigned United Spiritshttpprofitndtvcomnewsbudgetarticlevijaymallyaresignsfromunitedspiritsgetsrs515crore1281435pfromhomelateststories got payout 515 million Rs 515 crore Good times 17 banks unitedly struggle recover loan amount 

So loans cant recovered happens banks 

Simply put register losses throw hands tell Government Sorry boss cant get loans backhttpeconomictimesindiatimescomindustrybankingfinancebankingstaterunbankslikesbibankofbarodacentralbankofindiaapprisepmnarendramodiofrisingbadloansarticleshow50990898cms We need make profits Pliss help 

What Government this

One word Bailout 
This whole thing turning big cluster fuck Sources saying government planning infuse Rs 70000 crore till 2019 PSBs calm things They already infused Rs 20000 crore year This amount help banks deal problem totality temporary measure ensure dont collapse weight NPAs 

Does Government enough money save banks

No 

Heres things government spend near future

1 Food Security Acthttparticleseconomictimesindiatimescom20160203news703137851nationalfoodsecurityactprimeministernarendramodifoodsubsidy 

2 MGNREGAhttpwwwyouthkiawaazcom201602ndapursuingmgnregabengalandupelection

3 Seventh pay commissionhttpwwwdailyexcelsiorcomoftheservantsbytheservantsfortheservants

5 Increased Defence allocationhttpwwwbusinesstodayinunionbudget201617expertcolumnsdefencebudgetallocationlikelytoseeminimum10percenthikestory229336html

The revenue hand doesnt seem rosy The government kept fuel prices highhttpindianexpresscomarticleindiaindianewsindiaexcisedutyhikedonpetrolbyre1litreondieselbyrs15 get excise duty The finance minister saying done reduce fiscal deficit fair But case money capital infusion banks come 

I point first two expenditure items I mentioned something present government avoided spending much till I dont blame GST plan didnt really work go appeasement spree calm voters

Well thats dandy well awesome whos fault it

This problem unfortunately cannot pinned single person party So Ive made list 

1 Raghuram Rajan  Reserve Bank India

The banks less forced declare loans Raghuram Rajan sent notices telling clean balance sheets He banks start fresh cycle loan disbursements boost investment country Its good move long term depends whether banks position handle burden point time

A Supreme Court bench recently pulled RBI ask WTF happeninghttpindianexpresscomarticleindiaindianewsindiabaddebtsrbisupremecourtbankdefaulters 

gt The bench headed Chief Justice asked People owing thousands crore public banks… big fraud Top ten public sector banks written Rs 40000 crore alone 2015 It Indian Express report Public financial institutions lending money despite knowing returns RBI supposed keep watch banks What it”

They asked RBI submit list defaulters loans Rs 500 crore To RBI replied

gt “The required information available us Banks required report bad loans consolidated basis

Personally I find response really strange periodic reporting big loans done Finance Ministry RBI How ask banks waive writeoff loans worth lakhs crores without estimate big defaulters 

2 Manmohan Singh  Previous UPA Government

If anyone blame These loans declared NPAs given time They could taken measure make sure banks prudent handing money didnt So left huge crumbling mass debt coming Like pus wound Ugh

3 Narendra Modi  Present NDA Government

If capital infusion aka bailout continues economy gets trouble NDA government definitely blamed The whole point power clean mess even want blame previous government The people forgive BJP major possibly catastrophic economic downturn matter responsible 

Modi projected right beginning savior economy Now economy facing challenge cant afford point fingers UPA But definitely Rightfully wont help matters all

4 Faceless nameless  The Banks

Aah yes These frikkin Bankers The biggest culprits bank managers responsible due diligence disbursing loans If NPA particular bank branch manager held responsible In case big loans top management give approvals also held responsible 

Through clever book keeping financial witchcraft managers sitting pile rotting loans They didnt reason tell higher ups terrible situation Until Rajan sent notice forced declare bad loans 

5 Big Corporates

The usual suspects They benefit immensely loan writeoff bailouts Just like Vijay Mallya They past decade taken lot loans proving bad assets banks Even Economic survey pointed corporate debts worrisomehttpwwwbusinesstodayinopinionperspectiveeconomicsurveycorporatedebtsconsumerspendmonsoonsstory229607html They called The Twin Balance Sheet Problem makes sense me

Some projects havent taken due land acquisition issues Infrastructure problems environmental clearances There limited investment coming abroad Therefore government eager push GST investment driving schemes past two years Didnt really work planned Even manage pave way pending projects corporations known delay milk maximum profits Eg KG Basin IGI Airport many 

So happens next Also TLDR

To put simply The taxpayer gets fed As always

Business/Finance,Last Week Indian Parliament 2 May 02 May 06,368,4it1ef,kumbhakaran,68,"Hello rIndia

I bring second edition Last Week Indian Parliament I got lot feedback last time people insisted I keep narrative based I shall I also included briefs PRS end legislative business transacted week 

Boy I stories today

Last week Rajya Sabha member suspended day making ‘unauthorised inane noise’ controversial amendment passed allows foreign funding political parties government day tactfully avoided embarrassed new ‘Jumla’ Big Tobacco fought Government Zero Hour Notices

Let’s get right it


Money Bill strikes again

The Bharatiya Janata Party BJP troubled lot They easy majority Lok Sabha allows push bills don’t numbers Rajya Sabha For past two years opposition upper house blocked legislative agenda creative use throats camping around speaker’s grand thronechair protesting away glory But Government day seems tricks sleeve They seem aiming completely ignore upper house using Money Bill routehttpsnpredditcomrindiacomments492acwletstalkaboutthenewaadhaarbillitcan Twice


The first instance ‘Operation Money Bill’ observed March 11 Lok Sabha passed Aadhaar Targeted Delivery Financial Other Subsidies Benefits Services Bill 2016 During consideration bill many members screamed bloody murder opposed legislation certified Money Bill It went Rajya Sabha recommendations The bill got passed 4 days later March 16 original form The government day seems hit Parliament procedure gold So merely two months later decided again

And time bring FDI politics

The Finance Bill 2016 passed Lok Sabha clause belong legislation namely amendments Foreign Contribution Regulation Act 2010 FCRA


BJP  Congress Secretive Team Players


The FCRA Amendment strange one Earlier foreign companies allowed make donations political parties For obvious reasons Otherwise entities like Monsanto would field dayhttpimgurcomAsZqfLk 

The logic foreign entities able influence Parliament make laws favor In 2014 BJP Congress found guilty Delhi High Court accepting foreign contributions UK based company Vedanta So government day decided deal making retrospective amendment FCRA act hiding within Finance Bill

This amendment cleared Lok Sabha Rajya Sabha say know ‘Operation Money Bill’ President’s approval come soon Say hello FDI Politics


The Curious Case Finance Bill 2016

During debate Finance Bill Wednesday Asaduddin Owaisi raised point order question government validity FCRA amendment He argued act comes Home Ministry amending Finance Bill goes provisions Constitution He demanded discussion suspended immediately since bill flawed 

The decision landed lap deputy speaker Lok Sabha Arjun Charan Singh looked like doglover cat lap Unsure Finance Minister Arun Jaitley away official visit Germany MoS Jayant Sinha tried ninja savehttpimgurcomG9lMcPM He told Owaisi Jaitley respond query replying debate

24 hours laterhttpvignette2wikianocookienetspongebobimagesee824HoursLaterpngrevisionlatestcb20130519222728

While giving reply speech Fin Min sort ignored FCRA issue Instead spoke giving funds Polavaram Dam It upset Biju Janata Dal Orissa enough stage rather noisy walkout The debate ended abruptly clause clause Finance Bill began 

Still word point order despite Owaisi asking speaker ruling

Cricket sounds 1httpimgurcomDKiZ6Mw

The Finance Minister made 49 official amendments Finance Bill speaker going one one Clause 233 concerns controversial FCRA amendment clubbed Clauses 220 230 schedules first fifteen passed together

Cricket sounds 2httpimgurcomwn6P3Mv

After clause clause consideration completed speaker gave ruling Owaisi’s point order denied Ignoring protests members called passage bill

Cricket sounds 3httpimgurcomJxBvCE6

Not single word FCRA amendment spoken day Just like super important law change political parties funded accepted Lok Sabha 

The Finance Minister like EpicWinhttpimgmemecdncomepicwino834502gif


The ‘Jumla’ escaped

Leader Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad raised Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation GSPC issue Rajya Sabha Jairam Ramesh written extensively The Hindu  Part 1httpwwwthehinducomopinionopedjairamrameshonthekrishnagodavaribasinscamarticle8486493ece  Part 2httpwwwthehinducomopinionopedcommentarticlebyjairamrameshonthekgbasinscampartiiarticle8533360ece  
To give short rundown ‘Jumla’ 2005 GSPC claimed KG Basin epic deposit natural gas worth estimated Rs 220000 crore They spent Rs 19700 crore period decade ‘gas exploration’ get even tiny whiff sweet sweet hydrocarbon gas mixture Five CAG reports past five years pointed discrepancies way GSPC operated The Congress dying dig deep issue finally Rajya Sabha They took shovels ready break earth singing merry songs victory

But struck rock called Arun Jaitley even started digging

Jaitley told Azad issue cannot raised Parliament Public Accounts CommitteehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiPublicAccountsCommitteeIndia PAC already examining The PAC committee selected members Parliament constituted Parliament India auditing revenue expenditure Government India The house cannot deliberate matters Parliamentary committee already deliberating

Big Tobacco vs Unhealthy Lung pictures

There three zero hour notices raised Lok Sabha session regarding increasing health warnings tobacco products 85 To give context government passed order 2014 mandated tobacco manufacturers show gruesome pictures decaying lungs cover 85 product packet 

The pictures would dissuade new smokers taking deadly cause proven quite effective many countries around world This order come force April 1 year battle raging Tobacco industry government sidelines udextermilburn talking ITC shutting opening factories postshttpsnpredditcomrindiacomments4inj30lastweekinindianeconomyfortheweekending weeks The Parliament also became stage battle fought filing notices favor government’s move

Last week May 3rd Baijayant Panda raised zero hour notice supporting government’s move increase warning size He urged government hold ground increasing health warnings implement order diligently 

On 27th April two members raised notice oppose government’s move namely R Dhruvanarayana Sharadkumar Bansode Both members spoke tobacco farmers beedi manufacturers adversely affected warnings imposed They wanted government consider plight farmers connected industry impose order

Do agree 

1 Social stigma The middleclass India attaches lot ‘status’ one living Among first questions one gets asked introductions include “where work” “Where husband work” “He used work Infosys got laidoff” doesn’t cut  

2 Identity selfworth Typical middleclass kids conditioned work hard succeed When one laidoff due factors beyond one’s control ‘business reasons’ one begins question one’s basic values 

3 Pressure relatives Those earlier generation – parents uncles relatives IT workers – equate ‘layoff’ ‘firing’ Right layoff may begin gossip “Ramesh fired Wipro I though well What wrong” 

4 Financial challenges  Many IT workers overleveraged finances “Investing” expensive upscale apartments houses cars whitegoods large EMIs credit card payments Sudden stoppage paycheck certainly hard 

5 Other practical challenges  Many laidoff single twenties early thirties Until recently ‘IT groom’ nice paycheck primecatch matrimonial market All news doomandgloom IT sector perhaps making families eligible brides grooms rethink alliances IT sector

Business/Finance,Last week Indian Parliament 3 May 09 May 13,194,4jko0k,kumbhakaran,37,"I good news 

The Lok Sabha functioned without even single minute adjournment business This third session history universe Lok Sabha session functioned ohsosmoothly 

I let Speaker House Sumitra Mahajan explain it

ZERO ADJOURMENTS PEEPALhttpimgurcomCNmZHO9

Madam Speaker super elated moment provide background music go post Take away SumitrajihttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvpUNVjsNoE80



Hello rIndia

In edition Last Week Indian Parliament talk great ‘Pillar Fight’ quorum house absence Rajya Sabha turned nukkad Ganpati Utsav culture day 

I also wanted write The Enforcement Security Interest takes deep breath Recovery Debts Laws Miscellaneous Provisions AMENDMENT Bill 2016 amend Securitisation takes another deep breath Reconstruction Financial Assets Enforcement Security Interest Act 2002 aka SARFAESI Act

But I realized requires whole new post

So lets get right it



“Hon’ble Members…”

“Absent Madam”


The Budget session adjourned sinedine Friday Rajya Sabha Wednesday Lok Sabha I can’t even count many times session I heard quorum bell ringing shrill begging members come inside house let business continue

For uninitiated quorum minimum number members present business house conducted Under article 1003 Constitution houses Parliament State Assemblies quorum onetenth total strength house So basically Lok Sabha 53 members need present order let house function

Here’s funny thing though quorum considered member present house brings notice speaker There certain ‘young’ Congress MP spotted constantly counting number members present I can’t name person obvious reasons The moment sees members 53 screams “MADAMMMM QUORUMMMM” 

Then sits back smirk face speaker sighs halts business quorum bell rings

Fun fact There two different sounding extremely shrill quorum bells Lok Sabha Rajya Sabha They heard throughout premises conversations cut short There separate sounding bells division house calls The members supposed rush house bells ring Super irritating ask If upto I would use following quorum bells

Lok SabhahttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvW2jONIjrM0

Rajya SabhahttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhTWKbfoikeg

Fun Fact 2 The Quorum bell rung Finance Bill Aadhaar Bill considered It rung multiple times debate Water Crisis underway Gives idea state affairs

Why Lok Sabha adjourned early

Because government didn’t seem legislative business left The Lok Sabha supposed continue till May 13 shut May 11 

After Uttarakhand Appropriation bill passed nothing left So afterthought discussion drought water crisis continued two days Since session coinciding five state elections lot members absent house I don’t recall AIADMK MPs participating even single debate session So basically maintaining quorum becoming big issue probably that’s decided adjourn Lok Sabha early


Pillar Fight


There silent battle raging Judiciary Legislature Executive In past one month many seemingly disconnected events happened look closer see tiny silk thread running Last week debate Uttarakhand appropriating bill Pillar Fight came forefront The story quite convoluted hold tinfoil hatshttpstaticcomicvinecomuploadsscalesuper6698523449330tumblrloq5o7rd4n1qzl8s1o1400gif

The Battle Uttarakhand

The Uttarakhand ‘crisis’ came conclusion last week Harish Rawat floor test got horse galloped away sunsethttps67mediatumblrcomff9fd687b5bb1a3256eef3428074b7bbtumblrnytqw4xu7G1u9i37so1400gif The floor test ordered Supreme Court take place without speaker 70 member assembly conducting The whole handraising ceremony recorded video sent SC verification News Channels showing Rawat praying god almighty saving seat process getting lot sympathy voters

PERSONAL POLITICAL COMMENT I won’t surprised come February goes around state addressing election rallies screaming “MODI TRIED TO CONQUER US BUT WE FRIKKIN WON” The ‘outsider invaded land’ pitch quite compelling Remember Independence Day No Indian Freedom Struggle I talking movie aliens attack humans win everyone makes end happy shit Same thing So well done BJP


Uttarakhand Appropriation Bill 2016 

“Speaker roxxx Heshe Supreme”

 Indian National Congress


Before crucial floor test happened Tuesday government day seemed weird sort hurry get state’s budget passed Parliament Monday I’m yet figure Finance Minister opening statement said passed state continue expenditure next four months He said budget passed Assembly state won’t allowed spend money

Jaitley LogichttpimgurcomRCstARp

The president’s rule Rule 356 imposed Uttarakhand 27th March 2016 day floor test supposed happen Since assembly state ‘suspended animation’ The central government opinion Speaker Uttarakhand Assembly conduct house per book let state budget pass even though Uttarakhand Government didn’t required votes

What Speaker complete asshttpimgurcomrX785ih

Members INC argued speaker Pillar Legislature right conduct house heshe pleases They also held belief Court Pillar Judiciary right question decision President Pillar Executive On 21st April Nainital High Court scrapped President’s Rule Uttarakhand thus challenging President 

Aadhaar Bill 2016

 “Speaker suxxx Heshe NOT Supreme”

  Indian National Congress

Now heres weird part 

Incidentally case Aadhaar Bill 2016 Indian National Congress challenged Lok Sabha Speaker’s decision classify Aadhaar Bill money bill Jairam Ramesh filed petition Supreme Court hearing scheduled soon I talking case read herehttpwwwpolicypeepulcomblog2016511theaadharbillisitariskworthtaking

In case INC argued speaker Pillar Legislature supreme decision challenged Court Pillar Judiciary 

I know I know It’s utterly confusing It’s also rather amusing INC speak favour bloody thing Takes talent pull off

So pillar wins

Zoom little 

Imagine three pillars side side 

The height Legislative Pillar decided party’s strength Parliament At moment Pillar Legislature standing tall MudiRoxx As case every party power center try find ways means infringe cut powers two pillars 

In case Uttarakhand Assembly Legislature taken Executive pillars shot Judiciary

In case Aadhaar Bill Judiciary challenging Legislature questioning highest functionary speaker Since Bill assented President also end challenging Executive If SC rules Aadhaar NotAMoneyBill strike gives decision Executive too

This battle underlined Arun Jaitley singular suggestion Speaker Lok Sabha Supreme Court summons Aadhaar case She ignore them

Madam Speaker ignore Just ignorehttpimgurcomLf89cDo

Obligatory song dedicated Mr Jaitleyhttpsyoutube1M8vei3L0L8t26s

The Pillar Fight rages much popcorn consumed process I singlehandedly making Act II profitable

I leave interesting comment made Kalikesh Singh Deo Uttarakhand debate

Before go let say “No The BJP get majority Rajya Sabha 2019”

Here’s good article explaining whyhttpindianexpresscomarticleindiaindiaothersinthistermmodigovtwillneverhavethenumbersinrajyasabha

Psst Umm… Noob question How Rajya Sabha Members elected

Don’t embarrassed don’t know Let give simple rundown whole shindig works If already know feel free skip part

To put simply Rajya Sabha aka State Council Members elected people elect state assemblies There proportional voting system place decides many members different political parties represent state upper house 

IRL party boss decides gets Rajya Sabha ticket The majority political party assembly gets send members parties The number RS seats per state decided according population state A member elected Rajya Sabha serves term six years

The Rajya Sabha unlike Lok Sabha never dissolved 13rd Members RS resign every two years making house perpetual entity Herehttp164100475Newmembersmemberstatewiseaspx list seats held state present vacancies details


The Rajya Sabha bid tearful adieu retiring members given chance express emotions They express emotions I done painstaking job going debates pulling interesting bits turned Rajya Sabha nukkad sabha

There major caveats career line Firstly hyper specialised infancy Very businesses offering jobs bio engineers So best option stay Germany PhD Not terrible option question arises This less situation every pure science field lot unknowns variables What I desperately want avoid situation I getting opportunities Germany I come back home degree isnt worth anything India 

This one option I currently isnt promising I havent even applied institutes yet Too much uncertainty respect career financing opportunities But passion And passion isnt something I say lightly I interested fields biology I I spent hours hours reading one Wikipedia article another like crack addict drugging keep high Here I referring one page interesting topic boom 8 hours later I 50 tabs open browser I reading research paper tissue engineering future applications One could say I passionate biology 

The problem I also like making money I say flatly I passionate making money I passionate biology And difficult comfortable career Biology AND owning house I dream buying latest PC rig god forbid good retirement plan I seen lack money family I never want position I borrow money someone rent shitty apartment I want provide future wife childrenI know prospect little premature still

Hence I went MBA rat race joined classes studied hellish year self loathing realising pathetic I maths I offer letter one top ten Bschools India It isnt MBA finance god level MBA I dont calibre I didnt score high enough tests fiance MBA pharmaceuticals The course amazing A lot learning opportunities 100 placement average package 8 lakhs lowest 6 highest 14 lot field experience 2 3 seniors last year bagged international placements pharma MNCs Kewl

Everyone around elated happy congratulating I sitting confused ever It indeed big break I depressed miserable 2 years tensed I life So part  dad  feel I accept plate right demand something better

I feel I economically forced choose MBA I exactly complaining MBA money science doesnt science passion money I know I making blanket statement certainly exceptions get general idea right I know I made decision long ago I didnt feel like I get good B school

One small possibility I see MBA pharma working biomedical devices company something close passion

They accused failing spot size risk bad US housing debt resold around world causing multibillionpound losses

8 Moodys And Japan  But think Moodys statement relation Japan The logic kind goes like this

             1 Economic growth low Japan pushing tax revenue welfare spending – hence budget deficit rises

              2 Given Japanese government doesn’t exercise legal right spend without issuing debt match spending rising budget deficit result cyclical downturn also means rising public debt

             3 Moodys asserts analytical conceptual basis provided rising deficits way problem per se rather reflection real problem – slow growth

            4 So Pavlovian fashion downgrade credit rating presumably suggesting Japanese government credit risk without acknowledging Japanese government never credit risk unless collective brain explosion Government legislates renege financial obligations

            5 They downgrade slow growth makes difficult reduce budget deficit without acknowledging budget deficit increase meet challenge slow growth

           6 But left ask two questions First Moodys logic would suggest want increase borrowing costs Japanese government reducing demand bonds lower rating meant scare investors believed type reasoning would negatively impact economic growth So sort logic Moodys model outlook saying Japanese economy damaged recession going make worse therefore worsen problem credit risk

           7 Second ofcourse neither implicit notion Japanese government debt carries credit risk ratings change anything anyway valid Note sign government paper attractive investment prospect might rising yields investors avoided demanding paper But Moodys acknowledges “undiminished home bias Japanese investors preference government bonds allows government’s fiscal deficits funded lowest nominal rates globally”

So would bet A corrupt capitalist firm made monumental mistakes past handing AAA ratings firms paying rate products millions investors every day purchase Japanese government debt stable lowest yields The investors buying Japanese government debt deficits rising public debt ratios heading beyond 200 per cent compared ridiculous Reinhardt Rogoff default threshold 80 per cent last 20 years

8 What mindless rule applied here

The whole thing mindless To repeat logic appears Cut deficits keep Aaa rating – would undermine growth push deficit debt – undermines Aaa rating

And politicians everyone else goes along nonsense We really bright race people

Business/Finance,I forwarding interesting story world economy How valid I leave Another whatsapp forward,10,7jrv4g,yasar434,8,"Amazing logic indeed This crazy world Interesting article written Indian Economist

Japanese save lot They spend much Also Japan exports far imports Has annual trade surplus 100 billion Yet Japanese economy considered weak even collapsing

Americans spend save little Also US imports exports
Has annual trade deficit 400 billion Yet American economy considered strong trusted get stronger

But Americans get money spend They borrow Japan China even India
Virtually others save US spend Global savings mostly invested US dollars

India keeps foreign currency assets 50 billion US securities China sunk 160 billion US securities
Japans stakes US securities trillions

Result
The US taken 5 trillion world So world
saves US  Its The Americans spend freely Today keep US consumption going US economy work other
countries remit 180 billion every quarter 2
billion day US

A Chinese economist asked neat question Who invested US China China US The US invested China less half China invested US

The case India It invested US 50
billion But US invested less 20 billion India

Why world US

The secret lies American spending hardly save In fact use credit cards spend future income That US spends makes attractive export US So US imports exports year year

The result

The world dependent US consumption growth By deepening culture consumption US habituated world to
feed US consumption But US needs money finance consumption world provides money

Its like shopkeeper providing money customer customer keeps buying shop If customer buy shop wont business unless shopkeeper funds The US like lucky customer And world like helpless shopkeeper
financier

Who Americas biggest shopkeeper financier Japan course Yet Japan regarded weak Modern economists complain that
Japanese spend grow To force Japanese spend Japanese government exerted reduced savings
rates even charged savers Even Japanese spend habits dont change even taxes Their traditional postal savings alone 12 trillion Thus savings far strength Japan become pain

Hence lesson

That nation cannot grow unless people spend save Not spend borrow spend
Dr Jagdish Bhagwati famous Indianborn economist US told Manmohan Singh Indians wastefully save Ask spend imported cars seriously even cosmetics This put India growth curve This one reason MNCs coming India seeing consumer spending

Saving sin spending virtue
But follow Neo Economics get fools save borrow spend

xiv Mahindra  Mahindra investing 150 crores Kharagpur

Finance Hub

Setting greenfield Finance Hub real tough thing BKC took 3 decades get built Bangalore tried It failed GIFT Tried In spite Brand Gujarat PR skills Modi failed attract many investors New Town Finance Hub attracted Getting 19 national level Financial Institutions commit investment buying land 13 crore  acre time span 4 years AMAZING boss
Is Media ever coming news Even coming portraying things negative light telling many plots yet sold

Tourism

i We know traffic Darjeeling receiving TMC came If want check pre2011 statistics Bagdogra Airport Annual traffic around 23 Lakhs Last year 2015 March reached mark 1 million air passengers  year 2011 Bimal Gurung gang creating trouble almost every day Bandhs stuffs like Do hear things That MBs diplomacy political shrewdness

Revival State PSUs

iOnly three states discoms profitable without subsidies  West Bengal Goa Maharastra  according Planning Commission 

ii Transport PSUs sucking hundreds crores subsidy every year Daily earnings CSTC 2011 20 lakhs Daily earnings CSTC 2015 30 lakhs

Now almost transport PSUs profitable

iii Loss making Tantuja Manjusha profitable So newly launched Biswa Bangla Brand Its profit PSUs More Profitable companies weavers craftsmen handloom workers benefit platforms getting orders earning money More direct well indirect employment generated Also  profits form nontax revenue state budget helps capital investment

Again Media ever highlighting things

FAILURES

The major failure generating white collar jobs  Both IT Manufacturing And happened market Brand Bengal well Not giving SEZ Permission perhaps stupid decision ever

But Media continuously highlighting stuffs In 5 years 2 Foreign Trips MB Media complaining On Contrary MB bureaucrats made several trips Silicon Valley tried incentivize HiTech Companies establish RD Centres Kolkata

BOTTOMLINE

Business/Finance,Heres India shouldnt adopt Nordic welfare model,39,2gg76m,rafaellvandervaart,105,"DECONSTRUCTION OF THE NORDIC MODEL

Most problems India face attributed consequences Nehruvian socialism country adopted 45 years I Kerala Politics cannot separated communism despite age old relic still refuses die out

Since reforms carried 1991 millennial Indians largely rejected archaic concepts focusing modernity But context new concept largely caught fancy new age Indians The Nordic model As experience I see people supporting Nordic model communism currently Kerala 

In slightly lengthy post I try deconstruct Nordic model two angles

1 Nordic viability India
2 Efficacy Nordic model

First note Nordic model Nordic model Nordic capitalism Nordic social democracy refers economic social models Nordic countries Denmark Finland Iceland Norway Sweden involves combination free market economy welfare state More less implemented around mid 60s said promoted sustainable state economy countries Calls made among policy makers India special mention Nobel prize winning welfare economist Amartya Sen implement reforms along Nordic lines India

NORDIC VIABILITY IN INDIA

Nordic Socialism Indian proponents Nordic model advocate establishing state along social democracy lines But truth Scandinavia isnt really socialist Scandinavian countries certain socialist characteristics high taxes extensive welfare systems However countries relatively capitalistic markets Scandinavian businesses mostly free regulation nationalization protectionism Sweden Denmark Finland rank higher US business freedom monetary freedom investment freedom fiscal freedom property freedom freedom corruption Norway ranks higher US trade freedom property freedom freedom corruption 

Source httpwwwheritageorgindexexplore

The overall point Scandinavian countries fairly capitalistic business environments Until India abysmal rankings parameters achieve free business environment comparable income levels consider comparable welfare model

 Economic calculation problem First proposed Ludwig von Mises describes signalling function prices Prices goods signals entrepreneurs adequately allocate resources When economic planning added mix distorts market forces prices This turn facilitates inefficient allocation resources wastage In macro scale presents inflation Larger economy harder becomes plan Scandinavian nations small economies homogeneous economic components would relatively easier centralize function But without demerits India one largest diverse economy world terms economic components involved As India last candidate sort planning History shown planning met sort counterproductive unintended consequence inflation numbers speaks itself

Bureaucracy social trust Scandinavian countries characterized high levels social liberalism trust Research finds high levels social trust increase economic growth According one study The size effect studies 10 percentage points higher trust associated half percentage point higher annual growth rate In Scandinavian countries 60 percent agree people trusted compared OECD average 40 percent

Source httpjournalistsresourceorgwpcontentuploads201108GovtSizeandGrowthpdf

There also case highly transparent nature bureaucracy Scandinavian nations As trust worthy nature bureaucrats trusted governing functions state Bureaucracy India hand absolute mess India features almost bottom transparency index As evidenced corruption Bureaucrats simply cannot trusted action would best left free bureaucratic control

Source httpcpitransparencyorgcpi2013resultsmyAnchor1

Taxation problem Scandinavian nations characterized high levels taxation income Although I go problems Nordic model must said countries grow spite high taxes Indeed several studies examine taxation across developed countries show determinants growth accounted taxation seriously diminishes growth At time must added countries high tax incomes corporate levels low Corporate tax average Scandinavian nations 25 compared 40 USA So possible corporate sector balancing economy Hence higher tax levels option India industry corporate sectors constitute marginal share overall economy

Sources httpideasrepecorgphhsratioi0130html
httppapersssrncomsol3paperscfmabstractid1699715

Economic history Nordic nations Most Scandianavian nations instituted Nordic model mid 1960s Before countries reaped benefit high growth facilitated laissez faire policies neutrality World Wars Welfare system see wouldnt possible surplus made laissez faire era India hand Laissez faire history It country home half worlds poor By instituting welfare state India would incentivizing poor souls continue misery

Figure httpiimgurcom9YhKdaEpng

Norway  Norway exception among Nordic nations Oil discovered North Sea 1960 country made switch welfare state When liberals US point percapita GDP Norway forget mention much result big oil interests Norway largest oil producer exporter Western Europe Norway produces roughly 200 barrels oil per person per year That puts number 5 world per capita oil production In words Norway successful despite government government India largely import dependent comes oil proven oil reserves It cannot bank resource wealth fund welfare state

EFFICACY OF THE NORDIC MODEL

In portion I discuss problems Nordic model Given series comparisons made Scandinavian nations USA various parameters While US paragon capitalism Over years show relatively high levels free markets slightly regressed recent years The main difference American system Nordic Model America mediumsize welfare state Nordic nations large welfare states That explains least part US economy generally outperforms Nordic Model US stats easily available online I took Give beak

As seen Figure US enjoyed faster rate growthAccording OECD US grew average 3 percent 1981 1991 33 percent 1992 2006 meaning average growth 32 percent 1981 2006 The Nordic nations contrast grew average 22 percent 1981 1991 27 percent 1992 2006meaning average growth 25 percent entire period The IMF meanwhile reports US growth averaged 31 percent 1981–2006 compared average 26 percent Nordic nations period

Figure httpiimgurcomgpTtjiApng

Figure measures per capita GDP World Bank OECD IMF CIA show Americans haveabout 6000 additional economic output per person significantly 20000 family four

Figure httpiimgurcomilG5UVrpng

Although per capita GDP excellent measure overall economic output relative population necessarily measure living standards Comparing US Nordic living standards requires numbers disposable income The OECD series disposable income Figure According study using 2003 data average person US 27000 disposable income average person Nordic nations Had disposable income barely 14300 less 53 percentof US level Even Norwegians bolstered oil wealth per capita disposable income less 16800 barely 62 percent American level Danes Finns bottom less 50 percent disposable income average American 

Figure httpiimgurcomanuxd8jpng

Personal consumption In 2005 Danish Finance Ministry produced numbers comparing per capita private consumption OECD nations As seen Figure average person Nordic nations barely 51 percent much private consumption average American The Norwegians prosperous even private consumption 56 percent US levels Both Swedes Finns less 50 percent private consumption average Americans 

Figure httpiimgurcomjIIqdocpng

As expected nature free markets Nordic countries lag US comes per capita GDP growth

Figure httpiimgurcomgjBFuGGpng

Last least defenders Nordic Model argue US suffers greater levels income inequality Various measures inequality Gini coefficients confirm “wealthy” Americans earn bigger share pie Upperincome citizens Nordic nations But data incomplete without also looking size pie As illustrated Figure poorest 10 percent Americans level income poorest 10 percent Finns Swedes Danes Only oilrich Norway noticeable gap data Iceland available What differentiates America Nordic nations income everyone else The rich middle class working class US enjoy higher levels income Nordic counterparts If nations judged prosperity poorest citizens Nordic nations certainly equal US Indeed even slight advantage though even advantage might disappear Nordic nations US levels immigration But nations judged factors beyond wellbeing poorest segment population US holds clear edge

Figure httpiimgurcomlDeXvnXpng

CONCLUSION

Excessive government diminishes growth And although Nordic countries’ relatively free markets mitigate damage caused high taxes high spending burden government hindering economic performance The Nordic Model preferable Continental Corporatist Model nations France Germany combines welfare state policies interventionism When I researching  Google news showed Sweden plans scale back welfare state due pressure 

httpwwwtheguardiancomworld2014sep11swedishelectionscracksshowingnordicmodel

These AAP Kejriwal types constantly backing welfare state I AP anything fix economic policies Ill Milton Friedman famously said cannot Welfare state open borders Sweden seems learning lesson In Indias case Free markets best option

Business/Finance,Long post  I hate high interest rates India,79,35kmvp,hopesforabetterindia,50,"Long time lurker Thought I would share rants India here
One problem India extremely high interest rates When rates high 10 compared 02 many developed countries cost business huge


Consider following scenarios

1 No one invest business return less 10 per year Otherwise park money bank earn interest A lot projects become unviable way Setting big ticket infra projects green field setups virtually Impossible without government financial assistance tax breaks

2 Property bubble  A 20lakh loan financed 10 rate 20 years costs us nearly 50 lakhs including interest payments So even property prices increase 150 20 years CAGR 5 losing money

If include cost money You would better investing 50 lakhs recurring deposit instead giving EMI The RD bring close 70 lakhs So property price appreciation 702020 250 68 CAGR break even money I oversimplified calculation including rent saved HRA etc
Compare western countries property prices hardly rise 02 yy

3 Polluting Truck menace  It taking truck operators 10 years breakeven cost ageing financed truck A truck operator look 10 annual return order make money investment To save money cut corners also overloaded producing even pollution Read recent NGT order banning 10 yrs diesel vehicles

4 Currency depreciation – Economics 101 A high interest rate depreciates currency every year Currency depreciation raises prices fuels coal gas important imports

5 Trickle effect – A lot goods services change many hands reaching becomes expensive every middle man would want earn 10 money invested Think cost fruit vegetables pay vs poor farmer receives Think petrol pump business dealer commission Rs 2 every litre petrol sold  

6 Trade deficit China – Ever wondered  cheap produce things China One reason low cost money We import every type shit China Things could made right India

7 Fiscal deficit Gold – Stupid Indians keep buying gold thinking gold appreciate like last  decade We 2nd largest consumer gold In reality gold prices  5 yr low But India prices risen Do know Hint – 40 currency depreciation

If USDINR 45 today gold would worth 15k 10gm


I could go would interested hearing opinion


Update1 Some said interest rates right need And 100 true I clear wording rant
Its  I hope India low interest rates Obviously possible near future

That money none illegal stash Indian crony capitalists The money starts India goes sight seeing trip across many countries finally gets Mauritius  finds way back India Foreign Investment

If illegal money circulation India Jeevatma illegal money circulating around globe Paramatma  language BJP folk understand

Jeevatma becomes one Paramatma indian sewer water gets mixed International sewer waters comes back India via Mauritius Pure Virgin Ganges water Foreign Investment  Modi snanam worship welcome folded hands

The black money say trying eradicate come back Foreign Investment gets lots subsidies comes back India

So whos taking away Foreign countries How take itLets moment forget TATA Birla Ambani Adani etc among fat cats individual fat cats like ministers  yes Ministers Many Ministers even  standard education property foreign countries coal iron ore factories abroad even whole islands names Some come newspapers too

People like Adani sell solar electricity states ministers make huge cut But get bribes sack carry abroad No show benami name property bought name money transferred HSBC bank So next minister benami comes back Foreign Investor

Many ministers go trips islands like Cayman Islands  Modi know Will Modi ask ministers submit travel itinerary period power audit 

Lets take example The Central Board Excise Customs Directorate Revenue Intelligence given report  scam involving companies inflating value coal imports Indonesia power plants thus siphoning money abroad Initial estimates agency pegged overvaluation Rs 29000 crore period 20112014

How scam happen If purchased directly Indonesia tonne coal cost 50 However handed brokers middlemen aka crony capitalists purchase Coal still Indonesia  changes hands 78 different countries paper alone So comes back India costs 87 

So multiply 37  70 tonne It involves states Maharashtra Delhi Gujarat Karnataka Andhra Pradesh Odisha West Bengal Kerala Each state lost 1500 Cr due scam

The culprits include state parties minister along Adani Ambani Ruia Jindal India cements etc Adani gained 6000 Cr illegally supplying industrial parts Gujarat State Electricity Ltd according Directorate Revenue Intelligence

Modi travelled India election campaign using Adanis Jet Its behind Adanis money  Modi able fund political campaign

He travelled Adani Australia get permission mining rights Just Nov 18 Adani given 6000 cr loan Australia mining project

Can Directorate Revenue Intelligence ask coal sold 50 sold 87  even ask theyll say business practice  Standard Operating Procedure Its perfectly legal cannot questioned court too

All companies changed hands process exist letter pads Benami Companies So DRI cannot anything illegal money companies understanding countries stored  wont ask even ask fizzle out

So govt supporting washing Black Money White routes question catching Black Money arise

Atleast coal bought 29000 cr lost examples operations taken place paper alone

There another Island Bahamas whose population 35L In 2008 export India  2200000 In 2010 grew  28000000 What think 35 Lakh people bought India What exported India Two companies done  Reliance  Essar  petroleum exported Even 35 Lakh people drive around 247 eat drink shit petrol cant possibly use huge amount petrol exported So go

This carried Ambanis Reddy brothers  swallowed Bellari powerful move state border karnataka Andhra Such efficient people  Sushma Swarajs disciples They exported high quality iron ore  much From ports reports says 5000 shiploads exported But Excise reports 4000 shiploads What happened remaining 1000 shiploads Where revenue Where invested

Doesnt Modi know this

So Black Money something hidden box go collect bring back deposit Rs 1500000 everyones account  Its handling black money practices  weve seen theyve devised ways make black money laudering routes practices legal This incidentally happened BJP rule No biased statement

According World Bank report period 1998  2004 vajpayee rule black money practices black money flourished maximum extent India Now understand news came today BJP leading parties income unknown sources 

In 2011 scams 2G etc started surfacing Advani started Rath Yathra Corruption Black Money saying 70 Lakh Crores Black Money stashed abroad Ill bring back Advani held iron Man  Lauh Purush  hell act like superman bomb illegal stashes abroad bring black money back bombed Modi 2014 took role got involved Anna Hazare etc personally making gullible statements fool people 15 L account

However UPA rule important case Black money tax evasion case Vodafone SC ruled cannot demand tax After Pranab Mukherjee brought rules avoid malpractices namely GAAR  General Anti Avoidance Rules person spoke vociferously allow none present FM Arun Jaitlee Not FM corporates crony capitalists bringing rule

During UPA rule BJP asked Congress bring names Swiss Bank holders Parliament Pranab Mukherjee ridiculed Parliament Swiss Banks giving names shall send Army BJP kept quiet turned Congress giving names Today BJP power Modi giving answer SC

Now BJP keen money stashed abroad So turned attention towards internal black money Jeevatma remember So doesnt Modi know kingpins involved Ok dont know find  Income Tax Enforcement directorate Revenue Intelligence CBI Finance Ministry disposal So departments doing

Either payrolls kingpins decided act So whole system nothing farce

So Modi trying bring Black Money ordinary people  never seen huge amount money quoted post  let alone black money Modi brought emergency situation panicked people Just demonetisation Modi met discussed 3 chiefs Army Navy  Airforce Why Because feared civil unrest wanted avoid This Army sent kingpins black money ordinary people put much hardships know lead outcry want avoid taken measures that

After BJP representatives asked removing 500  1000 notes BM curbed talk shows saying We never said anything like This step towards curbing black money

So drastic measure thrust common man Theres reason activity Its Black Money Fake Money totally irrelevant it

Business/Finance,SOS mother India Muslim But Fan Of India Right dont know support anyone solution,4,7bkc38,khwajanawaz,4,"Hi
Am normal internet user city India touring many different countries last years

I really love nation travelling I found everything called developed countries still developing

I generally came questions browsing many social networking news channels print media

I Have 1 general question citizens country Dont think problem fooled politicians

Why I came question
I dont think countries huge population safest womens dont crime happening bankrupt jobless people roaming around every country part it

What makes difference
Some countries low population managed better law low rate law breakers countries open sex everything dont sex taboo guys roaming around harm girls countries high rate literacy huge tax payers government rich average amount tax also manage serve best country countries huge population work strictly business make vacancies leave less unemployment country

Now country working on
I found none political parties actually trying solve issue jobs tax payers think trying even congress tried better step oppositions others try criticize try best fool people get rid solutions try misguide citizens country

Root cause
No political party trying best awareness opened space public voice

Reason
Everyone scared loosing position

I dont say demonetization right wrong common man studied finance know gst effecting people trader know one thing stop criticizing everything work together benefit even next one 34 years think country would powerful dominating world ever space

With criticism blame game dirty politics heading towards solution loop destruction always behind countries always developing country condition developed country keeps varying every generation high end techs literacy

We need work together awareness jobs tax payers food quality rather seeing low level scammer shouting higher

Please aware moving towards development situation continued maximum people stay government always

I pardon language misspelled grammatical issues I blog writer really pain way things going dont stand support government position together always situation forever think right time open eyes start supporting need government majority government lets support maximum give try option bare anyways supporting voting dont vote thats

There one million Indianorigin immigrants Canada But compared rising number Indianorigin immigrants Indian investment kept pace Canada However slowly steadily Indian investments trickling Canadian economy Economic stability become key Canadas success decisive attracting investors world shores Investment Canada considered safe investors hardearned money continues represent solid foundation future growth prosperity 

Canada No 1 investment destination G7 ranked 4th world best country conduct business period 201014 according Economist Intelligence Units Business Environment Ranking August 2010 report

Canada ranks 27th terms FDI investment India investments mostly development sector Whereas Indian FDI approved 2009 Canada restricted 570 million ranks 20th destination Indian investments 

Recently Windsor I saw big hoarding road showing name Aditya Birla I stopped looked admiration thinking last Indian investors made mind make Canada destination good 

Indian investors consider Canada especially province Ontario hub North American business activities Ontario liberal laws huge existing infrastructure various tax benefits investors relatively milder climate fertile farmlands without doubt best golf courses world neighborhood 

People well aware Indian investments automotive sector UK During purchasing phase Jaguar Land Rover deal Tata India investors commonly discussed Ontario bars restaurants Ontario hub automotive industries support services manufacturing automobiles big3 US Japanese car manufacturers like Honda Toyota Southwestern Ontario key entry point US South American markets

httpdataworldbankorgindicatorNYGNSICTRZS  Savings  gdp

Chinas corporate debt GDP around 160 GDP 

httpeconomictimesindiatimescomnewsinternationalbusinesschinascorporatedebtat160ofgdptwiceuslevelarticleshow48141056cms

Indias corporate debt  taking account private sector lending growth around 538  Based 2014 figures credit growth

httpdataworldbankorgindicatorFSASTPRVTGDZS

China 3x loan  gdp Yet 4x lower NPA banks balance sheets And despite banks facing debt crisis  It implemented lot basel 3 norms started around 2013 excuse used Modi supporters justify restructuring reality India already employs capital adequacy rations basel 3 asked implemented 2018 making implementation irrelevant Even take account Chinas shadow banking industry still much lower 

httpdataworldbankorgindicatorFBASTNPERZScountriesorderwbapidatavalue2014wbapidatavaluewbapidatavaluelastsortasc

The reason I mentioned China Chinas growth come last 15 years going 17 trillion economy year 2000 10 trillion economy driven FDI pundits India would believe But massive expansion credit therefore investment  Something tune 40 trillion dollars This led many believe massive credit crisis resulting malinvestment root cause asset bubbles around China Not mention slowdown economy

Latest figures show Indias NPAs stood 53 percent 

httpwwwlivemintcomIndustryPSkRuIxPOtkZBDECcgTHIKAllouteffortsontobringdownPSUbanksNPAJaitleyhtml

So tell us 

1 Massive amount corruption lending especially PSUs
2 A small percentage Indians mostly big wigs politically connected people continue avail loans without significant collateral cant pay back loans politicians help restructure loans

How times tax payers bailout banks Even bail time How long place People say oh implement basel 3  But let ask India already implements capital adequacy standards asked Basel 3 basel 3 do

All crony capitalism highest standard 

And latest meeting happening today finance The corporate sleazeballs asked NPAs restructured separate vehicle known restructure bank lending start 

What really needs done never done corporate honchos fiscal hawks Modi supporters awe continue use PSU banks piggy bank Of course lack backlash blind supporters means nothing going change

In reality whats needs done restructuring bailouts real changes

1Privatise PSU banks

2 Create watchdog independent like RBI oversee lending standards 

3Implement stronger lending standard internetional standards account fraud international models banks like JP morgan etc use lend

Again I dont see happening Caravan published article Ruais anyway shows audacious Adanis Ambanis And constantly get money every year  Meanwhile I dont expect Modi supporters ever go dear leader 

So enjoy paying taxes saving PSUs money directed towards crony capitalism

 Rail freight volume tumbles November

 Deceleration freight volume growth continuing saga Indian Railways Compared 85 growth year ago freight volumes fell 42 November year In November 2013 volume grew 3

 Even passenger volumes dropped 26 

 Thanks rate hikes gross earnings Indian Railways till October 8 higher previous year But almost 9 lower budget estimates

Slowing rail freight volume growth points poor state economyhttpwwwlivemintcomMoneydtcu77hT9hX5n7TgsgUMGLSlowingrailfreightvolumegrowthpointstopoorstateofehtml

Freight volume growth slows 2 June quarter compared 4 year ago In absolute terms incremental freight volumes almost halved

 More threefifths Railways’ revenues come freight services The slowdown seen revenue thanks freight hikes Goods revenues increased 65 July In four months July 135 Though revenue growth encouraging way budget estimates Thankfully expenses also rising slowerthanestimated pace But gap budget estimate actual amount large goods revenues

 Compared year ago expenditure construction new lines doubling tracks increased onethird first four months current fiscal year

Railway passenger fares may go up
httpwwwthehinducombusinessrailwaypassengerfaresmaygouparticle8082709ece

 Passengers may pay higher fares following finance ministry’s recent decision cut gross budgetary support railways ministry Rs12000 crore

 For freight barring coal core sector robust cement steel construction sectors performing poorly We may look bitter pills increasing passenger fares apart cutting costs

 Recently government increased Tatkal booking charges 33 per cent travel sleeper class ACIII tier ACII tier executive class

Reading railway tracks Turnaround plan numbers

 Most vital signs commercial organisation flashing red

 By Decemberend Railways carried 8 million tonnes freight last year The Budget idea carrying 85 million tonnes March 31 2016 looks difficult achieve 

By November Railways spent 44 capital expenditure budget It spent 41 funds allocated doubling

Only 28 Rs 1748 crore allocated works passenger amenities spent far


So see picture Indian railway financial health poor state It able meet projected revenue able get work done fast needs even funds assured

Was selection process subjective  Yes

Then RTIs came picture people started asking details selection objectifying criteria I mention authorities IIMs pleasure plenty It rejection process selection process So rather instituting better process added qualification criterion eg Marks Xth XIIth Grad etc clear get shortlisted interview So past years students performed exceptionally well academics throughout life dare apply IIMs pun intended p

It personal view creating Business managers curriculum marks hardly indicator Skills like Relationships People Management Creativity Street smartness missing people academic lives They really great number crunchers domain like Finance suits well

 We view deals HAL 2 Russian companies big positive IAF would find ease procurement spares HAL In 2014 serviceability rates Su‐30MKI fighter jets 46 However post setting‐up Rs 4 bn sales service centre Su‐30MKI fighter jets  Helicopters serviceability rates increased 60 In words means total fleet size 230 Su‐30MKI fighter jets 138 ready missions given time
 MoD time back set ardent task increasing serviceability rate 75 levels
 This in‐line MoD’s strategy bring entire IAF Fighter Jet fleet global serviceability standard 75 levels This could gauged recent Rafale deal signed French government promised India Rafale ensure 75 serviceability rate Also steep penalties imposed timelines adhered
 We see 2 agreements HAL Russian companies technical support provide maintenance services spares fleet next 5 years in‐line MoD’s strategy improve serviceability rate Su‐30MKI Fighter Jet fleet
 As result initiative expect 1 spares cost per unit basis decline 2 DPSU’s smaller unlisted players benefit
 Also see positive development MM subsidiaries point view much awaited uptick Aerospace business kick‐in However see meaningful contribution Russian side Aerospace seen FY2018 onwards only
 Lastly proposed JV manufacture Kazan Ka‐226T inter‐governmental agreement
 Signed Dec‐2015 Russian Helicopters JSC Rosoboronexport  HAL This agreement
assures localization production supply 200 Light Multi‐role Ka‐226T period
of 9 years First 60 helicopters produced Russia remaining 140
helicopters produced India
 On whole Indian‐Russian delegates meeting concluded 2 deals signed making way pipeline

Lakshya‐II tested successfully

 Since first test 2012 tests done to‐date successful Still expect induction Lakshya‐II IAF would take quarters tests done
 HAL company India currently producing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles UAV’s like PTA’s
 To‐date HAL made 39 Lakshya‐I Aircraft division Bangalore Of 23 inducted IAF IN
 In Feb‐2015 MoD approved DRDO proposal transfer technology ToT LT commercial production Lakshya For every Lakshya produced commercially sold LT would pay royalty DRDO LT Tata’s associated Lakshya projects since long time LT produced Launcher IA version Tata’s produced Launcher IAF version
 We view LT DRDO already worked jointly build production model Lakshya‐II
 Also countries like Israel Singapore Malaysia past shown interest acquire Lakshya Even though order made to‐date exists possibility exporting Lakshya MoD approval
 On whole induction Lakshya‐II Indian Armed Forces would positive companies like HAL LT Tata’s involved different stages manufacturing Lakshya

 Suppose US Treasury prints 10 billion new bills Federal Reserve credits additional 90 billion readily liquefiable accounts At first might seem like economy received monetary influx 100 billion actually small percentage actual money creation
 
 This role banks lending institutions receive new money Nearly extra 100 billion enters banking reserves Banks dont sit money even though Fed pays 025 interest park money Fed Bank Most loaned governments businesses private individuals
 
 The credit markets become funnel money distribution However fractional reserve banking system new loans actually create even new money With legally required reserve ratio 10 new 100 billion bank reserves could potentially result nominal monetary increase 1 trillion
